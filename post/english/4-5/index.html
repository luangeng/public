A Friend in Need

Somerset Maugham

1     For thirty years now I have been studying my fellowmen. I do not know very much about them. I shrug my shoulders when people tell me that their first impressions of a person are always right. I think they must have small insight or great vanity. For my own part I find that the longer I know people the more they puzzle me.
患难之交

萨默塞特·毛姆

      三十年来，我一直研究我的人类同胞，但至今了解不多。每当有人跟我说他对一个人的第一次印象向来不错的时候，我就耸耸肩。我想这种人不是无知，就是自大。拿我自己来说，我发现，认识一个人的时间越长，我就越感到困惑。

2    These reflections have occurred to me because I read in this morning's paper that Edward Hyde Burton had died at Kobe. He was a merchant and he had been in business in Japan for many years. I knew him very little, but he interested me because once he gave me a great surprise. Unless I had heard the story from his own lips, I should never have believed that he was capable of such an action. It was more startling because both in appearance and manner he suggested a very definite type. Here if ever was a man all of a piece. He was a tiny little fellow, not much more than five feet four in height, and very slender, with white hair, a red face much wrinkled, and blue eyes. I suppose he was about sixty when I knew him. He was always neatly and quietly dressed in accordance with his age and station.
      我产生这些想法，是因为我在今天早上的报纸上看到爱德华·海德·伯顿在神户去世的消息。他是个商人，在日本经商多年。我跟他并不熟，但是对他挺有兴趣，因为有一次他让我大吃一惊。要不是听他亲口讲述这个故事，我根本不会相信他能做出这种事来。这件事之所以特别令人惊讶，是因为无论是外表还是风度，他都让人想到一种非常明确的类型。要说真有表里如一的人的话，那就是此公了。他个子很小，身高不过5英尺4英寸，身材纤细，白头发、蓝眼睛，红红的脸上布满皱纹。我估计自己认识他时，他大约有60岁光景。他向来衣着整洁素雅，合乎他的年龄和身份。

3    Though his offices were in Kobe, Burton often came down to Yokohama. I happened on one occasion to be spending a few days there, waiting for a ship, and I was introduced to him at the British Club. We played bridge together. He played a good game and a generous one. He did not talk very much, either then or later when we were having drinks, but what he said was sensible. He had a quiet, dry humor. He seemed to be popular at the club and afterwards, when he had gone, they described him as one of the best. It happened that we were both staying at the Grand Hotel and next day he asked me to dine with him. I met his wife, fat, elderly, and smiling, and his two daughters. It was evidently a united and affectionate family. I think the chief thing that struck me about Burton was his kindliness4. There was something very pleasing in his mild blue eyes. His voice was gentle; you could not imagine that he could possibly raise it in anger; his smile was benign5. Here was a man who attracted you because you felt in him a real love for his fellows. At the same time he liked his game of cards and his cocktail6, he could tell with point a good and spicy story, and in his youth he had been something of an athlete. He was a rich man and he had made every penny himself. I suppose one thing that made you like him was that he was so small and frail8; he aroused your instincts of protection. You felt that he could not bear to hurt a fly.
      伯顿的办事处设在神户，但他常常到横滨来。有一次，我正好因为等船，要在那里呆几天，在英国俱乐部经人介绍与他相识。我们在一起玩桥牌。他打得不错，牌风也好。无论在玩牌的时候，还是在后来一起喝酒的时候，他的话都不多，但说的话却都合情合理。他挺幽默，但并不咋呼。他在俱乐部里似乎人缘不错，后来，在他走了以后，人家都说他是个顶呱呱的人。事有凑巧，我们俩都住在格兰德大酒店。第二天他请我吃饭。我见到了他的太太――一位肥肥胖胖、满面笑容的半老妇人――和他的两个女儿。这显然是和睦恩爱的一家人。我想，伯顿当时给我印象最深的主要还是他这个人和善。他那双温和的蓝眼睛有种令人愉快的神情。他说话的声音轻柔；你无法想象他会提高嗓门大发雷霆；他的笑容和蔼可亲。这个人吸引你，是因为你从他身上感到他对别人的真正的爱。同时他也喜欢玩牌，喝鸡尾酒，他能绘声绘色地讲个来劲儿的段子什么的，他年轻时多少还是个运动员呢。他是个阔佬，但他的每一个便士都是自己挣来的。我想，人们喜欢他还有一个原因，那就是他非常瘦小、脆弱，容易引起人们的恻隐之心。你觉得他甚至连只蚂蚁都不忍伤害。

4    One afternoon I was sitting in the lounge of the Grand Hotel when Burton came in and seated himself in the chair next to mine.
5    &quot;What do you say to a little drink?&quot;
6    He clapped his hands for a boy and ordered two gin fizzes. As the boy brought them a man passed along the street outside and seeing me waved his hand.
7    &quot;Do you know Turner?&quot; said Burton as I nodded a greeting.
8    &quot;I've met him at the club. I'm told he's a remittance man.&quot;
9    &quot;Yes, I believe he is. We have a good many here.&quot;
10   &quot;He plays bridge well.&quot;
      一天下午，我正坐在格兰德大酒店的大堂里，伯顿走了进来，在我旁边的椅子里坐下。
      “喝一点，怎么样？”
      他拍了拍手招呼侍者过来，要了两杯杜松子汽酒。侍者端来酒的时候，有个人从外面街上走过，见到我招了下手。
      “你认识特纳吗？”在我点头致意的时候，伯顿问道。
      “我是在俱乐部里认识他的。听说他是个靠国内寄钱过日子的人。”
      “是呀，我想是的。在这儿这种人可不少。”
      “他桥牌打得不错。”

11    &quot;They generally do. There was a fellow here last year, oddly enough a namesake of mine, who was the best bridge player I ever met. I suppose you never came across him in London. Lenny Burton he called himself. I believe he'd belonged to some very good clubs.&quot;       “这种人一般都玩得不错。去年这里有一个人，凑巧还和我同姓，我从来没有遇到过一个桥牌打得那么好的高手。我想你在伦敦没有碰见过他。他说他叫伦尼·伯顿。我相信，他加入过一些相当高级的俱乐部呢。”

12    &quot;No, I don't believe I remember the name.&quot;
13    &quot;He was quite a remarkable player. He seemed to have an instinct about the cards. It was uncanny. I used to play with him a lot. He was in Kobe for some time.&quot;
14    Burton sipped his gin fizz.
      “嗯，我实在不记得这个名字。”
      “他称得上是桥牌高手。好像对牌有一种本能似的，简直神了。我那会儿常和他一起玩牌。他在神户住了一段时间。”
      伯顿抿了一口杜松子汽酒。

15    &quot;It's rather a funny story,' he said. 'He wasn't a bad chap. I liked him. He was always well-dressed and smart-looking. He was handsome in a way with curly hair and pink-and-white cheeks. Women thought a lot of him. There was no harm in him, you know, he was only wild. Of course he drank too much. Those sort of fellows always do. A bit of money used to come on for him once a quarter and he made a bit more by card-playing. He won a good deal of mine, I know that.&quot;
      “说来也是件有趣的事，”他说。“他人不坏。我挺喜欢他。他总是衣冠楚楚，样子挺帅。长得也算英俊，蜷曲的头发，两颊白里透红。女人都对他着迷。你知道，他没有什么害人之处，就是野了点。自然，他酒喝得太凶了。这种人总是这样。他每个季度收到一小笔钱，靠打牌再赚一点。他赢了我不少钱，这我可知道。”

16    Burton gave a kindly chuckle13. I knew from my own experience that he could lose money at bridge with a good grace. He stroked his shaven chin with his thin hand; the veins stood out on it and it was almost transparent15.
      伯顿和善地咯咯一笑。我的处世经验告诉我，他打桥牌输起钱来时一定是大大方方的。他用瘦小的手摸了摸剃得光光的下巴；手上青筋鼓起，手白得几乎透明。

17    &quot;I suppose that is why he came to me when he went broke, that and the fact that he was a namesake of mine. He came to see me in my office one day and asked me for a job. I was rather surprised. He told me that there was no more money coming from home and he wanted to work. I asked him how old he was.
      “大概就是因为这个，当他落得一文不名的时候，就来找我了，再说他和我同姓。有一天，他到我办事处来见我，要我给他个差使。当时我颇为惊讶。他告诉我说家里不再给他寄钱了，他要干活儿了。我问他多大年纪。

18    &quot;'Thirty-five,' he said.
19    &quot;'And what have you been doing hitherto?' I asked him.
20    &quot;'Well, nothing very much,' he said.
21    I couldn't help laughing.
22    &quot;'I'm afraid I can't do anything for you just yet,' I said. 'Come back and see me in another thirty-five years, and I'll see what I can do.'
      “‘35，’他说。
      “‘你一直都干什么来着？’我问道。
      “‘嗯，没怎么干过事。’他说。
      “我禁不住笑了。
      “‘眼下恐怕不能帮你忙了，’我说。‘你再过35年来找我，到时候我再看看能帮些什么忙。’

23    &quot;He didn't move. He went rather pale. He hesitated for a moment and then he told me that he had had bad luck at cards for some time. He hadn't been willing to stick to bridge, he'd been playing poker16, and he'd got trimmed. He hadn't a penny. He'd pawned everything he had. He couldn't pay his hotel bill and they wouldn't give him any more credit. He was down and out. If he couldn't get something to do he'd have to commit suicide.
      “他没有动弹，脸色变得相当苍白。他犹豫了一会儿，然后对我说，这一阵子他牌运一直不好。原来他不甘心老打桥牌，便赌起扑克来，结果输了个精光。他一个子儿也没有，所有的东西都拿去当了。他连酒店的账都付不出，人家也不肯再赊账给他。他已经山穷水尽。要是找不到点事干，他只好自杀。

24    &quot;I looked at him for a bit. I could see now that he was all to pieces. He'd been drinking more than usual and he looked fifty. The girls wouldn't have thought so much of him if they'd seen him then.
      “我瞧了他一会儿。我能看出他已经完全垮了。这一阵子他酒喝得比以前更凶，看上去足有50岁。姑娘们当时要是瞧见他，准不会对他那么着迷了。

25    &quot;'Well isn't there anything you can do except play cards?' I asked him.
26    &quot;'I can swim,' he said.
27    &quot;'Swim!'
28    &quot;I could hardly believe my ears; it seemed such an insane answer to give.
29    &quot;'I swam for my university.'
      “‘嗯，你除了打牌以外，难道什么也不会干吗？’我问他。
      “‘我会游泳，’他说。
      “‘游泳！’
      “我几乎以为自己听错了呢；这种回答听起来简直是牛头不对马嘴。
      “‘我读大学时曾经代表学校参加游泳比赛。’

30    &quot;I got some glimmering of what he was driving at. I've known too many men who were little tin gods at their university to be impressed by it.
31    &quot;'I was a pretty good swimmer myself when I was a young man,' I said.
32    &quot;Suddenly I had an idea.&quot;
33    Pausing in his story, Burton turned to me.
      “我听出了一点他话里的意思。上大学时自以为了不起的人我见得多了，我才不吃这套呢。
      “‘本人年轻时也是个游泳好手，’我说。
      “突然，我有了个想法。”
      伯顿停了下来，看着我。

34    &quot;Do you know Kobe?&quot; he asked.
35    &quot;No,&quot; I said, &quot;I passed through it once, but I only spent a night there.&quot;
36    &quot;Then you don't know the Shioya Club. When I was a young man I swam from there round the beacon and landed at the creek of Tarumi. It's over three miles and it's rather difficult on account of the currents round the beacon. Well, I told my young namesake about it and I said to him that if he'd do it I'd give him a job.
      “你对神户熟悉吗？”他问。
      “不熟悉，”我说，“从前有一次路过那里，只呆了一个晚上。”
      “那么，你不会知道盐谷俱乐部吧。我年轻的时候，曾经从那里出发，游过灯塔直到垂水小溪上岸。一共3英里多路，灯塔一带有激流，游起来挺费劲。于是，我把这事告诉了那位与我同姓的年轻人，并对他说，要是他能游过去，我就给他一个差使。

37    &quot;I could see he was rather taken aback.
38    &quot;'You say you're a swimmer,' I said.
39    &quot;'I'm not in very good condition,' he answered.
40    &quot;I didn't say anything. I shrugged my shoulders. He looked at me for a moment and then he nodded.
41    &quot;'All right,' he said. 'When do you want me to do it?'
      “我看得出，他吓了一跳。
      “‘你不是说你是游泳好手吗？’我说。
      “‘我现在身体状况不太好，’他回答说。
      “我什么也没说，只是耸了耸肩。他望了我一会儿，然后点了点头。
      “‘好吧，’他说了，‘你要我什么时候游呢？’

42    &quot;I looked at my watch. It was just after ten.
43    &quot;'The swim shouldn't take you much over an hour and a quarter. I'll drive round to the creek at half past twelve and meet you. I'll take you back to the club to dress and then we'll have lunch together.'
44    &quot;'Done,' he said.
      “我看了看表。刚过十点。
      “‘你游这段距离大概要花一个钟头零一刻多一些。我到12点半开车到小溪那里去接你，带你到俱乐部换衣服，然后一起吃午饭。’
      “‘就这样吧，’他说。

45    &quot;We shook hands. I wished him good luck and he left me. I had a lot of work to do that morning and I only just managed to get to the creek at Tarumi at half past twelve. But I needn't have hurried; he never turned up.&quot;
46    &quot;Did he funk it at the last moment?&quot; I asked.
      “我们握了握手。我祝他好运，他就走了。那天上午我有好些事要办，到12点半总算勉强赶到了垂水小溪。其实我根本用不着这么赶，他压根儿就没露面。”
      “他临阵脱逃了？”我问。

47    &quot;No, he didn't funk it. He started all right. But of course he'd ruined his constitution by drink and dissipation. The currents round the beacon were more than he could manage. We didn't get the body for about three days.&quot;
      “没有，他没有临阵脱逃。他确实出发了。当然喽，他喝酒作乐早把身体搞垮了。灯塔周围的激流他对付不了。大约有三天，我们都没找到尸体。”

48    I didn't say anything for a moment or two. I was a trifle shocked. Then I asked Burton a question.
49    &quot;When you made him that offer of a job, did you know he'd be drowned?&quot;
50    He gave a little mild chuckle and he looked at me with those kind and candid blue eyes of his. He rubbed his chin with his hand.
51    &quot;Well, I hadn't got a vacancy in my office at the moment.&quot;
      我好一会儿什么话也没说。我感到有些震惊。然后我问了伯顿一个问题。
      “你提出给他差使的时候，是不是知道他准会淹死？”
      他轻轻地咯咯一笑，用那双和善又坦率的蓝眼睛望着我。他用手摩挲着下巴。
      “哦，那时我的办事处可没有空缺呀。”

A Man of the World

Ernest Hemingway

1    The blind man knew the sounds of all the different machines in the Saloon. I don't know how long it took him to learn the sounds of the machines but it must have taken him quite a time because he only worked one saloon at a time. He worked two towns though and he would start out of The Flats along after it was good and dark on his way up to Jessup. He'd stop by the side of the road when he heard a car coming and their lights would pick him up and either they would stop and give him a ride or they wouldn't and would go on by on the icy road. (1) It would depend on how they were loaded and whether there were women in the car because the blind man smelled plenty strong and especially in winter. But someone would always stop for him because he was a blind man.
一条好汉

欧内斯特·海明威

      那个盲人对酒馆里不同机器发出的声响了如指掌。我不知道他用了多久才把各种机器的声音一一辨清，但这事儿准花了他不少时间，因为他一次只在一家酒馆做。不过他在两个镇上都有活，他会在弗拉特先做，一直到天全黑了，再前往杰塞普。听见有车开过来他就会在路旁停下来，车灯照见他，有时他们会停下车来带他一程，有时则不，径直在冰冻的路面从他身旁开过。带不带他要看车上有没有坐满，有没有女士，因为瞎子身上气味很重，尤其在冬天。但总会有人停车让他上去，因为他是个盲人。

2    Everybody knew him and they called him Blindy, which is a good name for a blind man in that part of the country, and the name of the saloon that he threw his trade to was The Pilot. Right next to it was another saloon, also with gambling and a dining room, that was called The Index. Both of these were the names of mountains and they were both good saloons with old-days bars and the gambling was about the same in one as in the other except you ate better in The Pilot probably. Blindy probably preferred The Pilot because the machines were right along the left-hand wall as you came in and faced the bar. This gave him better control over them than he would have had at The Index where they were scattered on account it was a bigger place with more room. On this night it was really cold outside and he came in with icicles on his mustache and he didn't look really very good. (2) Even his smell was froze but that wasn't for very long and he started to put out almost as soon as the door was shut. It was always hard for me to look at him but I was looking at him carefully because I knew he always rode and I didn't see how he would be frozen up so bad. Finally I asked him.
      人人都认识他，叫他盲汉，在那一带，这是对盲人表示尊重的称呼，他干活的那家酒馆叫派勒特。就在隔壁又是一家酒吧，也有赌博机和餐厅，店名叫做印岱克斯。这两家店名原来都是山名，两家酒馆都不错，都有那种旧式的吧台，赌博机也都没什么两样，只不过派勒特的菜肴可能略好一些。盲汉可能喜欢派勒特，因为进门就是吧台，赌博机都沿左墙一溜儿摆放。赌博机集中摆放，他就容易控制，不像在印岱克斯，因为地方大，空间多，机器四处摆放着。这天晚上，外面冷得够呛，他进来时胡茬上还挂着冰柱，那样子看上去不太对劲。连他的臭味也冻住了，但冻住的时间不长，门一关上，他身上又发出气味了。过去我总是不忍心看他，不过那晚我却仔细打量了他，因为我知道他总能搭上便车，我纳闷，他怎么会冻成这样。我终于问他了。

3    &quot;Where you walk from, Blindy?&quot;
4    &quot;Willie Sawyer put me out of his car down below the railway bridge. There weren't no more cars come and I walked in.&quot;
5    &quot;What did he put you afoot for?&quot; somebody asked.
6    &quot;Said I smelled too bad.&quot;
      “你从哪儿走过来的，盲汉？”
      “威利·索亚在铁路桥下面把俺撵下车。一直没别的车开过来，俺就一路走来了。”
      “他干嘛要让你下去走？”有人问。
      “说俺身上气味重。”

7    Somebody hit on a machine but it wasn't any heavy hit. Blindy moved on it just the same. It was a quarter machine and the young fellow who was playing it gave him a quarter sort of reluctantly. Blindy felt it before he put it in his pocket.
      有人玩吃角子机赢了，可没有赢多少。盲汉还是走了过去。那是台25分币的吃角子机，在玩的那小伙子不很情愿地给了他一个2角5分的硬币。盲汉摸了摸硬币，然后放进衣袋。

8    &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said. &quot;You'll never miss it.&quot;
9    The young fellow said, &quot;Nice to know that,&quot; and put a quarter back in the machine and pulled down again.
10    He hit again but this time pretty good and he scooped in the quarters and gave a quarter to Blindy.
11    &quot;Thanks,&quot; Blindy said, &quot;You're doing fine.&quot;
12    &quot;Tonight's my night,&quot; the young fellow who was playing said.       “多谢了，”他说。“你准会赢的。”
      年轻人说：“那敢情好，”说罢又投了个2角5分的硬币进去，再往下拉了一下。
      他又赢了，可这次赢了不少。他捞起大把大把2角5分的硬币，给了盲汉一个。
      “多谢，”盲汉说，“打得不错。”
      “今晚咱运气好，”正在玩的年轻人说。

13    (3) &quot;Your night is my night,&quot; Blindy said and the young fellow went on playing but he wasn't doing any good any more and Blindy was so strong standing by him and he looked so awful and finally the fellow quit playing and came over to the bar.
      “你走运，俺沾光，”盲汉说。年轻人继续在玩，可不再像刚才那样赢钱；站在他旁边的瞎子气味实在难闻，样子又那么惹人厌烦，年轻人终于歇手不玩了，向酒吧间走去。

14    &quot;What will yours be, Tom?&quot; Frank the bartender asked me. &quot;This is on the house.&quot;
15    &quot;I was figuring on shoving.&quot;
16    &quot;Have one first then.&quot;
17    Frank asked the young fellow what he would drink and the young fellow took the same. The whisky was Old Forester.
      “你想喝什么，汤姆？”名叫弗兰克的酒吧间侍者问我。“酒店请客。”
      “我想回去了。”
      “那就先喝上一杯吧。”
      弗兰克问年轻人要喝什么，年轻人要了同样的酒。是老林务员威士忌。

18    I nodded to him and raised my drink and we both sipped at the drinks. Blindy was down at the far end of the machines. I think he figured maybe no one would come in if they saw him at the door. Not that he was self-conscious.
      我朝他点点头，举起酒杯，两人都呷了一口。盲汉站在那排赌博机的最尽头。我想，他这是估摸着要是见他在门口，没人会进来。这倒不是他怕难为情。

19    &quot;How did that man lose his sight?&quot; the young fellow asked me.
20    &quot;In a fight,&quot; Frank told him.
21    &quot;I wouldn't know,&quot; I told him.
22    &quot;Him fight?&quot; the stranger said. He shook his head.
23    &quot;Yeah,&quot; Frank said. &quot;He got that high voice out of the same fight. Tell him, Tom.&quot;
24    &quot;I never heard of it.&quot;
      “那个人是怎么失明的？”那年轻人问我。
      “打架闹的，”弗兰克告诉他。
      “我不清楚，”我对他说。
      “他打架？”陌生人说。他摇摇头。
      “是啊，”弗兰克说。“他那尖嗓子也是那一架给打出来的。跟他说说，汤姆。”
      “我从来没听说过。”

25    &quot;No. You wouldn't of,&quot; Frank said. &quot;Of course not. You wasn't here, I suppose. Mister, it was a night about as cold as tonight. Maybe colder. It was a quick fight too. I didn't see the start of it. Then they came fighting out of the door of The Index. Blackie, him that's Blindy now, and this other boy Willie Sawyer, and they were slugging and kneeing and gouging and biting and I see one of Blackie's eyes hanging down on his cheek. They were fighting on the ice of the road with the snow all banked up and the light from this door and The Index door, and Hollis Sands was right behind Willie Sawyer who was gouging for the eye and Hollis kept hollering, 'Bite it off! Bite it off just like it was a grape!' Blackie was biting onto Willie Sawyer's face and he had a good pull and it gave away with a jerk and then he had another good pull and they were down on the ice now and Willie Sawyer was gouging him to make him let go and then Blackie gave a yell like you've never heard. Worse than when they cut a boar.&quot;
      “对了。你是不会知道的，”弗兰克说。“当然不知道。我想那时你还没来这儿。先生，那天晚上差不多就跟今晚一样冷。可能更冷些。那一架打得快。我没见到是怎么打起来的。只看到他们从印岱克斯的门里扭打出来。布兰奇，如今叫盲汉了，还有那个叫威利·索亚的家伙，两人又打又踢，又抓又咬，我看到布兰奇的一个眼珠掉了出来挂在脸上。两人在冰冻的路面上打，路旁都堆着雪，这扇门里，还有印岱克斯店门里透出灯光，霍利斯·桑兹就站在威利·索亚的身后，威利·索亚正要挖那个眼珠，霍利斯不停地嚷嚷着：‘咬下来！咬下来，就当是个葡萄！’布兰奇咬进威利·索亚的脸，他狠狠一咬，猛地咬下一块，接着又大咬一口，两人都倒在冰上，威利·索亚掐他的眼睛，逼他松手，就在这时，布兰奇惨叫一声，没听见过叫得那么怕人的。比杀猪叫还吓人。”

26    Blindy had come up opposite us and we smelled him and turned around.
27    &quot; 'Bite it off just like it was a grape,'&quot; he said in his high-pitched voice and looked at us, moving his head up and down. &quot;That was the left eye. He got the other one without no advice. Then he stomped me when I couldn't see. That was the bad part.&quot; He patted himself.
      这时盲汉已经走到我们对面，我们闻到他身上的气味，便转过身去。
      “‘咬下来，就当是个葡萄，’”他尖声说，一边看着我们，一边摇头晃脑。“那是左眼珠。他连声警告也没有就把另一只也咬下了。俺什么也看不见了，他却狠命踩俺。那才叫惨哪。”他拍了拍自己。

28    &quot;I could fight good then,&quot; he said. &quot;But he got the eye before I knew even what was happening. He got it with a lucky gouge8. Well,&quot; Blindy said without any ill feeling, &quot;that put a stop to my fighting days.&quot;
      “那时俺可真能打架，”他说。“可俺还没明白过来是怎么回事他就咬着我的眼珠了。他下手下得巧。唉，”布兰奇说着，不带一点敌意。“这下俺打架的日子也就到头了。”

29    &quot;Give Blackie a drink,&quot; I said to Frank.
30    &quot;Blindy's the name, Tom. I earned that name. You seen me earn it. That's the same fellow who put me adrift down the road tonight. Fellow bit the eye. We ain't never made friends.&quot;
      “给布兰奇来杯酒，”我吩咐弗兰克。
      “叫俺盲汉，汤姆。这个名字是俺打架打出来的。你都亲眼见到的。就是今晚把俺扔在路上的那个小子。咬眼珠的那个小子。俺两个一直就没和好。”

31    &quot;What did you do to him?&quot; the stranger asked.
32    &quot;Oh, you'll see him around,&quot; Blindy said. &quot;You'll recognize him any time you see him. I'll let it come as a surprise.&quot;
33    &quot;You don't want to see him,&quot; I told the stranger.
34    &quot;You know that's one of the reasons I'd like to see sometimes,&quot; Blindy said. &quot;I'd like to just have one good look at him.&quot;
35    &quot;You know what he looks like,&quot; Frank told him. &quot;You went up and put your hands on his face once.&quot;
      “你拿他怎么了？”陌生人问。
      “啊，你会在附近见到他的，”盲汉说。“你一见到他就会认出他。俺要让你见了觉得出乎意料。”
      “你见了他会害怕的，”我跟陌生人说。
      “要知道，就为了这，有时俺也希望有双眼睛能亲眼瞧瞧。”盲汉说。“俺只想好好瞧他一眼。”
      “你知道他现在的模样，”弗兰克对他说。“有次你走上去摸过他的脸。”

36    &quot;Did it again tonight too,&quot; Blindy said happily. &quot;That's why he put me out of the car. He ain't got no sense of humor at all. (4) I told him on a cold night like this he'd ought to bundle up so the whole inside of his face wouldn't catch cold. He didn't even think that was funny. You know that Willie Sawyer he'll never be a man of the world.&quot;
      “今晚俺又摸了一次，”盲汉得意地说。“就为这他把俺给撵下了车。他一点玩笑都开不起。俺对他说，今晚这么冷，他应当穿得暖暖的，这样他脸庞里边就不会着凉感冒了。他压根儿没觉得这话挺逗。你知道威利·索亚，成不了汉子。”

37    &quot;Blackie, you have one on the house,&quot; Frank said. &quot;I can't drive you home because I only live just down the road. But you can sleep in the back of the place.&quot;
      “布兰奇，喝一杯，不收钱，”弗兰克说。“我不能开车送你回家，因为我就住在路的那头。不过你可以在屋子后边睡。”

38    &quot;That's mighty good of you, Frank. Only just don't call me Blackie. I'm not Blackie any more. Blindy's my name.&quot;
39    &quot;Have a drink, Blindy.&quot;
40    &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Blindy said. His hand reached out and found the glass and he raised it accurately to the three of us.
41    &quot;That Willis Sawyer,&quot; he said. &quot;Probably alone home by himself. That Willie Sawyer he don't know how to have any fun at all.&quot;
      “你真好，弗兰克。可别叫俺布兰奇。俺不再是什么布兰奇。俺叫盲汉。”
      “喝，盲汉。”
      “喝，老兄，”盲汉说。他伸出手来摸到了杯子，很准地对着我们三人举杯。
      “威利·索亚那小子，”他说。“没准一个人呆在家里呢。威利·索亚那小子一点儿不会取乐。”
