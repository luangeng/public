<p>&ldquo;Girl&rdquo; （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>IN GILT letters on the ground glass of the door of room No. 962 were the words:
&ldquo;Robbins &amp; Hartley, Brokers.&rdquo; The clerks had gone. It was past five, and with the solid tramp
of a drove of prize Percherons, scrub- women were invading the cloud-capped twenty-story
office building. A puff of red-hot air flavoured with lemon peelings, soft-coal smoke and train
oil came in through the half-open windows.
Robbins, fifty, something of an overweight beau, and addicted to first nights and hotel
palm-rooms, pretended to be envious of his partner&rsquo;s commuter&rsquo;s joys.
&ldquo;Going to be something doing in the humidity line to-night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You out-of-town
chaps will be the people, with your katydids and moonlight and long drinks and things out
on the front porch.&rdquo;
Hartley, twenty-nine, serious, thin, good-looking, ner- vous, sighed and frowned a little.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we always have cool nights in Floral- hurst, especially in the winter.&rdquo;
A man with an air of mystery came in the door and went up to Hartley.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found where she lives,&rdquo; he announced in the portentous half-whisper that makes
the detective at work a marked being to his fellow men.
Hartley scowled him into a state of dramatic silence and quietude. But by that time
Robbins had got his cane and set his tie pin to his liking, and with a debonair nod went out
to his metropolitan amusements.
&ldquo;Here is the address,&rdquo; said the detective in a natural tone, being deprived of an
audience to foil.
Hartley took the leaf torn out of the sleuth&rsquo;s dingy memorandum book. On it were
pencilled the words &ldquo;Vivienne Arlington, No. 341 East &ndash;th Street, care of Mrs. McComus.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Moved there a week ago,&rdquo; said the detective. &ldquo;Now, if you want any shadowing done,
Mr. Hartley, I can do you as fine a job in that line as anybody in the city. It will be only $7 a
day and expenses. Can send in a daily typewritten report, covering &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t go on,&rdquo; interrupted the broker. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a case of that kind. I merely
wanted the address. How much shall I pay you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;One day&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; said the sleuth. &ldquo;A tenner will cover it.&ldquo;Hartley paid the man and dismissed him. Then he left the office and boarded a
Broadway car. At the first large crosstown artery of travel he took an eastbound car that
deposited him in a decaying avenue, whose ancient structures once sheltered the pride and
glory of the town.
Walking a few squares, he came to the building that he sought. It was a new flathouse,
bearing carved upon its cheap stone portal its sonorous name, &ldquo;The Vallambrosa.&rdquo;
Fire-escapes zigzagged down its front &ndash; these laden with household goods, drying clothes,
and squalling children evicted by the midsummer heat. Here and there a pale rubber plant
peeped from the miscellaneous mass, as if wondering to what kingdom it belonged &ndash;
vegetable, animal or artificial.
Hartley pressed the &ldquo;McComus&rdquo; button. The door latch clicked spasmodically &ndash; now
hospitably, now doubt- fully, as though in anxiety whether it might be admitting friends or
duns. Hartley entered and began to climb the stairs after the manner of those who seek
their friends in city flat-houses &ndash; which is the manner of a boy who climbs an apple-tree,
stopping when he comes upon what he wants.
On the fourth floor he saw Vivienne standing in an open door. She invited him inside,
with a nod and a bright, genuine smile. She placed a chair for him near a window, and
poised herself gracefully upon the edge of one of those Jekyll-and-Hyde pieces of furniture
that are masked and mysteriously hooded, unguessable bulks by day and inquisitorial racks
of torture by night.
Hartley cast a quick, critical, appreciative glance at her before speaking, and told
himself that his taste in choosing had been flawless.
Vivienne was about twenty-one. She was of the purest Saxon type. Her hair was a
ruddy golden, each filament of the neatly gathered mass shining with its own lustre and
delicate graduation of colour. In perfect harmony were her ivory-clear complexion and deep
sea-blue eyes that looked upon the world with the ingenuous calmness of a mermaid or the
pixie of an undiscovered mountain stream. Her frame was strong and yet possessed the
grace of absolute naturalness. And yet with all her North- ern clearness and frankness of line
and colouring, there seemed to be something of the tropics in her &ndash; something of languor in
the droop of her pose, of love of ease in her ingenious complacency of satisfaction and
comfort in the mere act of breathing &ndash; something that seemed to claim for her a right as a
perfect work of nature to exist and be admired equally with a rare flower or some beauti- ful,
milk-white dove among its sober-hued companions.
She was dressed in a white waist and dark skirt - that discreet masquerade of goose-girl
and duchess.
&ldquo;Vivienne,&rdquo; said Hartley, looking at her pleadingly, &ldquo;you did not answer my last letter. It
was only by nearly a week&rsquo;s search that I found where you had moved to. Why have youkept me in suspense when you knew how anxiously I was waiting to see you and hear from
you?&rdquo;
The girl looked out the window dreamily.
&ldquo;Mr. Hartley,&rdquo; she said hesitatingly, &ldquo;I hardly know what to say to you. I realize all the
advantages of your offer, and sometimes I feel sure that I could be contented with you. But,
again, I am doubtful. I was born a city girl, and I am afraid to bind myself to a quiet suburban life.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; said Hartley, ardently, &ldquo;have I not told you that you shall have everything
that your heart can desire that is in my power to give you? You shall come to the city for the
theatres, for shopping and to visit your friends as often as you care to. You can trust me, can
you not?&rdquo;
&ldquo;To the fullest,&rdquo; she said, turning her frank eyes upon him with a smile. &ldquo;I know you are
the kindest of men, and that the girl you get will be a lucky one. I learned all about you when
I was at the Montgomerys&rsquo;.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Hartley, with a tender, reminiscent light in his eye; &ldquo;I remember well
the evening I first saw you at the Montgomerys&rsquo;. Mrs. Montgomery was sound- ing your
praises to me all the evening. And she hardly did you justice. I shall never forget that supper.
Come, Vivienne, promise me. I want you. You&rsquo;ll never regret coming with me. No one else
will ever give you as pleasant a home.&rdquo;
The girl sighed and looked down at her folded hands.
A sudden jealous suspicion seized Hartley.
&ldquo;Tell me, Vivienne,&rdquo; he asked, regarding her keenly, &ldquo;is there another &ndash; is there some
one else ?&rdquo;
A rosy flush crept slowly over her fair cheeks and neck.
&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t ask that, Mr. Hartley,&rdquo; she said, in some confusion. &ldquo;But I will tell you.
There is one other &ndash; but he has no right &ndash; I have promised him nothing.&rdquo;
&ldquo;His name?&rdquo; demanded Hartley, sternly.
&ldquo;Townsend.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Rafford Townsend!&rdquo; exclaimed Hartley, with a grim tightening of his jaw. &ldquo;How did that
man come to know you? After all I&rsquo;ve done for him &ndash; &ldquo;&ldquo;His auto has just stopped below,&rdquo; said Vivienne, bending over the window-sill. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
coming for his answer. Oh I don&rsquo;t know what to do!&rdquo;
The bell in the flat kitchen whirred. Vivienne hurried to press the latch button.
&ldquo;Stay here,&rdquo; said Hartley. &ldquo;I will meet him in the hall.&rdquo;
Townsend, looking like a Spanish grandee in his light tweeds, Panama hat and curling
black mustache, came up the stairs three at a time. He stopped at sight of Hartley and
looked foolish.
&ldquo;Go back,&rdquo; said Hartley, firmly, pointing downstairs with his forefinger.
&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Townsend, feigning surprise. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? What are you doing here, old
man?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Go back,&rdquo; repeated Hartley, inflexibly. &ldquo;The Law of the Jungle. Do you want the Pack to
tear you in pieces? The kill is mine.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I came here to see a plumber about the bathroom connections,&rdquo; said Townsend,
bravely.
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Hartley. &ldquo;You shall have that lying plaster to stick upon your traitorous
soul. But, go back.&rdquo; Townsend went downstairs, leaving a bitter word to be wafted up the
draught of the staircase. Hartley went back to his wooing.
&ldquo;Vivienne,&rdquo; said he, masterfully. &ldquo;I have got to have you. I will take no more refusals or
dilly-dallying.&rdquo;
&ldquo;When do you want me?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;Now. As soon as you can get ready.&rdquo;
She stood calmly before him and looked him in the eye.
&ldquo;Do you think for one moment,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I would enter your home while Héloise
is there?&rdquo;
Hartley cringed as if from an unexpected blow. He folded his arms and paced the carpet
once or twice.
&ldquo;She shall go,&rdquo; he declared grimly. Drops stood upon his brow. &ldquo;Why should I let that
woman make my life miserable? Never have I seen one day of freedom from trouble since Ihave known her. You are right, Vivienne. Héloise must be sent away before I can take you
home. But she shall go. I have decided. I will turn her from my doors.&rdquo;
&ldquo;When will you do this?&rdquo; asked the girl.
Hartley clinched his teeth and bent his brows together.
&ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; he said, resolutely. &ldquo;I will send her away to-night.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Vivienne, &ldquo;my answer is &lsquo;yes.&rsquo; Come for me when you will.&rdquo;
She looked into his eyes with a sweet, sincere light in her own. Hartley could scarcely
believe that her sur- render was true, it was so swift and complete.
&ldquo;Promise me,&rdquo; he said feelingly, &ldquo;on your word and honour.&rdquo;
&ldquo;On my word and honour,&rdquo; repeated Vivienne, softly.
At the door he turned and gazed at her happily, but yet as one who scarcely trusts the
foundations of his joy.
&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he said, with a forefinger of reminder uplifted.
&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she repeated with a smile of truth and candour.
In an hour and forty minutes Hartley stepped off the train at Floralhurst. A brisk walk of
ten minutes brought him to the gate of a handsome two-story cottage set upon a wide and
well-tended lawn. Halfway to the house he was met by a woman with jet-black braided hair
and flowing white summer gown, who half strangled him without apparent cause.
When they stepped into the hall she said:
&ldquo;Mamma&rsquo;s here. The auto is coming for her in half an hour. She came to dinner, but
there&rsquo;s no dinner.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something to tell you,&rdquo; said Hartley. &ldquo;I thought to break it to you gently, but since
your mother is here we may as well out with it.&rdquo;
He stooped and whispered something at her ear.
His wife screamed. Her mother came running into the hall. The dark-haired woman
screamed again- the joyful scream of a well-beloved and petted woman.&ldquo;Oh, mamma!&rdquo; she cried ecstatically, &ldquo;what do you think? Vivienne is coming to cook
for us! She is the one that stayed with the Montgomerys a whole year. And now, Billy, dear,&rdquo;
she concluded, &ldquo;you must go right down into the kitchen and discharge Héloise. She has
been drunk again the whole day long.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What You Want&rdquo; （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Night had fallen on that great and beautiful city known as Bagdad-on-the-Subway. And
with the night came the enchanted glamour that belongs not to Arabia alone. In different
masquerade the streets, bazaars and walled houses of the occidental city of romance were
filled with the same kind of folk that so much interested our interesting old friend, the late
Mr. H. A. Rashid. They wore clothes eleven hundred years nearer to the latest styles than H.
A. saw in old Bagdad; but they were about the same people underneath. With the eye of
faith, you could have seen the Little Hunchback, Sinbad the Sailor, Fitbad the Tailor, the
Beautiful Persian, the one-eyed Calenders, Ali Baba and Forty Robbers on every block, and
the Barber and his Six Brothers, and all the old Arabian gang easily.
But let us revenue to our lamb chops.
Old Tom Crowley was a caliph. He had $42,000,000 in preferred stocks and bonds with
solid gold edges. In these times, to be called a caliph you must have money. The old-style
caliph business as conducted by Mr. Rashid is not safe. If you hold up a person nowadays in a
bazaar or a Turkish bath or a side street, and inquire into his private and personal affairs, the
police court&rsquo;ll get you.
Old Tom was tired of clubs, theatres, dinners, friends, music, money and everything.
That&rsquo;s what makes a caliph - you must get to despise everything that money can buy, and
then go out and try to want something that you can&rsquo;t pay for.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a little trot around town all by myself,&rdquo; thought old Tom, &ldquo;and try if I can stir up
anything new. Let&rsquo;s see - it seems I&rsquo;ve read about a king or a Cardiff giant or something in old
times who used to go about with false whiskers on, making Persian dates with folks he
hadn&rsquo;t been introduced to. That don&rsquo;t listen like a bad idea. I certainly have got a case of
humdrumness and fatigue on for the ones I do know. That old Cardiff used to pick up cases
of trouble as he ran upon &lsquo;em and give &lsquo;em gold - sequins, I think it was - and make &lsquo;emmarry or got &lsquo;em good Government jobs. Now, I&rsquo;d like something of that sort. My money is
as good as his was even if the magazines do ask me every month where I got it. Yes, I guess
I&rsquo;ll do a little Cardiff business to-night, and see how it goes.&rdquo;
Plainly dressed, old Tom Crowley left his Madison Avenue palace, and walked westward
and then south. As he stepped to the sidewalk, Fate, who holds the ends of the strings in the
central offices of all the enchanted cities pulled a thread, and a young man twenty blocks
away looked at a wall clock, and then put on his coat.
James Turner worked in one of those little hat-cleaning establishments on Sixth Avenue
in which a fire alarms rings when you push the door open, and where they clean your hat
while you wait - two days. James stood all day at an electric machine that turned hats
around faster than the best brands of champagne ever could have done. Overlooking your
mild impertinence in feeling a curiosity about the personal appearance of a stranger, I will
give you a modified description of him. Weight, 118; complexion, hair and brain, light; height,
five feet six; age, about twenty-three; dressed in a $10 suit of greenish-blue serge; pockets
containing two keys and sixty-three cents in change.
But do not misconjecture because this description sounds like a General Alarm that
James was either lost or a dead one.
Allons!
James stood all day at his work. His feet were tender and extremely susceptible to
impositions being put upon or below them. All day long they burned and smarted, causing
him much suffering and inconvenience. But he was earning twelve dollars per week, which
he needed to support his feet whether his feet would support him or not.
James Turner had his own conception of what happiness was, just as you and I have
ours. Your delight is to gad about the world in yachts and motor-cars and to hurl ducats at
wild fowl. Mine is to smoke a pipe at evenfall and watch a badger, a rattlesnake, and an owl
go into their common prairie home one by one.
James Turner&rsquo;s idea of bliss was different; but it was his. He would go directly to his
boarding-house when his day&rsquo;s work was done. After his supper of small steak, Bessemer
potatoes, stooed (not stewed) apples and infusion of chicory, he would ascend to his
fifth-floor-back hall room. Then he would take off his shoes and socks, place the soles of his
burning feet against the cold bars of his iron bed, and read Clark Russell&rsquo;s sea yarns. The
delicious relief of the cool metal applied to his smarting soles was his nightly joy. His favorite
novels never palled upon him; the sea and the adventures of its navigators were his sole
intellectual passion. No millionaire was ever happier than James Turner taking his ease.When James left the hat-cleaning shop he walked three blocks out of his way home to
look over the goods of a second-hand bookstall. On the sidewalk stands he had more than
once picked up a paper-covered volume of Clark Russell at half price.
While he was bending with a scholarly stoop over the marked-down miscellany of
cast-off literature, old Tom the caliph sauntered by. His discerning eye, made keen by twenty
years&rsquo; experience in the manufacture of laundry soap (save the wrappers!) recognized
instantly the poor and discerning scholar, a worthy object of his caliphanous mood. He
descended the two shallow stone steps that led from the sidewalk, and addressed without
hesitation the object of his designed munificence. His first words were no worse than
salutatory and tentative.
James Turner looked up coldly, with &ldquo;Sartor Resartus&rdquo; in one hand and &ldquo;A Mad
Marriage&rdquo; in the other.
&ldquo;Beat it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to buy any coat hangers or town lots in Hankipoo, New
Jersey. Run along, now, and play with your Teddy bear.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the caliph, ignoring the flippancy of the hat cleaner, &ldquo;I observe that
you are of a studious disposition. Learning is one of the finest things in the world. I never
had any of it worth mentioning, but I admire to see it in others. I come from the West,
where we imagine nothing but facts. Maybe I couldn&rsquo;t understand the poetry and allusions
in them books you are picking over, but I like to see somebody else seem to know what they
mean. I&rsquo;m worth about $40,000,000, and I&rsquo;m getting richer every day. I made the height of it
manufacturing Aunt Patty&rsquo;s Silver Soap. I invented the art of making it. I experimented for
three years before I got just the right quantity of chloride of sodium solution and caustic
potash mixture to curdle properly. And after I had taken some $9,000,000 out of the soap
business I made the rest in corn and wheat futures. Now, you seem to have the literary and
scholarly turn of character; and I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll pay for your education at the
finest college in the world. I&rsquo;ll pay the expense of your rummaging over Europe and the art
galleries, and finally set you up in a good business. You needn&rsquo;t make it soap if you have any
objections. I see by your clothes and frazzled necktie that you are mighty poor; and you can&rsquo;t
afford to turn down the offer. Well, when do you want to begin?&rdquo;
The hat cleaner turned upon old Tom the eye of the Big City, which is an eye expressive
of cold and justifiable suspicion, of judgment suspended as high as Haman was hung, of
self-preservation, of challenge, curiosity, defiance, cynicism, and, strange as you may think it,
of a childlike yearning for friendliness and fellowship that must be hidden when one walks
among the &ldquo;stranger bands.&rdquo; For in New Bagdad one, in order to survive, must suspect
whosoever sits, dwells, drinks, rides, walks or sleeps in the adjacent chair, house, booth, seat,
path or room.
&ldquo;Say, Mike,&rdquo; said James Turner, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your line, anyway - shoe laces? I&rsquo;m not buying
anything. You better put an egg in your shoe and beat it before incidents occur to you. Youcan&rsquo;t work off any fountain pens, gold spectacles you found on the street, or trust company
certificate house clearings on me. Say, do I look like I&rsquo;d climbed down one of them missing
fire-escapes at Helicon Hall? What&rsquo;s vitiating you, anyhow?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Son,&rdquo; said the caliph, in his most Harunish tones, &ldquo;as I said, I&rsquo;m worth $40,000,000. I
don&rsquo;t want to have it all put in my coffin when I die. I want to do some good with it. I seen
you handling over these here volumes of literature, and I thought I&rsquo;d keep you. I&rsquo;ve give the
missionary societies $2,000,000, but what did I get out of it? Nothing but a receipt from the
secretary. Now, you are just the kind of young man I&rsquo;d like to take up and see what money
could make of him.&rdquo;
Volumes of Clark Russell were hard to find that evening at the Old Book Shop. And
James Turner&rsquo;s smarting and aching feet did not tend to improve his temper. Humble hat
cleaner though he was, he had a spirit equal to any caliph&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Say, you old faker,&rdquo; he said, angrily, &ldquo;be on your way. I don&rsquo;t know what your game is,
unless you want change for a bogus $40,000,000 bill. Well, I don&rsquo;t carry that much around
with me. But I do carry a pretty fair left-handed punch that you&rsquo;ll get if you don&rsquo;t move on.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You are a blamed impudent little gutter pup,&rdquo; said the caliph.
Then James delivered his self-praised punch; old Tom seized him by the collar and
kicked him thrice; the hat cleaner rallied and clinched; two bookstands were overturned,
and the books sent flying. A copy came up, took an arm of each, and marched them to the
nearest station house. &ldquo;Fighting and disorderly conduct,&rdquo; said the cop to the sergeant.
&ldquo;Three hundred dollars bail,&rdquo; said the sergeant at once, asseveratingly and inquiringly.
&ldquo;Sixty-three cents,&rdquo; said James Turner with a harsh laugh.
The caliph searched his pockets and collected small bills and change amounting to four
dollars.
&ldquo;I am worth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;forty million dollars, but -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lock &lsquo;em up,&rdquo; ordered the sergeant.
In his cell, James Turner laid himself on his cot, ruminating. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s got the money,
and maybe he ain&rsquo;t. But if he has or he ain&rsquo;t, what does he want to go &lsquo;round butting into
other folks&rsquo;s business for? When a man knows what he wants, and can get it, it&rsquo;s the same as
$40,000,000 to him.&rdquo;
Then an idea came to him that brought a pleased look to his face.He removed his socks, drew his cot close to the door, stretched himself out luxuriously,
and placed his tortured feet against the cold bars of the cell door. Something hard and bulky
under the blankets of his cot gave one shoulder discomfort. He reached under, and drew out
a paper-covered volume by Clark Russell called &ldquo;A Sailor&rsquo;s Sweetheart.&rdquo; He gave a great sigh
of contentment.
Presently, to his cell came the doorman and said:
&ldquo;Say, kid, that old gazabo that was pinched with you for scrapping seems to have been
the goods after all. He &lsquo;phoned to his friends, and he&rsquo;s out at the desk now with a roll of
yellowbacks as big as a Pullman car pillow. He wants to bail you, and for you to come out
and see him.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tell him I ain&rsquo;t in,&rdquo; said James Turner.
An Adjustment of Nature （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>In an art exhibition the other day I saw a painting that had been sold for $5,000. The
painter was a young scrub out of the West named Kraft, who had a favourite food and a pet
theory. His pabulum was an unquenchable belief in the Unerring Artistic Adjustment of
Nature. His theory was fixed around corned-beef hash with poached egg. There was a story
behind the picture, so I went home and let it drip out of a fountain-pen. The idea of
Kraft&ndash;but that is not the beginning of the story.
Three years ago Kraft, Bill Judkins (a poet), and I took our meals at Cypher&rsquo;s, on Eighth
Avenue. I say &ldquo;took.&rdquo; When we had money, Cypher got it &ldquo;off of&rdquo; us, as he expressed it. We
had no credit; we went in, called for food and ate it. We paid or we did not pay. We had
confidence in Cypher&rsquo;s sullenness end smouldering ferocity. Deep down in his sunless soul
he was either a prince, a fool or an artist. He sat at a worm-eaten desk, covered with files of
waiters&rsquo; checks so old that I was sure the bottomest one was for clams that Hendrik Hudson
had eaten and paid for. Cypher had the power, in common with Napoleon III. and the
goggle-eyed perch, of throwing a film over his eyes, rendering opaque the windows of his
soul. Once when we left him unpaid, with egregious excuses, I looked back and saw him
shaking with inaudible laughter behind his film. Now and then we paid up back scores.
But the chief thing at Cypher&rsquo;s was Milly. Milly was a waitress. She was a grand example
of Kraft&rsquo;s theory of the artistic adjustment of nature. She belonged, largely, to waiting, asMinerva did to the art of scrapping, or Venus to the science of serious flirtation. Pedestalled
and in bronze she might have stood with the noblest of her heroic sisters as
&ldquo;Liver-and-Bacon Enlivening the World.&rdquo; She belonged to Cypher&rsquo;s. You expected to see her
colossal figure loom through that reeking blue cloud of smoke from frying fat just as you
expect the Palisades to appear through a drifting Hudson River fog. There amid the steam of
vegetables and the vapours of acres of &ldquo;ham and,&rdquo; the crash of crockery, the clatter of steel,
the screaming of &ldquo;short orders,&rdquo; the cries of the hungering and all the horrid tumult of
feeding man, surrounded by swarms of the buzzing winged beasts bequeathed us by
Pharaoh, Milly steered her magnificent way like some great liner cleaving among the canoes
of howling savages.
Our Goddess of Grub was built on lines so majestic that they could be followed only
with awe. Her sleeves were always rolled above her elbows. She could have taken us three
musketeers in her two hands and dropped us out of the window. She had seen fewer years
than any of us, but she was of such superb Evehood and simplicity that she mothered us
from the beginning. Cypher&rsquo;s store of eatables she poured out upon us with royal
indifference to price and quantity, as from a cornucopia that knew no exhaustion. Her voice
rang like a great silver bell; her smile was many-toothed and frequent; she seemed like a
yellow sunrise on mountain tops. I never saw her but I thought of the Yosemite. And yet,
somehow, I could never think of her as existing outside of Cypher&rsquo;s. There nature had placed
her, and she had taken root and grown mightily. She seemed happy, and took her few poor
dollars on Saturday nights with the flushed pleasure of a child that receives an unexpected
donation.
It was Kraft who first voiced the fear that each of us must have held latently. It came up
apropos, of course, of certain questions of art at which we were hammering. One of us
compared the harmony existing between a Haydn symphony and pistache ice cream to the
exquisite congruity between Milly and Cypher&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;There is a certain fate hanging over Milly,&rdquo; said Kraft, &ldquo;and if it overtakes her she is lost
to Cypher&rsquo;s and to us.&rdquo;
&ldquo;She will grow fat? &ldquo;asked Judkins, fearsomely.
&ldquo;She will go to night school and become refined?&rdquo; I ventured anxiously.
&ldquo;It is this,&rdquo; said Kraft, punctuating in a puddle of spilled coffee with a stiff forefinger.
&ldquo;Caesar had his Brutus&ndash;the cotton has its boliworm, the chorus girl has her Pittsburger, the
summer boarder has his poison ivy, the hero has his Carnegie medal, art has its Morgan, the
rose has its&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; I interrupted, much perturbed. &ldquo;You do not think that Milly will begin to lace?&rdquo;&ldquo;One day,&rdquo; concluded Kraft, solemnly, &ldquo;there will come to Cypher&rsquo;s for a plate of beans
a millionaire lumberman from Wisconsin, and he will marry Milly.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; exclaimed Judkins and T, in horror.
&ldquo;A lumberman,&rdquo; repeated Kraft, hoarsely.
&ldquo;And a millionaire lumberman!&rdquo; I sighed, despairingly.
&ldquo;From Wisconsin!&rdquo; groaned Judkins.
We agreed that the awful fate seemed to menace her. Few things were less improbable.
Milly, like some vast virgin stretch of pine woods, was made to catch the lumberman&rsquo;s eye.
And well we knew the habits of the Badgers, once fortune smiled upon them. Straight to
New York they hie, and lay their goods at the feet of the girl who serves them beans in a
beanery. Why, the alphabet itself connives. The Sunday newspaper&rsquo;s headliner&rsquo;s work is cut
for him.
&ldquo;Winsome Waitress Wins Wealthy Wisconsin Woodsman.
For a while we felt that Milly was on the verge of being lost to us.
It was our love of the Unerring Artistic Adjustment of Nature that inspired us. We could
not give her over to a lumberman, doubly accursed by wealth and provincialism. We
shuddered to think of Milly, with her voice modulated and her elbows covered, pouring tea
in the marble teepee of a tree murderer. No! In Cypher&rsquo;s she belonged&ndash;in the bacon smoke,
the cabbage perfume, the grand, Wagnerian chorus of hurled ironstone china and rattling
casters.
Our fears must have been prophetic, for on that same evening the wildwood
discharged upon us Milly&rsquo;s preordained confiscator&ndash;our fee to adjustment and order. But
Alaska and not Wisconsin bore the burden of the visitation.
We were at our supper of beef stew and dried apples when he trotted in as if on the
heels of a dog team, and made one of the mess at our table. With the freedom of the camps
he assaulted our ears and claimed the fellowship of men lost in the wilds of a hash house.
We embraced him as a specimen, and in three minutes we had all but died for one another
as friends.
He was rugged and bearded and wind-dried. He had just come off the &ldquo;trail,&rdquo; he said, at
one of the North River ferries. I fancied I could see the snow dust of Chilcoot yet powdering
his shoulders. And then he strewed the table with the nuggets, stuffed ptarmigans, bead
work and seal pelts of the returned Kiondiker, and began to prate to us of his millions.&ldquo;Bank drafts for two millions,&rdquo; was his summing up, &ldquo;and a thousand a day piling up
from my claims. And now I want some beef stew and canned peaches. I never got off the
train since I mushed out of Seattle, and I&rsquo;m hungry. The stuff the niggers feed you on
Pullmans don&rsquo;t count. You gentlemen order what you want.&rdquo;
And then Milly loomed up with a thousand dishes on her bare arm&ndash; loomed up big and
white and pink and awful as Mount Saint Elias&ndash;with a smile like day breaking in a gulch. And
the Kiondiker threw down his pelts and nuggets as dross, and let his jaw fall half-way, and
stared at her. You could almost see the diamond tiaras on Milly&rsquo;s brow and the
hand-embroidered silk Paris gowns that he meant to buy for her.
At last the bollworm had attacked the cotton&ndash;the poison ivy was reaching out its
tendrils to entwine the summer boarder&ndash;the millionaire lumberman, thinly disguised as the
Alaskan miner, was about to engulf our Milly and upset Nature&rsquo;s adjustment.
Kraft was the first to act. He leaped up and pounded the Klondiker&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;Come out
and drink,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Drink first and eat afterward.&rdquo; Judkins seized one arm and I the
other. Gaily, roaringly, irresistibly, in jolly-good-fellow style, we dragged him from the
restaurant to a cafe, stuffing his pockets with his embalmed birds and indigestible nuggets.
There he rumbled a roughly good-humoured protest. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the girl for my money,&rdquo; he
declared. &ldquo;She can eat out of my skillet the rest of her life. Why, I never see such a fine girl.
I&rsquo;m going back there and ask her to marry me. I guess she won&rsquo;t want to sling hash any more
when she sees the pile of dust I&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take another whiskey and milk now,&rdquo; Kraft persuaded, with Satan&rsquo;s smile. &ldquo;I
thought you up-country fellows were better sports.&rdquo;
Kraft spent his puny store of coin at the bar and then gave Judkins and me such an
appealing look that we went down to the last dime we had in toasting our guest.
Then, when our ammunition was gone and the Klondiker, still somewhat sober, began
to babble again of Milly, Kraft whispered into his ear such a polite, barbed insult relating to
people who were miserly with their funds, that the miner crashed down handful after
handful of silver and notes, calling for all the fluids in the world to drown the imputation.
Thus the work was accomplished. With his own guns we drove him from the field. And
then we had him carted to a distant small hotel and put to bed with his nuggets and baby
seal-skins stuffed around him.
&ldquo;He will never find Cypher&rsquo;s again,&rdquo; said Kraft. &ldquo;He will propose to the first white apron
he sees in a dairy restaurant to-morrow. And Milly&ndash;I mean the Natural Adjustment&ndash;is
saved!&ldquo;And back to Cypher&rsquo;s went we three, and, finding customers scarce, we joined hands
and did an Indian dance with Milly in the centre.
This, I say, happened three years ago. And about that time a little luck descended upon
us three, and we were enabled to buy costlier and less wholesome food than Cypher&rsquo;s. Our
paths separated, and I saw Kraft no more and Judkins seldom.
But, as I said, I saw a painting the other day that was sold for $5,000. The title was
&ldquo;Boadicea,&rdquo; and the figure seemed to fill all out-of-doors. But of all the picture&rsquo;s admirers
who stood before it, I believe I was the only one who longed for Boadicea to stalk from her
frame, bringing me corned-beef hash with poached egg.
I hurried away to see Kraft. His satanic eyes were the same, his hair was worse tangled,
but his clothes had been made by a tailor.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said to him.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve bought a cottage in the Bronx with the money,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Any evening at 7.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;when you led us against the lumberman&ndash;the&ndash; Klondiker&ndash;it wasn&rsquo;t
altogether on account of the Unerring Artistic Adjustment of Nature?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, not altogether,&rdquo; said Kraft, with a grin.
After Twenty Years （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively. The impressiveness was
habitual and not for show, for spectators were few. The time was barely 10 o&rsquo;clock at night,
but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them had well nigh depeopled the streets.
Trying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements,
turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown the pacific thoroughfare, the officer,
with his stalwart form and slight swagger, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace.
The vicinity was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the lights of a cigar
store or of an all-night lunch counter; but the majority of the doors belonged to business
places that had long since been closed.
When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk. In the
doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth.
As the policeman walked up to him the man spoke up quickly.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, officer,&rdquo; he said, reassuringly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just waiting for a friend. It&rsquo;s an
appointment made twenty years ago. Sounds a little funny to you, doesn&rsquo;t it? Well, I&rsquo;ll
explain if you&rsquo;d like to make certain it&rsquo;s all straight. About that long ago there used to be a
restaurant where this store stands&ndash;&lsquo;Big Joe&rsquo; Brady&rsquo;s restaurant.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Until five years ago,&rdquo; said the policeman. &ldquo;It was torn down then.&rdquo;
The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light showed a pale,
square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white scar near his right eyebrow. His scarfpin
was a large diamond, oddly set.
&ldquo;Twenty years ago to-night,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I dined here at &lsquo;Big Joe&rsquo; Brady&rsquo;s with Jimmy
Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the world. He and I were raised here in New
York, just like two brothers, together. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next
morning I was to start for the West to make my fortune. You couldn&rsquo;t have dragged Jimmy
out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. Well, we agreed that night that
we would meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time, no matter what
our conditions might be or from what distance we might have to come. We figured that in
twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made,
whatever they were going to be.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It sounds pretty interesting,&rdquo; said the policeman. &ldquo;Rather a long time between meets,
though, it seems to me. Haven&rsquo;t you heard from your friend since you left?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, yes, for a time we corresponded,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;But after a year or two we lost
track of each other. You see, the West is a pretty big proposition, and I kept hustling around
over it pretty lively. But I know Jimmy will meet me here if he&rsquo;s alive, for he always was the
truest, stanchest old chap in the world. He&rsquo;ll never forget. I came a thousand miles to stand
in this door to-night, and it&rsquo;s worth it if my old partner turns up.&rdquo;
The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with small diamonds.
&ldquo;Three minutes to ten,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;It was exactly ten o&rsquo;clock when we parted here
at the restaurant door.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Did pretty well out West, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked the policeman.
&ldquo;You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half as well. He was a kind of plodder, though, good
fellow as he was. I&rsquo;ve had to compete with some of the sharpest wits going to get my pile. A
man gets in a groove in New York. It takes the West to put a razor-edge on him.&rdquo;
The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on my way. Hope your friend comes around all right. Going to call time on him
sharp?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him half an hour at least. If Jimmy is alive on
earth he&rsquo;ll be here by that time. So long, officer.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Good-night, sir,&rdquo; said the policeman, passing on along his beat, trying doors as he
went.
There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from its uncertain
puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers astir in that quarter hurried dismally and
silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed hands. And in the door of the
hardware store the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment, uncertain
almost to absurdity, with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and waited.
About twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long overcoat, with collar
turned up to his ears, hurried across from the opposite side of the street. He went directly to
the waiting man.
&ldquo;Is that you, Bob?&rdquo; he asked, doubtfully.
&ldquo;Is that you, Jimmy Wells?&rdquo; cried the man in the door.
&ldquo;Bless my heart!&rdquo; exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other&rsquo;s hands with his
own. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bob, sure as fate. I was certain I&rsquo;d find you here if you were still in existence. Well,
well, well! &ndash;twenty years is a long time. The old gone, Bob; I wish it had lasted, so we could
have had another dinner there. How has the West treated you, old man?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bully; it has given me everything I asked it for. You&rsquo;ve changed lots, Jimmy. I never
thought you were so tall by two or three inches.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, I grew a bit after I was twenty.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Doing well in New York, Jimmy?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Moderately. I have a position in one of the city departments. Come on, Bob; we&rsquo;ll go
around to a place I know of, and have a good long talk about old times.&rdquo;
The two men started up the street, arm in arm. The man from the West, his egotism
enlarged by success, was beginning to outline the history of his career. The other, submerged
in his overcoat, listened with interest.
At the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights. When they came into this
glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the other&rsquo;s face.The man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Jimmy Wells,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Twenty years is a long time, but not long
enough to change a man&rsquo;s nose from a Roman to a pug.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one, said the tall man. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been
under arrest for ten minutes, &lsquo;Silky&rsquo; Bob. Chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way
and wires us she wants to have a chat with you. Going quietly, are you? That&rsquo;s sensible. Now,
before we go on to the station here&rsquo;s a note I was asked to hand you. You may read it here at
the window. It&rsquo;s from Patrolman Wells.&rdquo;
The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him. His hand was
steady when he began to read, but it trembled a little by the time he had finished. The note
was rather short.
&ldquo;Bob: I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the match to light your
cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in Chicago. Somehow I couldn&rsquo;t do it myself, so
I went around and got a plain clothes man to do the job. JIMMY.&rdquo;
An Afternoon Miracle （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>At the United States end of an international river bridge, four armed rangers sweltered
in a little &lsquo;dobe hut, keeping a fairly faithful espionage upon the lagging trail of passengers
from the Mexican side.
Bud Dawson, proprietor of the Top Notch Saloon, had, on the evening previous,
violently ejected from his premises one Leandro Garcia, for alleged violation of the Top
Notch code of behaviour. Garcia had mentioned twenty-four hours as a limit, by which time
he would call and collect a painful indemnity for personal satisfaction.
This Mexican, although a tremendous braggart, was thoroughly courageous, and each
side of the river respected him for one of these attributes. He and a following of similar
bravoes were addicted to the pastime of retrieving towns from stagnation.
The day designated by Garcia for retribution was to be further signalised on the
American side by a cattlemen&rsquo;s convention, a bull fight, and an old settlers&rsquo; barbecue and
picnic. Knowing the avenger to be a man of his word, and believing it prudent to court peacewhile three such gently social relaxations were in progress, Captain McNulty, of the ranger
company stationed there, detailed his lieutenant and three men for duty at the end of the
bridge. Their instructions were to prevent the invasion of Garcia, either alone or attended by
his gang.
Travel was slight that sultry afternoon, and the rangers swore gently, and mopped their
brows in their convenient but close quarters. For an hour no one had crossed save an old
woman enveloped in a brown wrapper and a black mantilla, driving before her a burro
loaded with kindling wood tied in small bundles for peddling. Then three shots were fired
down the street, the sound coming clear and snappy through the still air.
The four rangers quickened from sprawling, symbolic figures of indolence to alert life,
but only one rose to his feet. Three turned their eyes beseechingly but hopelessly upon the
fourth, who had gotten nimbly up and was buckling his cartridge-belt around him. The three
knew that Lieutenant Bob Buckley, in command, would allow no man of them the privilege
of investigating a row when he himself might go.
The agile, broad-chested lieutenant, without a change of expression in his smooth,
yellow-brown, melancholy face, shot the belt strap through the guard of the buckle, hefted
his sixes in their holsters as a belle gives the finishing touches to her toilette, caught up his
Winchester, and dived for the door. There he paused long enough to caution his comrades to
maintain their watch upon the bridge, and then plunged into the broiling highway.
The three relapsed into resigned inertia and plaintive comment.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of fellows,&rdquo; grumbled Broncho Leathers, &ldquo;what was wedded to danger, but if
Bob Buckley ain&rsquo;t committed bigamy with trouble, I&rsquo;m a son of a gun.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Peculiarness of Bob is,&rdquo; inserted the Nueces Kid, &ldquo;he ain&rsquo;t had proper trainin&rsquo;. He never
learned how to git skeered. Now, a man ought to be skeered enough when he tackles a fuss
to hanker after readin&rsquo; his name on the list of survivors, anyway.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Buckley,&rdquo; commented Ranger No. 3, who was a misguided Eastern man, burdened with
an education, &ldquo;scraps in such a solemn manner that I have been led to doubt its spontaneity.
I&rsquo;m not quite onto his system, but he fights, like Tybalt, by the book of arithmetic.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I never heard,&rdquo; mentioned Broncho, &ldquo;about any of Dibble&rsquo;s ways of mixin&rsquo; scrappin&rsquo;
and cipherin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Triggernometry?&rdquo; suggested the Nueces infant.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather better than I hoped from you,&rdquo; nodded the Easterner, approvingly. &ldquo;The
other meaning is that Buckley never goes into a fight without giving away weight. He seems
to dread taking the slightest advantage. That&rsquo;s quite close to foolhardiness when you aredealing with horse-thieves and fence-cutters who would ambush you any night, and shoot
you in the back if they could. Buckley&rsquo;s too full of sand. He&rsquo;ll play Horatius and hold the
bridge once too often some day.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on there,&rdquo; drawled the Kid; &ldquo;I mind that bridge gang in the reader. Me, I go
instructed for the other chap&ndash;Spurious Somebody&ndash;the one that fought and pulled his
freight, to fight &lsquo;em on some other day.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; summed up Broncho, &ldquo;Bob&rsquo;s about the gamest man I ever see along the Rio
Bravo. Great Sam Houston! If she gets any hotter she&rsquo;ll sizzle!&rdquo; Broncho whacked at a
scorpion with his four-pound Stetson felt, and the three watchers relapsed into comfortless
silence.
How well Bob Buckley had kept his secret, since these men, for two years his side
comrades in countless border raids and dangers, thus spake of him, not knowing that he was
the most arrant physical coward in all that Rio Bravo country! Neither his friends nor his
enemies had suspected him of aught else than the finest courage. It was purely a physical
cowardice, and only by an extreme, grim effort of will had he forced his craven body to do
the bravest deeds. Scourging himself always, as a monk whips his besetting sin, Buckley
threw himself with apparent recklessness into every danger, with the hope of some day
ridding himself of the despised affliction. But each successive test brought no relief, and the
ranger&rsquo;s face, by nature adapted to cheerfulness and good-humour, became set to the guise
of gloomy melancholy. Thus, while the frontier admired his deeds, and his prowess was
celebrated in print and by word of mouth in many camp- fires in the valley of the Bravo, his
heart was sick within him. Only himself knew of the horrible tightening of the chest, the dry
mouth, the weakening of the spine, the agony of the strung nerves&ndash;the never- failing
symptoms of his shameful malady.
One mere boy in his company was wont to enter a fray with a leg perched flippantly
about the horn of his saddle, a cigarette hanging from his lips, which emitted smoke and
original slogans of clever invention. Buckley would have given a year&rsquo;s pay to attain that
devil- may-care method. Once the debonair youth said to him: &ldquo;Buck, you go into a scrap like
it was a funeral. Not,&rdquo; he added, with a complimentary wave of his tin cup, &ldquo;but what it
generally is.&rdquo;
Buckley&rsquo;s conscience was of the New England order with Western adjustments, and he
continued to get his rebellious body into as many difficulties as possible; wherefore, on that
sultry afternoon he chose to drive his own protesting limbs to investigation of that sudden
alarm that had startled the peace and dignity of the State.
Two squares down the street stood the Top Notch Saloon. Here Buckley came upon
signs of recent upheaval. A few curious spectators pressed about its front entrance, grinding
beneath their heels the fragments of a plate-glass window. Inside, Buckley found Bud
Dawson utterly ignoring a bullet wound in his shoulder, while he feelingly wept at having toexplain why he failed to drop the &ldquo;blamed masquerooter,&rdquo; who shot him. At the entrance of
the ranger Bud turned appealingly to him for confirmation of the devastation he might have
dealt.
&ldquo;You know, Buck, I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; plum got him, first rattle, if I&rsquo;d thought a minute. Come in
a-masque-rootin&rsquo;, playin&rsquo; female till he got the drop, and turned loose. I never reached for a
gun, thinkin&rsquo; it was sure Chihuahua Betty, or Mrs. Atwater, or anyhow one of the Mayfield
girls comin&rsquo; a-gunnin&rsquo;, which they might, liable as not. I never thought of that blamed Garcia
until&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Garcia!&rdquo; snapped Buckley. &ldquo;How did he get over here?&rdquo;
Bud&rsquo;s bartender took the ranger by the arm and led him to the side door. There stood a
patient grey burro cropping the grass along the gutter, with a load of kindling wood tied
across its back. On the ground lay a black shawl and a voluminous brown dress.
&ldquo;Masquerootin&rsquo; in them things,&rdquo; called Bud, still resisting attempted ministrations to his
wounds. &ldquo;Thought he was a lady till he gave a yell and winged me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He went down this side street,&rdquo; said the bartender. &ldquo;He was alone, and he&rsquo;ll hide out
till night when his gang comes over. You ought to find him in that Mexican lay-out below the
depot. He&rsquo;s got a girl down there&ndash;Pancha Sales.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How was he armed?&rdquo; asked Buckley.
&ldquo;Two pearl-handled sixes, and a knife.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Keep this for me, Billy,&rdquo; said the ranger, handing over his Winchester. Quixotic,
perhaps, but it was Bob Buckley&rsquo;s way. Another man&ndash;and a braver one&ndash;might have raised a
posse to accompany him. It was Buckley&rsquo;s rule to discard all preliminary advantage.
The Mexican had left behind him a wake of closed doors and an empty street, but now
people were beginning to emerge from their places of refuge with assumed unconsciousness
of anything having happened. Many citizens who knew the ranger pointed out to him with
alacrity the course of Garcia&rsquo;s retreat.
As Buckley swung along upon the trail he felt the beginning of the suffocating
constriction about his throat, the cold sweat under the brim of his hat, the old, shameful,
dreaded sinking of his heart as it went down, down, down in his bosom.
*****The morning train of the Mexican Central had that day been three hours late, thus
failing to connect with the I. &amp; G.N. on the other side of the river. Passengers for Los Estados
Unidos grumblingly sought entertainment in the little swaggering mongrel town of two
nations, for, until the morrow, no other train would come to rescue them. Grumblingly,
because two days later would begin the great fair and races in San Antone. Consider that at
that time San Antone was the hub of the wheel of Fortune, and the names of its spokes
were Cattle, Wool, Faro, Running Horses, and Ozone. In those times cattlemen played at
crack-loo on the sidewalks with double-eagles, and gentlemen backed their conception of
the fortuitous card with stacks limited in height only by the interference of gravity.
Wherefore, thither journeyed the sowers and the reapers&ndash;they who stampeded the dollars,
and they who rounded them up. Especially did the caterers to the amusement of the people
haste to San Antone. Two greatest shows on earth were already there, and dozens of
smallest ones were on the way.
On a side track near the mean little &lsquo;dobe depot stood a private car, left there by the
Mexican train that morning and doomed by an ineffectual schedule to ignobly await, amid
squalid surroundings, connection with the next day&rsquo;s regular.
The car had been once a common day-coach, but those who had sat in it and gringed to
the conductor&rsquo;s hat-band slips would never have recognised it in its transformation. Paint
and gilding and certain domestic touches had liberated it from any suspicion of public
servitude. The whitest of lace curtains judiciously screened its windows. From its fore end
drooped in the torrid air the flag of Mexico. From its rear projected the Stars and Stripes and
a busy stovepipe, the latter reinforcing in its suggestion of culinary comforts the general
suggestion of privacy and ease. The beholder&rsquo;s eye, regarding its gorgeous sides, found
interest to culminate in a single name in gold and blue letters extending almost its entire
length&ndash;a single name, the audacious privilege of royalty and genius. Doubly, then, was this
arrogant nomenclature here justified; for the name was that of &ldquo;Alvarita, Queen of the
Serpent Tribe.&rdquo; This, her car, was back from a triumphant tour of the principal Mexican cities,
and now headed for San Antonio, where, according to promissory advertisement, she would
exhibit her &ldquo;Marvellous Dominion and Fearless Control over Deadly and Venomous Serpents,
Handling them with Ease as they Coil and Hiss to the Terror of Thousands of Tongue-tied
Tremblers!&rdquo;
One hundred in the shade kept the vicinity somewhat depeopled. This quarter of the
town was a ragged edge; its denizens the bubbling froth of five nations; its architecture tent,
jacal, and &lsquo;dobe; its distractions the hurdy-gurdy and the informal contribution to the
sudden stranger&rsquo;s store of experience. Beyond this dishonourable fringe upon the old town&rsquo;s
jowl rose a dense mass of trees, surmounting and filling a little hollow. Through this bickered
a small stream that perished down the sheer and disconcerting side of the great canon of
the Rio Bravo del Norte.
In this sordid spot was condemned to remain for certain hours the impotent transport
of the Queen of the Serpent Tribe.The front door of the car was open. Its forward end was curtained off into a small
reception-room. Here the admiring and propitiatory reporters were wont to sit and
transpose the music of Senorita Alvarita&rsquo;s talk into the more florid key of the press. A picture
of Abraham Lincoln hung against a wall; one of a cluster of school-girls grouped upon stone
steps was in another place; a third was Easter lilies in a blood-red frame. A neat carpet was
under foot. A pitcher, sweating cold drops, and a glass stood on a fragile stand. In a willow
rocker, reading a newspaper, sat Alvarita.
Spanish, you would say; Andalusian, or, better still, Basque; that compound, like the
diamond, of darkness and fire. Hair, the shade of purple grapes viewed at midnight. Eyes,
long, dusky, and disquieting with their untroubled directness of gaze. Face, haughty and bold,
touched with a pretty insolence that gave it life. To hasten conviction of her charm, but
glance at the stacks of handbills in the corner, green, and yellow, and white. Upon them you
see an incompetent presentment of the senorita in her professional garb and pose.
Irresistible, in black lace and yellow ribbons, she faces you; a blue racer is spiralled upon
each bare arm; coiled twice about her waist and once about her neck, his horrid head close
to hers, you perceive Kuku, the great eleven-foot Asian python.
A hand drew aside the curtain that partitioned the car, and a middle- aged, faded
woman holding a knife and a half-peeled potato looked in and said:
&ldquo;Alviry, are you right busy?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m reading the home paper, ma. What do you think! that pale, tow- headed Matilda
Price got the most votes in the News for the prettiest girl in Gallipo&ndash;lees.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shush! She wouldn&rsquo;t of done it if you&rsquo;d been home, Alviry. Lord knows, I hope we&rsquo;ll be
there before fall&rsquo;s over. I&rsquo;m tired gallopin&rsquo; round the world playin&rsquo; we are dagoes, and givin&rsquo;
snake shows. But that ain&rsquo;t what I wanted to say. That there biggest snake&rsquo;s gone again. I&rsquo;ve
looked all over the car and can&rsquo;t find him. He must have been gone an hour. I remember
hearin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; rustlin&rsquo; along the floor, but I thought it was you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, blame that old rascal!&rdquo; exclaimed the Queen, throwing down her paper. &ldquo;This is
the third time he&rsquo;s got away. George never will fasten down the lid to his box properly. I do
believe he&rsquo;s afraid of Kuku. Now I&rsquo;ve got to go hunt him.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Better hurry; somebody might hurt him.&rdquo;
The Queen&rsquo;s teeth showed in a gleaming, contemptuous smile. &ldquo;No danger. When they
see Kuku outside they simply scoot away and buy bromides. There&rsquo;s a crick over between
here and the river. That old scamp&rsquo;d swap his skin any time for a drink of running water. I
guess I&rsquo;ll find him there, all right.&ldquo;A few minutes later Alvarita stopped upon the forward platform, ready for her quest.
Her handsome black skirt was shaped to the most recent proclamation of fashion. Her
spotless shirt-waist gladdened the eye in that desert of sunshine, a swelling oasis, cool and
fresh. A man&rsquo;s split-straw hat sat firmly on her coiled, abundant hair. Beneath her serene,
round, impudent chin a man&rsquo;s four-in-hand tie was jauntily knotted about a man&rsquo;s high, stiff
collar. A parasol she carried, of white silk, and its fringe was lace, yellowly genuine.
I will grant Gallipolis as to her costume, but firmly to Seville or Valladolid I am held by
her eyes; castanets, balconies, mantillas, serenades, ambuscades, escapades&ndash;all these their
dark depths guaranteed.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you afraid to go out alone, Alviry?&rdquo; queried the Queen-mother anxiously.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so many rough people about. Mebbe you&rsquo;d better&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I never saw anything I was afraid of yet, ma. &lsquo;Specially people. And men in particular.
Don&rsquo;t you fret. I&rsquo;ll trot along back as soon as I find that runaway scamp.&rdquo;
The dust lay thick upon the bare ground near the tracks. Alvarita&rsquo;s eye soon discovered
the serrated trail of the escaped python. It led across the depot grounds and away down a
smaller street in the direction of the little canon, as predicted by her. A stillness and lack of
excitement in the neighbourhood encouraged the hope that, as yet, the inhabitants were
unaware that so formidable a guest traversed their highways. The heat had driven them
indoors, whence outdrifted occasional shrill laughs, or the depressing whine of a maltreated
concertina. In the shade a few Mexican children, like vivified stolid idols in clay, stared from
their play, vision-struck and silent, as Alvarita came and went. Here and there a woman
peeped from a door and stood dumb, reduced to silence by the aspect of the white silk
parasol.
A hundred yards and the limits of the town were passed, scattered chaparral
succeeding, and then a noble grove, overflowing the bijou canon. Through this a small bright
stream meandered. Park-like it was, with a kind of cockney ruralness further endorsed by
the waste papers and rifled tins of picnickers. Up this stream, and down it, among its
pseudo-sylvan glades and depressions, wandered the bright and unruffled Alvarita. Once she
saw evidence of the recreant reptile&rsquo;s progress in his distinctive trail across a spread of fine
sand in the arroyo. The living water was bound to lure him; he could not be far away.
So sure was she of his immediate proximity that she perched herself to idle for a time in
the curve of a great creeper that looped down from a giant water-elm. To reach this she
climbed from the pathway a little distance up the side of a steep and rugged incline. Around
her chaparral grew thick and high. A late-blooming ratama tree dispensed from its yellow
petals a sweet and persistent odour. Adown the ravine rustled a seductive wind, melancholy
with the taste of sodden, fallen leaves.Alvarita removed her hat, and undoing the oppressive convolutions of her hair, began
to slowly arrange it in two long, dusky plaits.
From the obscure depths of a thick clump of evergreen shrubs five feet away, two small
jewel-bright eyes were steadfastly regarding her. Coiled there lay Kuku, the great python;
Kuku, the magnificent, he of the plated muzzle, the grooved lips, the eleven-foot stretch of
elegantly and brilliantly mottled skin. The great python was viewing his mistress without a
sound or motion to disclose his presence. Perhaps the splendid truant forefelt his capture,
but, screened by the foliage, thought to prolong the delight of his escapade. What pleasure
it was, after the hot and dusty car, to lie thus, smelling the running water, and feeling the
agreeable roughness of the earth and stones against his body! Soon, very soon the Queen
would find him, and he, powerless as a worm in her audacious hands, would be returned to
the dark chest in the narrow house that ran on wheels.
Alvarita heard a sudden crunching of the gravel below her. Turning her head she saw a
big, swarthy Mexican, with a daring and evil expression, contemplating her with an ominous,
dull eye.
&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she asked as sharply as five hairpins between her lips would
permit, continuing to plait her hair, and looking him over with placid contempt. The Mexican
continued to gaze at her, and showed his teeth in a white, jagged smile.
&ldquo;I no hurt-y you, Senorita,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You bet you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered the Queen, shaking back one finished, massive plait.
&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;d better move on?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not hurt-y you&ndash;no. But maybeso take one beso&ndash;one li&rsquo;l kees, you call him.&rdquo;
The man smiled again, and set his foot to ascend the slope. Alvarita leaned swiftly and
picked up a stone the size of a cocoanut.
&ldquo;Vamoose, quick,&rdquo; she ordered peremptorily, &ldquo;you coon!&rdquo;
The red of insult burned through the Mexican&rsquo;s dark skin.
&ldquo;Hidalgo, Yo!&rdquo; he shot between his fangs. &ldquo;I am not neg-r-ro! Diabla bonita, for that you
shall pay me.&rdquo;
He made two quick upward steps this time, but the stone, hurled by no weak arm,
struck him square in the chest. He staggered back to the footway, swerved half around, and
met another sight that drove all thoughts of the girl from his head. She turned her eyes to
see what had diverted his interest. A man with red-brown, curling hair and a melancholy,
sunburned, smooth-shaven face was coming up the path, twenty yards away. Around theMexican&rsquo;s waist was buckled a pistol belt with two empty holsters. He had laid aside his
sixes&ndash;possibly in the jacal of the fair Pancha&ndash;and had forgotten them when the passing of
the fairer Alvarita had enticed him to her trail. His hands now flew instinctively to the
holsters, but finding the weapons gone, he spread his fingers outward with the eloquent,
abjuring, deprecating Latin gesture, and stood like a rock. Seeing his plight, the newcomer
unbuckled his own belt containing two revolvers, threw it upon the ground, and continued
to advance.
&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; murmured Alvarita, with flashing eyes.</p>

<hr />

<p>As Bob Buckley, according to the mad code of bravery that his sensitive conscience
imposed upon his cowardly nerves, abandoned his guns and closed in upon his enemy, the
old, inevitable nausea of abject fear wrung him. His breath whistled through his constricted
air passages. His feet seemed like lumps of lead. His mouth was dry as dust. His heart,
congested with blood, hurt his ribs as it thumped against them. The hot June day turned to
moist November. And still he advanced, spurred by a mandatory pride that strained its
uttermost against his weakling flesh.
The distance between the two men slowly lessened. The Mexican stood, immovable,
waiting. When scarce five yards separated them a little shower of loosened gravel rattled
down from above to the ranger&rsquo;s feet. He glanced upward with instinctive caution. A pair of
dark eyes, brilliantly soft, and fierily tender, encountered and held his own. The most fearful
heart and the boldest one in all the Rio Bravo country exchanged a silent and inscrutable
communication. Alvarita, still seated within her vine, leaned forward above the breast-high
chaparral. One hand was laid across her bosom. One great dark braid curved forward over
her shoulder. Her lips were parted; her face was lit with what seemed but wonder&ndash;great and
absolute wonder. Her eyes lingered upon Buckley&rsquo;s. Let no one ask or presume to tell
through what subtle medium the miracle was performed. As by a lightning flash two clouds
will accomplish counterpoise and compensation of electric surcharge, so on that eyeglance
the man received his complement of manhood, and the maid conceded what enriched her
womanly grace by its loss.
The Mexican, suddenly stirring, ventilated his attitude of apathetic waiting by conjuring
swiftly from his bootleg a long knife. Buckley cast aside his hat, and laughed once aloud, like
a happy school-boy at a frolic. Then, empty-handed, he sprang nimbly, and Garcia met him
without default.
So soon was the engagement ended that disappointment imposed upon the ranger&rsquo;s
warlike ecstasy. Instead of dealing the traditional downward stroke, the Mexican lunged
straight with his knife. Buckley took the precarious chance, and caught his wrist, fair and
firm. Then he delivered the good Saxon knock-out blow&ndash;always so pathetically disastrous tothe fistless Latin races&ndash;and Garcia was down and out, with his head under a clump of prickly
pears. The ranger looked up again to the Queen of the Serpents.
Alvarita scrambled down to the path.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad I happened along when I did,&rdquo; said the ranger.
&ldquo;He&ndash;he frightened me so!&rdquo; cooed Alvarita.
They did not hear the long, low hiss of the python under the shrubs. Wiliest of the
beasts, no doubt he was expressing the humiliation he felt at having so long dwelt in
subjection to this trembling and colouring mistress of his whom he had deemed so strong
and potent and fearsome.
Then came galloping to the spot the civic authorities; and to them the ranger awarded
the prostrate disturber of the peace, whom they bore away limply across the saddle of one
of their mounts. But Buckley and Alvarita lingered.
Slowly, slowly they walked. The ranger regained his belt of weapons. With a fine
timidity she begged the indulgence of fingering the great .45&rsquo;s, with little &ldquo;Ohs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ahs&rdquo; of
new-born, delicious shyness.
The canoncito was growing dusky. Beyond its terminus in the river bluff they could see
the outer world yet suffused with the waning glory of sunset.
A scream&ndash;a piercing scream of fright from Alvarita. Back she cowered, and the ready,
protecting arm of Buckley formed her refuge. What terror so dire as to thus beset the close
of the reign of the never- before-daunted Queen?
Across the path there crawled a caterpillar&ndash;a horrid, fuzzy, two- inch caterpillar! Truly,
Kuku, thou went avenged. Thus abdicated the Queen of the Serpent Tribe&ndash;viva la reina!
Babes In The Jungle （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Montague Silver, the finest street man and art grafter in the West, says to me once in
Little Rock: &ldquo;If you ever lose your mind, Billy, and get too old to do honest swindling among
grown men, go to New York. In the West a sucker is born every minute; but in New York they
appear in chunks of roe - you can&rsquo;t count &lsquo;em!&ldquo;Two years afterward I found that I couldn&rsquo;t remember the names of the Russian
admirals, and I noticed some gray hairs over my left ear; so I knew the time had arrived for
me to take Silver&rsquo;s advice.
I struck New York about noon one day, and took a walk up Broadway. And I run against
Silver himself, all encompassed up in a spacious kind of haberdashery, leaning against a hotel
and rubbing the half-moons on his nails with a silk handkerchief.
&ldquo;Paresis or superannuated?&rdquo; I asks him.
&ldquo;Hello, Billy,&rdquo; says Silver; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you. Yes, it seemed to me that the West was
accumulating a little too much wiseness. I&rsquo;ve been saving New York for dessert. I know it&rsquo;s a
low-down trick to take things from these people. They only know this and that and pass to
and fro and think ever and anon. I&rsquo;d hate for my mother to know I was skinning these
weak-minded ones. She raised me better.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Is there a crush already in the waiting rooms of the old doctor that does skin grafting?&rdquo;
I asks.
&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; says Silver; &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t back Epidermis to win today. I&rsquo;ve only been here a
month. But I&rsquo;m ready to begin; and the members of Willie Manhattan&rsquo;s Sunday School class,
each of whom has volunteered to contribute a portion of cuticle toward this rehabilitation,
may as well send their photos to the Evening Daily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been studying the town,&rdquo; says Silver, &ldquo;and reading the papers every day, and I
know it as well as the cat in the City Hall knows an O&rsquo;Sullivan. People here lie down on the
floor and scream and kick when you are the least bit slow about taking money from them.
Come up in my room and I&rsquo;ll tell you. We&rsquo;ll work the town together, Billy, for the sake of old
times.&rdquo;
Silver takes me up in a hotel. He has a quantity of irrelevant objects lying about.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more ways of getting money from these metropolitan hayseeds,&rdquo; says Silver,
&ldquo;than there is of cooking rice in Charleston, S. C. They&rsquo;ll bite at anything. The brains of most
of &lsquo;em commute. The wiser they are in intelligence the less perception of cognizance they
have. Why, didin&rsquo;t a man the other day sell J. P. Morgan an oil portrait of Rockefeller, Jr., for
Andrea del Sarto&rsquo;s celebrated painting of the young Saint John!
&ldquo;You see that bundle of printed stuff in the corner, Billy? That&rsquo;s gold mining stock. I
started out one day to sell that, but I quit it in two hours. Why? Got arrested for blocking the
street. People fought to buy it. I sold the policeman a block of it on the way to the
station-house, and then I took it off the market. I don&rsquo;t want people to give me their money.
I want some little consideration connected with the transaction to keep my pride from beinghurt. I want &lsquo;em to guess the missing letter in Chic-go, or draw to a pair of nines before they
pay me a cent of money.
&ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s another little scheme that worked so easy I had to quit it. You see that
bottle of blue ink on the table? I tattooed an anchor on the back of my hand and went to a
bank and told &lsquo;em I was Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s nephew. They offered to cash my draft on him for a
thousand, but I didn&rsquo;t know my uncle&rsquo;s first name. It shows, though, what an easy town it is.
As for burglars, they won&rsquo;t go in a house now unless there&rsquo;s a hot supper ready and a few
college students to wait on &lsquo;em. They&rsquo;re slugging citizens all over the upper part of the city
and I guess, taking the town from end to end, it&rsquo;s a plain case of assault and Battery.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Monty,&rdquo; says I, when Silver had slacked, up, &ldquo;you may have Manhattan correctly
discriminated in your perorative, but I doubt it. I&rsquo;ve only been in town two hours, but it don&rsquo;t
dawn upon me that it&rsquo;s ours with a cherry in it. There ain&rsquo;t enough rus in urbe about it to
suit me. I&rsquo;d be a good deal much better satisfied if the citizens had a straw or more in their
hair, and run more to velveteen vests and buckeye watch charms. They don&rsquo;t look easy to
me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it, Billy,&rdquo; says Silver. &ldquo;All emigrants have it. New York&rsquo;s bigger than Little
Rock or Europe, and it frightens a foreigner. You&rsquo;ll be all right. I tell you I feel like slapping the
people here because they don&rsquo;t send me all their money in laundry baskets, with germicide
sprinkled over it. I hate to go down on the street to get it. Who wears the diamonds in this
town? Why, Winnie, the Wiretapper&rsquo;s wife, and Bella, the Buncosteerer&rsquo;s bride. New Yorkers
can be worked easier than a blue rose on a tidy. The only thing that bothers me is I know I&rsquo;ll
break the cigars in my vest pocket when I get my clothes all full of twenties.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I hope you are right, Monty,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;but I wish all the same I had been satisfied with a
small business in Little Rock. The crop of farmers is never so short out there but what you
can get a few of &lsquo;em to sign a petition for a new post office that you can discount for $200 at
the county bank. The people hear appear to possess instincts of self-preservation and
illiberality. I fear me that we are not cultured enough to tackle this game.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; says Silver. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this Jayville-near-Tarrytown correctly estimated as
sure as North River is the Hudson and East River ain&rsquo;t a river. Why, there are people living in
four blocks of Broadway who never saw any kind of a building except a skyscraper in their
lives! A good, live hustling Western man ought to get conspicuous enough here inside of
three months to incur either Jerome&rsquo;s clemency or Lawson&rsquo;s displeasure.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hyperbole aside,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;do you know of any immediate system of buncoing the
community out of a dollar or two except by applying to the Salvation Army or having a fit on
Miss Helen Gould&rsquo;s doorsteps?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dozens of &lsquo;em,&rdquo; says Silver. &ldquo;How much capital have you got, Billy?&rdquo;&ldquo;A thousand,&rdquo; I told him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got $1,200,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pool and do a big piece of business. There&rsquo;s so many
ways we can make a million that I don&rsquo;t know how to begin.&rdquo;
The next morning Silver meets me at the hotel and he is all sonorous and stirred with a
kind of silent joy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re to meet J. P. Morgan this afternoon,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;A man I know in the hotel wants
to introduce us. He&rsquo;s a friend of his. He says he likes to meet people from the West.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That sounds nice and plausible,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know Mr. Morgan.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt us a bit,&rdquo; says Silver, &ldquo;to get acquainted with a few finance kings. I kind of
like the social way New York has with strangers.&rdquo;
The man Silver knew was named Klein. At three o&rsquo;clock Klein brought his Wall Street
friend to see us in Silver&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;Mr. Morgan&rdquo; looked some like his pictures, and he had a
Turkish towel wrapped around his left foot, and he walked with a cane.
&ldquo;Mr. Silver and Mr. Pescud,&rdquo; says Klein. &ldquo;It sounds superfluous,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to mention
the name of the greatest financial -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cut it out, Klein,&rdquo; says Mr. Morgan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to know you gents; I take great interest in
the West. Klein tells me you&rsquo;re from Little Rock. I think I&rsquo;ve a railroad or two out there
somewhere. If either of you guys would like to deal a hand or two of stud poker I -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Now, Pierpont,&rdquo; cuts in Klein, &ldquo;you forget!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Excuse me, gents!&rdquo; says Morgan; &ldquo;since I&rsquo;ve had the gout so bad I sometimes play a
social game of cards at my house. Neither of you never knew One-eyed Peters, did you,
while you was around Little Rock? He lived in Seattle, New Mexico.&rdquo;
Before we could answer, Mr. Morgan hammers on the floor with his can and begins to
walk up and down, swearing in a loud tone of voice.
&ldquo;They have been pounding your stocks to-day on the Street, Pierpont?&rdquo; asks Klein,
smiling.
&ldquo;Stocks! No!&rdquo; roars Mr. Morgan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that picture I sent an agent to Europe to buy. I just
thought about it. He cabled me to-day that it ain&rsquo;t to be found in all Italy. I&rsquo;d pay $50,000
to-morrow for that picture - yes, $75,000. I give the agent a la carte in purchasing it. I cannot
understand why the art galleries will allow a De Vinchy to -&ldquo;&ldquo;Why, Mr. Morgan,&rdquo; says klein; &ldquo;I thought you owned all of the De Vinchy paintings.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What is the picture like, Mr. Morgan?&rdquo; asks Silver. &ldquo;It must be as big as the side of the
Flatiron Building.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your art education is on the bum, Mr. Silver,&rdquo; says Morgan. &ldquo;The picture is 27
inches by 42; and it is called &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Idle Hour.&rsquo; It represents a number of cloak models doing
the two-step on the bank of a purple river. The cablegram said it might have been brought to
this country. My collection will never be complete without that picture. Well, so long, gents;
us financiers must keep early hours.&rdquo;
Mr. Morgan and Klein went away together in a cab. Me and Silver talked about how
simple and unsuspecting great people was; and Silver said what a shame it would be to try
to rob a man like Mr. Morgan; and I said I thought it would be rather imprudent, myself.
Klein proposes a stroll after dinner; and me and him and Silver walks down toward Seventh
Avenue to see the sights. Klein sees a pair of cuff links that instigate his admiration in a
pawnshop window, and we all go in while he buys &lsquo;em.
After we got back to the hotel and Klein had gone, Silver jumps at me and waves his
hands.
&ldquo;Did you see it?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Did you see it, Billy?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I asks.
&ldquo;Why, that picture that Morgan wants. It&rsquo;s hanging in that pawnshop, behind the desk. I
didn&rsquo;t say anything because Klein was there. It&rsquo;s the article sure as you live. The girls are as
natural as paint can make them, all measuring 36 and 25 and 42 skirts, if they had any skirts,
and they&rsquo;re doing a buck-and-wing on the bank of a river with the blues. What did Mr.
Morgan say he&rsquo;d give for it? Oh, don&rsquo;t make me tell you. They can&rsquo;t know what it is in that
pawnshop.&rdquo;
When the pawnshop opened the next morning me and Silver was standing there as
anxious as if we wanted to soak our Sunday suit to buy a drink. We sauntered inside, and
began to look at watch-chains.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a violent specimen of a chromo you&rsquo;ve got up there,&rdquo; remarked Silver, casual, to
the pawnbroker. &ldquo;But I kind of enthuse over the girl with the shoulderblades and red bunting.
Would an offer of $2.25 for it cause you to knock over any fragile articles of your stock in
hurrying it off the nail?&rdquo;
The pawnbroker smiles and goes on showing us plate watch-chains.&ldquo;That picture,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;was pledged a year ago by an Italian gentleman. I loaned him
$500 on it. It is called &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Idle Hour,&rsquo; and it is by Leonardo de Vinchy. Two days ago the
legal time expired, and it became an unredeemed pledge. Here is a style of chain that is
worn a great deal now.&rdquo;
At the end of half an hour me and Silver paid the pawnbroker $2,000 and walked out
with the picture. Silver got into a cab with it and started for Morgan&rsquo;s office. I goes to the
hotel and waits for him. In two hours Silver comes back.
&ldquo;Did you see Mr. Morgan?&rdquo; I asks. &ldquo;How much did he pay you for it?&rdquo;
Silver sits down and fools with a tassel on the table cover.
&ldquo;I never exactly saw Mr. Morgan,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;because Mr. Morgan&rsquo;s been in Europe for a
month. But what&rsquo;s worrying me, Billy, is this: The department stores have all got that same
picture on sale, framed, for $3.48. And they charge $3.50 for the frame alone - that&rsquo;s what I
can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
Best-Seller （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>I
One day last summer I went to Pittsburgh&ndash;well, I had to go there on business.
My chair-car was profitably well filled with people of the kind one usually sees on
chair-cars. Most of them were ladies in brown-silk dresses cut with square yokes, with lace
insertion, and dotted veils, who refused to have the windows raised. Then there was the
usual number of men who looked as if they might be in almost any business and going
almost anywhere. Some students of human nature can look at a man in a Pullman and tell
you where he is from, his occupation and his stations in life, both flag and social; but I never
could. The only way I can correctly judge a fellow-traveller is when the train is held up by
robbers, or when he reaches at the same time I do for the last towel in the dressing-room of
the sleeper.
The porter came and brushed the collection of soot on the window-sill off to the left
knee of my trousers. I removed it with an air of apology. The temperature was eighty-eight.
One of the dotted-veiled ladies demanded the closing of two more ventilators, and spokeloudly of Interlaken. I leaned back idly in chair No. 7, and looked with the tepidest curiosity
at the small, black, bald-spotted head just visible above the back of No. 9.
Suddenly No. 9 hurled a book to the floor between his chair and the window, and,
looking, I saw that it was The Rose-Lady and Trevelyan, one of the best-selling novels of the
present day. And then the critic or Philistine, whichever he was, veered his chair toward the
window, and I knew him at once for John A. Pescud, of Pittsburgh, travelling salesman for a
plate-glass company&ndash;an old acquaintance whom I had not seen in two years.
In two minutes we were faced, had shaken hands, and had finished with such topics as
rain, prosperity, health, residence, and destination. Politics might have followed next; but I
was not so ill-fated.
I wish you might know John A. Pescud. He is of the stuff that heroes are not often lucky
enough to be made of. He is a small man with a wide smile, and an eye that seems to be
fixed upon that little red spot on the end of your nose. I never saw him wear but one kind of
necktie, and he believes in cuff-holders and button-shoes. He is as hard and true as anything
ever turned out by the Cambria Steel Works; and he believes that as soon as Pittsburgh
makes smoke-consumers compulsory, St. Peter will come down and sit at the foot of
Smithfield Street, and let somebody else attend to the gate up in the branch heaven. He
believes that &ldquo;our&rdquo; plate-glass is the most important commodity in the world, and that when
a man is in his home town he ought to be decent and law-abiding.
During my acquaintance with him in the City of Diurnal Night I had never known his
views on life, romance, literature, and ethics. We had browsed, during our meetings, on
local topics, and then parted, after Chateau Margaux, Irish stew, flannel-cakes,
cottage-pudding, and coffee (hey, there!&ndash;with milk separate). Now I was to get more of his
ideas. By way of facts, he told me that business had picked up since the party conventions,
and that he was going to get off at Coketown.
II
&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Pescud, stirring his discarded book with the toe of his right shoe, &ldquo;did you
ever read one of these best-sellers? I mean the kind where the hero is an American
swell&ndash;sometimes even from Chicago- -who falls in love with a royal princess from Europe
who is travelling under an alias, and follows her to her father&rsquo;s kingdom or principality? I
guess you have. They&rsquo;re all alike. Sometimes this going-away masher is a Washington
newspaper correspondent, and sometimes he is a Van Something from New York, or a
Chicago wheat- broker worthy fifty millions. But he&rsquo;s always ready to break into the king row
of any foreign country that sends over their queens and princesses to try the new plush
seats on the Big Four or the B. and 0. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any other reason in the book
for their being here.&ldquo;Well, this fellow chases the royal chair-warmer home, as I said, and finds out who she
is. He meets here on the corso or the strasse one evening and gives us ten pages of
conversation. She reminds him of the difference in their stations, and that gives him a
chance to ring in three solid pages about America&rsquo;s uncrowned sovereigns. If you&rsquo;d take his
remarks and set &lsquo;em to music, and then take the music away from &lsquo;em, they&rsquo;d sound exactly
like one of George Cohan&rsquo;s songs.
&ldquo;Well, you know how it runs on, if you ve read any of &lsquo;em&ndash;he slaps the king&rsquo;s Swiss
body-guards around like everything whenever they get in his way. He&rsquo;s a great fencer, too.
Now, I&rsquo;ve known of some Chicago men who were pretty notorious fences, but I never heard
of any fencers coming from there. He stands on the first landing of the royal staircase in
Castle Schutzenfestenstein with a gleaming rapier in his hand, and makes a Baltimore broil of
six platoons of traitors who come to massacre the said king. And then he has to fight duels
with a couple of chancellors, and foil a plot by four Austrian archdukes to seize the kingdom
for a gasoline-station.
&ldquo;But the great scene is when his rival for the princess&rsquo; hand, Count Feodor, attacks him
between the portcullis and the ruined chapel, armed with a mitrailleuse, a yataghan, and a
couple of Siberian bloodhounds. This scene is what runs the best-seller into the twentyninth edition before the publisher has had time to draw a check for the advance royalties.
&ldquo;The American hero shucks his coat and throws it over the heads of the bloodhounds,
gives the mitrailleuse a slap with his mitt, says &lsquo;Yah!&rsquo; to the yataghan, and lands in Kid
McCoy&rsquo;s best style on the count&rsquo;s left eye. Of course, we have a neat little prize-fight right
then and there. The count&ndash;in order to make the go possible&ndash;seems to be an expert at the
art of self-defence, himself; and here we have the Corbett-Sullivan fight done over into
literature. The book ends with the broker and the princess doing a John Cecil Clay cover
under the linden-trees on the Gorgonzola Walk. That winds up the love-story plenty good
enough. But I notice that the book dodges the final issue. Even a best-seller has sense
enough to shy at either leaving a Chicago grain broker on the throne of Lobsterpotsdam or
bringing over a real princess to eat fish and potato salad in an Italian chalet on Michigan
Avenue. What do you think about &lsquo;em?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I hardly know, John. There&rsquo;s a saying: &lsquo;Love levels all ranks,&rsquo; you know.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pescud, &ldquo;but these kind of love-stories are rank&ndash;on the level. I know
something about literature, even if I am in plate- glass. These kind of books are wrong, and
yet I never go into a train but what they pile &lsquo;em up on me. No good can come out of an
international clinch between the Old-World aristocracy and one of us fresh Americans.
When people in real life marry, they generally hunt up somebody in their own station. A
fellow usually picks out a girl that went to the same high-school and belonged to the same
singing- society that he did. When young millionaires fall in love, they always select the
chorus-girl that likes the same kind of sauce on the lobster that he does. Washington
newspaper correspondents always many widow ladies ten years older than themselves whokeep boarding-houses. No, sir, you can&rsquo;t make a novel sound right to me when it makes one
of C. D. Gibson&rsquo;s bright young men go abroad and turn kingdoms upside down just because
he&rsquo;s a Taft American aud took a course at a gymnasium. And listen how they talk, too!&rdquo;
Pescud picked up the best-seller and hunted his page.
&ldquo;Listen at this,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Trevelyan is chinning with the Princess Alwyna at the back end
of the tulip-garden. This is how it goes:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Say not so, dearest and sweetest of earth&rsquo;s fairest flowers. Would I aspire? You are a
star set high above me in a royal heaven; I am only&ndash;myself. Yet I am a man, and I have a
heart to do and dare. I have no title save that of an uncrowned sovereign; but I have an arm
and a sword that yet might free Schutzenfestenstein from the plots of traitors.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Think of a Chicago man packing a sword, and talking about freeing anything that
sounded as much like canned pork as that! He&rsquo;d be much more likely to fight to have an
import duty put on it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I think I understand you, John,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You want fiction-writers to be consistent with
their scenes and characters. They shouldn&rsquo;t mix Turkish pashas with Vermont farmers, or
English dukes with Long Island clam-diggers, or Italian countesses with Montana cowboys, or
Cincinnati brewery agents with the rajahs of India.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Or plain business men with aristocracy high above &lsquo;em,&rdquo; added Pescud. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t jibe.
People are divided into classes, whether we admit it or not, and it&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s impulse to
stick to their own class. They do it, too. I don&rsquo;t see why people go to work and buy hundreds
of thousands of books like that. You don&rsquo;t see or hear of any such didoes and capers in real
life.&rdquo;
III
&ldquo;Well, John,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t read a best-seller in a long time. Maybe I&rsquo;ve had notions
about them somewhat like yours. But tell me more about yourself. Getting along all right
with the company?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bully,&rdquo; said Pescud, brightening at once. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my salary raised twice since I saw
you, and I get a commission, too. I&rsquo;ve bought a neat slice of real estate out in the East End,
and have run up a house on it. Next year the firm is going to sell me some shares of stock.
Oh, I&rsquo;m in on the line of General Prosperity, no matter who&rsquo;s elected!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Met your affinity yet, John?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t tell you about that, did I?&rdquo; said Pescud with a broader grin.&ldquo;0-ho!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve taken time enough off from your plate- glass to have a
romance?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;No romance&ndash;nothing like that! But I&rsquo;ll tell you about it.
&ldquo;I was on the south-bound, going to Cincinnati, about eighteen months ago, when I saw,
across the aisle, the finest-looking girl I&rsquo;d ever laid eyes on. Nothing spectacular, you know,
but just the sort you want for keeps. Well, I never was up to the flirtation business, either
handkerchief, automobile, postage-stamp, or door-step, and she wasn&rsquo;t the kind to start
anything. She read a book and minded her business, which was to make the world prettier
and better just by residing on it. I kept on looking out of the side doors of my eyes, and
finally the proposition got out of the Pullman class into a case of a cottage with a lawn and
vines running over the porch. I never thought of speaking to her, but I let the plate-glass
business go to smash for a while.
&ldquo;She changed cars at Cincinnati, and took a sleeper to Louisville over the L. and N.
There she bought another ticket, and went on through Shelbyville, Frankfort, and Lexington.
Along there I began to have a hard time keeping up with her. The trains came along when
they pleased, and didn&rsquo;t seem to be going anywhere in particular, except to keep on the
track and the right of way as much as possible. Then they began to stop at junctions instead
of towns, and at last they stopped altogether. I&rsquo;ll bet Pinkerton would outbid the plate-glass
people for my services any time if they knew how I managed to shadow that young lady. I
contrived to keep out of her sight as much as I could, but I never lost track of her.
&ldquo;The last station she got off at was away down in Virginia, about six in the afternoon.
There were about fifty houses and four hundred niggers in sight. The rest was red mud,
mules, and speckled hounds.
&ldquo;A tall old man, with a smooth face and white hair, looking as proud as Julius Caesar
and Roscoe Conkling on the same post-card, was there to meet her. His clothcs were frazzled,
but I didn&rsquo;t notice that till later. He took her little satchel, and they started over the plankwalks and went up a road along the hill. I kept along a piece behind &lsquo;em, trying to look like I
was hunting a garnet ring in the sand that my sister had lost at a picnic the previous
Saturday.
&ldquo;They went in a gate on top of the hill. It nearly took my breath away when I looked up.
Up there in the biggest grove I ever saw was a tremendous house with round white pillars
about a thousand feet high, and the yard was so full of rose-bushes and box-bushes and
lilacs that you couldn&rsquo;t have seen the house if it hadn&rsquo;t been as big as the Capitol at
Washington.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s where I have to trail,&rsquo; says I to myself. &ldquo;I thought before that she seemed to be
in moderate circumstances, at least. This must be the Governor&rsquo;s mansion, or theAgricultural Building of a new World&rsquo;s Fair, anyhow. I&rsquo;d better go back to the village and get
posted by the postmaster, or drug the druggist for some information.
&ldquo;In the village I found a pine hotel called the Bay View House. The only excuse for the
name was a bay horse grazing in the front yard. I set my sample-case down, and tried to be
ostensible. I told the landlord I was taking orders for plate-glass.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want no plates,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;but I do need another glass molasses-pitcher.&rsquo;
&ldquo;By-and-by I got him down to local gossip and answering questions.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I thought everybody knowed who lived in the big white house on the
hill. It&rsquo;s Colonel Allyn, the biggest man and the finest quality in Virginia, or anywhere else.
They&rsquo;re the oldest family in the State. That was his daughter that got off the train. She&rsquo;s
been up to Illinois to see her aunt, who is sick.&rsquo;
&ldquo;I registered at the hotel, and on the third day I caught the young lady walking in the
front yard, down next to the paling fence. I stopped and raised my hat&ndash;there wasn&rsquo;t any
other way.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Excuse me,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;can you tell me where Mr. Hinkle lives?&rsquo;
&ldquo;She looks at me as cool as if I was the man come to see about the weeding of the
garden, but I thought I saw just a slight twinkle of fun in her eyes.
&ldquo;&lsquo;No one of that name lives in Birchton,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;That is,&rsquo; she goes on, &lsquo;as far as I know.
Is the gentleman you are seeking white?&rsquo;
&ldquo;Well, that tickled me. &lsquo;No kidding,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not looking for smoke, even if I do come
from Pittsburgh.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;You are quite a distance from home,&rsquo; says she.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d have gone a thousand miles farther,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Not if you hadn&rsquo;t waked up when the train started in Shelbyville,&rsquo; says she; and then
she turned almost as red as one of the roses on the bushes in the yard. I remembered I had
dropped off to sleep on a bench in the Shelbyville station, waiting to see which train she
took, and only just managed to wake up in time.
&ldquo;And then I told her why I had come, as respectful and earnest as I could. And I told her
everything about myself, and what I was making, and how that all I asked was just to get
acquainted with her and try to get her to like me.&ldquo;She smiles a little, and blushes some, but her eyes never get mixed up. They look
straight at whatever she&rsquo;s talking to.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I never had any one talk like this to me before, Mr. Pescud,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;What did you
say your name is&ndash;John?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;John A.,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;&lsquo;And you came mighty near missing the train at Powhatan Junction, too,&rsquo; says she, with
a laugh that sounded as good as a mileage-book to me.
&ldquo;&lsquo;How did you know?&rsquo; I asked.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Men are very clumsy,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;I knew you were on every train. I thought you were
going to speak to me, and I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Then we had more talk; and at last a kind of proud, serious look came on her face, and
she turned and pointed a finger at the big house.
&ldquo;&lsquo;The Allyns,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;have lived in Elmcroft for a hundred years. We are a proud
family. Look at that mansion. It has fifty rooms. See the pillars and porches and balconies.
The ceilings in the reception-rooms and the ball-room are twenty-eight feet high. My father
is a lineal descendant of belted earls.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I belted one of &lsquo;em once in the Duquesne Hotel, in Pittsburgh,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and he didn&rsquo;t
offer to resent it. He was there dividing his attentions between Monongahela whiskey and
heiresses, and he got fresh.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; she goes on, &lsquo;my father wouldn&rsquo;t allow a drummer to set his foot in
Elmeroft. If he knew that I was talking to one over the fence he would lock me in my room.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Would you let me come there?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Would you talk to me if I was to call? For,&rsquo; I
goes on, &lsquo;if you said I might come and see you, the earls might be belted or suspendered, or
pinned up with safety- pins, as far as I am concerned.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I must not talk to you,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;because we have not been introduced. It is not
exactly proper. So I will say good-bye, Mr.&ndash;&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;Say the name,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t forgotten it.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Pescud,&rsquo; says she, a little mad.
&ldquo;&lsquo;The rest of the name!&rsquo; I demands, cool as could be.
&ldquo;&lsquo;John,&rsquo; says she.&rdquo;&lsquo;John-what?&rsquo; I says.
&ldquo;&lsquo;John A.,&rsquo; says she, with her head high. &lsquo;Are you through, now?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m coming to see the belted earl to-morrow,&rsquo; I says.
&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll feed you to his fox-hounds,&rsquo; says she, laughing.
&ldquo;&lsquo;If he does, it&rsquo;ll improve their running,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m something of a hunter myself.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I must be going in now,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to have spoken to you at all. I hope you&rsquo;ll
have a pleasant trip back to Minneapolis &ndash; or Pittsburgh, was it? Good-bye!&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and it wasn&rsquo;t Minneapolis. What&rsquo;s your name, first, please?&rsquo;
&ldquo;She hesitated. Then she pulled a leaf off a bush, and said:
&ldquo;&lsquo;My name is Jessie,&rsquo; says she.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-night, Miss Allyn,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;The next morning at eleven, sharp, I rang the door-bell of that World&rsquo;s Fair main
building. After about three-quarters of an hour an old nigger man about eighty showed up
and asked what I wanted. I gave him my business card, and said I wanted to see the colonel.
He showed me in.
&ldquo;Say, did you ever crack open a wormy English walnut? That&rsquo;s what that house was like.
There wasn&rsquo;t enough furniture in it to fill an eight-dollar flat. Some old horsehair lounges
and three-legged chairs and some framed ancestors on the walls were all that met the eye.
But when Colonel Allyn comes in, the place seemed to light up. You could almost hear a
band playing, and see a bunch of old-timers in wigs and white stockings dancing a quadrille.
It was the style of him, although he had on the same shabby clothes I saw him wear at the
station.
&ldquo;For about nine seconds he had me rattled, and I came mighty near getting cold feet
and trying to sell him some plate-glass. But I got my nerve back pretty quick. He asked me to
sit down, and I told him everything. I told him how I followed his daughter from Cincinnati,
and what I did it for, and all about my salary and prospects, and explained to him my little
code of living&ndash;to be always decent and right in your home town; and when you&rsquo;re on the
road, never take more than four glasses of beer a day or play higher than a twenty-five-cent
limit. At first I thought he was going to throw me out of the window, but I kept on talking.
Pretty soon I got a chance to tell him that story about the Western Congressman who had
lost his pocket-book and the grass widow&ndash;you remember that story. Well, that got him tolaughing, and I&rsquo;ll bet that was the first laugh those ancestors and horsehair sofas had heard
in many a day.
&ldquo;We talked two hours. I told him everything I knew; and then he began to ask questions,
and I told him the rest. All I asked of him was to give me a chance. If I couldn&rsquo;t make a hit
with the little lady, I&rsquo;d clear out, and not bother any more. At last he says:
&ldquo;&lsquo;There was a Sir Courtenay Pescud in the time of Charles I, if I remember rightly.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;If there was,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;he can&rsquo;t claim kin with our bunch. We&rsquo;ve always lived in and
around Pittsburgh. I&rsquo;ve got an uncle in the real- estate business, and one in trouble
somewhere out in Kansas. You can inquire about any of the rest of us from anybody in old
Smoky Town, and get satisfactory replies. Did you ever run across that story about the
captain of the whaler who tried to make a sailor say his prayers?&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;&lsquo;It occurs to me that I have never been so fortunate,&rsquo; says the colonel.
&ldquo;So I told it to him. Laugh! I was wishing to myself that he was a customer. What a bill
of glass I&rsquo;d sell him! And then he says:
&ldquo;&lsquo;The relating of anecdotes and humorous occurrences has always seemed to me, Mr.
Pescud, to be a particularly agreeable way of promoting and perpetuating amenities
between friends. With your permission, I will relate to you a fox-hunting story with which I
was personally connected, and which may furnish you some amusement.&rsquo;
So he tells it. It takes forty minutes by the watch. Did I laugh? Well, say! When I got my
face straight he calls in old Pete, the super-annuated darky, and sends him down to the hotel
to bring up my valise. It was Elmcroft for me while I was in the town.
&ldquo;Two evenings later I got a chance to speak a word with Miss Jessie alone on the porch
while the colonel was thinking up another story.
&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a fine evening,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s coming,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s going to tell you, this time, the story about the old negro
and the green watermelons. It always comes after the one about the Yankees and the game
rooster. There was another time,&rsquo; she goes on, &lsquo;that you nearly got left&ndash;it was at Pulaski
City.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I remember. My foot slipped as I was jumping on the step, and I nearly
tumbled off.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;And&ndash;and I&ndash;I was afraid you had, John A. I was afraid you had.&rsquo;&ldquo;And then she skips into the house through one of the big windows.&rdquo;
IV
&ldquo;Coketown!&rdquo; droned the porter, making his way through the slowing car.
Pescud gathered his hat and baggage with the leisurely promptness of an old traveller.
&ldquo;I married her a year ago,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I told you I built a house in the East End. The
belted&ndash;I mean the colonel&ndash;is there, too. I find him waiting at the gate whenever I get back
from a trip to hear any new story I might have picked up on the road.&rdquo;
I glanced out of the window. Coketown was nothing more than a ragged hillside dotted
with a score of black dismal huts propped up against dreary mounds of slag and clinkers. It
rained in slanting torrents, too, and the rills foamed and splashed down through the black
mud to the railroad-tracks.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t sell much plate-glass here, John,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Why do you get off at this
end-o&rsquo;-the-world?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Pescud, &ldquo;the other day I took Jessie for a little trip to Philadelphia, and
coming back she thought she saw some petunias in a pot in one of those windows over
there just like some she used to raise down in the old Virginia home. So I thought I&rsquo;d drop
off here for the night, and see if I could dig up some of the cuttings or blossoms for her. Here
we are. Good-night, old man. I gave you the address. Come out and see us when you have
time.&rdquo;
The train moved forward. One of the dotted brown ladies insisted on having windows
raised, now that the rain beat against them. The porter came along with his mysterious
wand and began to light the car.
I glanced downward and saw the best-seller. I picked it up and set it carefully farther
along on the floor of the car, where the rain-drops would not fall upon it. And then, suddenly,
I smiled, and seemed to see that life has no geographical metes and bounds.
&ldquo;Good-luck to you, Trevelyan,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And may you get the petunias for your princess!&rdquo;
Between Rounds （O·Henry）
___________________________________________The May moon shone bright upon the private boarding-house of Mrs. Murphy. By
reference to the almanac a large amount of territory will be discovered upon which its rays
also fell. Spring was in its heydey, with hay fever soon to follow. The parks were green with
new leaves and buyers for the Western and Southern trade. Flowers and summer-resort
agents were blowing; the air and answers to Lawson were growing milder; handorgans,
fountains and pinochle were playing everywhere.
The windows of Mrs. Murphy&rsquo;s boarding-house were open. A group of boarders were
seated on the high stoop upon round, flat mats like German pancakes.
In one of the second-floor front windows Mrs. McCaskey awaited her husband. Supper
was cooling on the table. Its heat went into Mrs. McCaskey.
At nine Mr. McCaskey came. He carried his coat on his arm and his pipe in his teeth;
and he apologised for disturbing the boarders on the steps as he selected spots of stone
between them on which to set his size 9, width Ds.
As he opened the door of his room he received a surprise. Instead of the usual stove-lid
or potato-masher for him to dodge, came only words.
Mr. McCaskey reckoned that the benign May moon had softened the breast of his
spouse.
&ldquo;I heard ye,&rdquo; came the oral substitutes for kitchenware. &ldquo;Ye can apollygise to riff-raff of
the streets for settin&rsquo; yer unhandy feet on the tails of their frocks, but ye&rsquo;d walk on the neck
of yer wife the length of a clothes-line without so much as a &lsquo;Kiss me fut,&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s
that long from rubberin&rsquo; out the windy for ye and the victuals cold such as there&rsquo;s money to
buy after drinkin&rsquo; up yer wages at Gallegher&rsquo;s every Saturday evenin&rsquo;, and the gas man here
twice to-day for his.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Woman!&rdquo; said Mr. McCaskey, dashing his coat and hat upon a chair, &ldquo;the noise of ye is
an insult to me appetite. When ye run down politeness ye take the mortar from between
the bricks of the foundations of society. &lsquo;Tis no more than exercisin&rsquo; the acrimony of a
gentleman when ye ask the dissent of ladies blockin&rsquo; the way for steppin&rsquo; between them.
Will ye bring the pig&rsquo;s face of ye out of the windy and see to the food?&rdquo;
Mrs. McCaskey arose heavily and went to the stove. There was something in her
manner that warned Mr. McCaskey. When the corners of her mouth went down suddenly
like a barometer it usually foretold a fall of crockery and tinware.
&ldquo;Pig&rsquo;s face, is it?&rdquo; said Mrs. MeCaskey, and hurled a stewpan full of bacon and turnips at
her lord.Mr. McCaskey was no novice at repartee. He knew what should follow the entree. On
the table was a roast sirloin of pork, garnished with shamrocks. He retorted with this, and
drew the appropriate return of a bread pudding in an earthen dish. A hunk of Swiss cheese
accurately thrown by her husband struck Mrs. McCaskey below one eye. When she replied
with a well-aimed coffee-pot full of a hot, black, semi-fragrant liquid the battle, according to
courses, should have ended.
But Mr. McCaskey was no 50-cent table d&rsquo;hoter. Let cheap Bohemians consider coffee
the end, if they would. Let them make that faux pas. He was foxier still. Finger-bowls were
not beyond the compass of his experience. They were not to be had in the Pension Murphy;
but their equivalent was at hand. Triumphantly he sent the granite- ware wash basin at the
head of his matrimonial adversary. Mrs. McCaskey dodged in time. She reached for a flatiron,
with which, as a sort of cordial, she hoped to bring the gastronomical duel to a close. But a
loud, wailing scream downstairs caused both her and Mr. McCaskey to pause in a sort of
involuntary armistice.
On the sidewalk at the corner of the house Policeman Cleary was standing with one ear
upturned, listening to the crash of household utensils.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis Jawn McCaskey and his missis at it again,&rdquo; meditated the policeman. &ldquo;I wonder
shall I go up and stop the row. I will not. Married folks they are; and few pleasures they have.
&lsquo;Twill not last long. Sure, they&rsquo;ll have to borrow more dishes to keep it up with.&rdquo;
And just then came the loud scream below-stairs, betokening fear or dire extremity.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis probably the cat,&rdquo; said Policeman Cleary, and walked hastily in the other direction.
The boarders on the steps were fluttered. Mr. Toomey, an insurance solicitor by birth
and an investigator by profession, went inside to analyse the scream. He returned with the
news that Mrs. Murphy&rsquo;s little boy, Mike, was lost. Following the messenger, out bounced
Mrs. Murphy&ndash;two hundred pounds in tears and hysterics, clutching the air and howling to
the sky for the loss of thirty pounds of freckles and mischief. Bathos, truly; but Mr. Toomey
sat down at the side of Miss Purdy, millinery, and their hands came together in sympathy.
The two old maids, Misses Walsh, who complained every day about the noise in the halls,
inquired immediately if anybody had looked behind the clock.
Major Grigg, who sat by his fat wife on the top step, arose and buttoned his coat. &ldquo;The
little one lost?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I will scour the city.&rdquo; His wife never allowed him out after
dark. But now she said: &ldquo;Go, Ludovic!&rdquo; in a baritone voice. &ldquo;Whoever can look upon that
mother&rsquo;s grief without springing to her relief has a heart of stone.&rdquo; &ldquo;Give me some thirty
or&ndash;sixty cents, my love,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;Lost children sometimes stray far. I may need
carfares.&rdquo;
Old man Denny, hall room, fourth floor back, who sat on the lowest step, trying to read
a paper by the street lamp, turned over a page to follow up the article about the carpenters&rsquo;strike. Mrs. Murphy shrieked to the moon: &ldquo;Oh, ar-r-Mike, f&rsquo;r Gawd&rsquo;s sake, where is me little
bit av a boy?&rdquo;
&ldquo;When&rsquo;d ye see him last?&rdquo; asked old man Denny, with one eye on the report of the
Building Trades League.
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; wailed Mrs. Murphy, &ldquo;&lsquo;twas yisterday, or maybe four hours ago! I dunno. But it&rsquo;s
lost he is, me little boy Mike. He was playin&rsquo; on the sidewalk only this mornin&rsquo;&ndash;or was it
Wednesday? I&rsquo;m that busy with work, &lsquo;tis hard to keep up with dates. But I&rsquo;ve looked the
house over from top to cellar, and it&rsquo;s gone he is. Oh, for the love av Hiven&ndash;&rdquo;
Silent, grim, colossal, the big city has ever stood against its revilers. They call it hard as
iron; they say that no pulse of pity beats in its bosom; they compare its streets with lonely
forests and deserts of lava. But beneath the hard crust of the lobster is found a delectable
and luscious food. Perhaps a different simile would have been wiser. Still, nobody should
take offence. We would call no one a lobster without good and sufficient claws.
No calamity so touches the common heart of humanity as does the straying of a little
child. Their feet are so uncertain and feeble; the ways are so steep and strange.
Major Griggs hurried down to the corner, and up the avenue into Billy&rsquo;s place. &ldquo;Gimme
a rye-high,&rdquo; he said to the servitor. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen a bow-legged, dirty-faced little devil of a
six-year- old loot kid around here anywhere, have you?&rdquo;
Mr. Toomey retained Miss Purdy&rsquo;s hand on the steps. &ldquo;Think of that dear little babe,&rdquo;
said Miss Purdy, &ldquo;lost from his mother&rsquo;s side&ndash; perhaps already fallen beneath the iron hoofs
of galloping steeds&ndash; oh, isn&rsquo;t it dreadful?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo; agreed Mr. Toomey, squeezing her hand. &ldquo;Say I start out and help
look for um!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Miss Purdy, &ldquo;you should. But, oh, Mr. Toomey, you are so dashing&ndash;so
reckless&ndash;suppose in your enthusiasm some accident should befall you, then what&ndash;&rdquo;
Old man Denny read on about the arbitration agreement, with one finger on the lines.
In the second floor front Mr. and Mrs. McCaskey came to the window to recover their
second wind. Mr. McCaskey was scooping turnips out of his vest with a crooked forefinger,
and his lady was wiping an eye that the salt of the roast pork had not benefited. They heard
the outcry below, and thrust their heads out of the window.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis little Mike is lost,&rdquo; said Mrs. McCaskey, in a hushed voice, &ldquo;the beautiful, little,
trouble-making angel of a gossoon!&ldquo;&ldquo;The bit of a boy mislaid?&rdquo; said Mr. McCaskey, leaning out of the window. &ldquo;Why, now,
that&rsquo;s bad enough, entirely. The childer, they be different. If &lsquo;twas a woman I&rsquo;d be willin&rsquo;, for
they leave peace behind &lsquo;em when they go.&rdquo;
Disregarding the thrust, Mrs. McCaskey caught her husband&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;Jawn,&rdquo; she said, sentimentally, &ldquo;Missis Murphy&rsquo;s little bye is lost. &lsquo;Tis a great city for
losing little boys. Six years old he was. Jawn, &lsquo;tis the same age our little bye would have been
if we had had one six years ago.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We never did,&rdquo; said Mr. McCaskey, lingering with the fact.
&ldquo;But if we had, Jawn, think what sorrow would be in our hearts this night, with our little
Phelan run away and stolen in the city nowheres at all.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ye talk foolishness,&rdquo; said Mr. McCaskey. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis Pat he would be named, after me old
father in Cantrim.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ye lie!&rdquo; said Mrs. McCaskey, without anger. &ldquo;Me brother was worth tin dozen
bog-trotting McCaskeys. After him would the bye be named.&rdquo; She leaned over the
window-sill and looked down at the hurrying and bustle below.
&ldquo;Jawn,&rdquo; said Mrs. McCaskey, softly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I was hasty wid ye.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Twas hasty puddin&rsquo;, as ye say,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;and hurry-up turnips and
get-a-move-on-ye coffee. &lsquo;Twas what ye could call a quick lunch, all right, and tell no lie.&rdquo;
Mrs. McCaskey slipped her arm inside her husband&rsquo;s and took his rough hand in hers.
&ldquo;Listen at the cryin&rsquo; of poor Mrs. Murphy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis an awful thing for a bit of a
bye to be lost in this great big city. If &lsquo;twas our little Phelan, Jawn, I&rsquo;d be breakin&rsquo; me heart.&rdquo;
Awkwardly Mr. McCaskey withdrew his hand. But he laid it around the nearing
shoulders of his wife.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis foolishness, of course,&rdquo; said he, roughly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d be cut up some meself if our little
Pat was kidnapped or anything. But there never was any childer for us. Sometimes I&rsquo;ve been
ugly and hard with ye, Judy. Forget it.&rdquo;
They leaned together, and looked down at the heart-drama being acted below.
Long they sat thus. People surged along the sidewalk, crowding, questioning, filling the
air with rumours, and inconsequent surmises. Mrs. Murphy ploughed back and forth in theirmidst, like a soft mountain down which plunged an audible cataract of tears. Couriers came
and went.
Loud voices and a renewed uproar were raised in front of the boarding-house.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now, Judy?&rdquo; asked Mr. McCaskey.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis Missis Murphy&rsquo;s voice,&rdquo; said Mrs. McCaskey, harking. &ldquo;She says she&rsquo;s after finding
little Mike asleep behind the roll of old linoleum under the bed in her room.&rdquo;
Mr. McCaskey laughed loudly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s yer Phelan,&rdquo; he shouted, sardonically. &ldquo;Divil a bit would a Pat have done that
trick. If the bye we never had is strayed and stole, by the powers, call him Phelan, and see
him hide out under the bed like a mangy pup.&rdquo;
Mrs. McCaskey arose heavily, and went toward the dish closet, with the corners of her
mouth drawn down.
Policeman Cleary came back around the corner as the crowd dispersed. Surprised, he
upturned an ear toward the McCaskey apartment, where the crash of irons and chinaware
and the ring of hurled kitchen utensils seemed as loud as before. Policeman Cleary took out
his timepiece.
&ldquo;By the deported snakes!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;Jawn McCaskey and his lady have been
fightin&rsquo; for an hour and a quarter by the watch. The missis could give him forty pounds
weight. Strength to his arm.&rdquo;
Policeman Cleary strolled back around the corner.
Old man Denny folded his paper and hurried up the steps just as Mrs. Murphy was
about to lock the door for the night.
A Bird Of Bagdad （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Without a doubt much of the spirit and genius of the Caliph Harun Al Rashid descended
to the Margrave August Michael von Paulsen Quigg.Quigg&rsquo;s restaurant is in Fourth Avenue - that street that the city seems to have
forgotten in its growth. Fourth Avenue - born and bred in the Bowery - staggers northward
full of good resolutions.
Where it crosses Fourteenth Street it struts for a brief moment proudly in the glare of
the museums and cheap theatres. It may yet become a fit mate for its high-born sister
boulevard to the west, or its roaring, polyglot, broad-waisted cousin to the east. It passes
Union Square; and here the hoofs of the dray horses seem to thunder in unison, recalling the
tread of marching hosts - Hooray! But now come the silent and terrible mountains -
buildings square as forts, high as the clouds, shutting out the sky, where thousands of slaves
bend over desks all day. On the ground floors are only little fruit shops and laundries and
book shops, where you see copies of &ldquo;Littell&rsquo;s Living Age&rdquo; and G. W. M. Reynold&rsquo;s novels in
the windows. And next - poor Fourth Avenue! - the street glides into a mediaeval solitude.
On each side are shops devoted to &ldquo;Antiques.&rdquo;
Let us say it is night. Men in rusty armor stand in the windows and menace the hurrying
cars with raised, rusty iron gauntlets. Hauberks and helms, blunderbusses, Cromwellian
breastplates, matchlocks, creeses, and the swords and daggers of an army of dead-and-gone
gallants gleam dully in the ghostly light. Here and there from a corner saloon (lit with
Jack-o&rsquo;-lanterns or phosphorus), stagger forth shuddering, home-bound citizens, nerved by
the tankards within to their fearsome journey adown that eldrich avenue lined with the
bloodstained weapons of the fighting dead. What street could live inclosed by these
mortuary relics, and trod by these spectral citizens in whose sunken hearts scarce one good
whoop or tra-la-la remained?
Not Fourth Avenue. Not after the tinsel but enlivening glories of the Little Rialto - not
after the echoing drum-beats of Union Square. There need be no tears, ladies and
gentlemen; &lsquo;tis but the suicide of a street. With a shriek and a crash Fourth Avenue dives
headlong into the tunnel at Thirty-fourth and is never seen again.
Near the sad scene of the thoroughfare&rsquo;s dissolution stood the modest restaurant of
Quigg. It stands there yet if you care to view its crumbling red-brick front, its show window
heaped with oranges, tomatoes, layer cakes, pies, canned asparagus - its papier-mache
lobster and two Maltese kittens asleep on a bunch of lettuce - if you care to sit at one of the
little tables upon whose cloth has been traced in the yellowest of coffee stains the trail of
the Japanese advance - to sit there with one eye on your umbrella and the other upon the
bogus bottle from which you drop the counterfeit sauce foisted upon us by the cursed
charlatan who assumes to be our dear old lord and friend, the &ldquo;Nobleman in India.&rdquo;
Quigg&rsquo;s title came through his mother. One of her ancestors was a Margravine of Saxony.
His father was a Tammany brave. On account of the dilution of his heredity he found that he
could neither become a reigning potentate nor get a job in the City Hall. So he opened a
restaurant. He was a man full of thought and reading. The business gave him a living, though
he gave it little attention. One side of his house bequeathed to him a poetic and romanticadventure. The other have him the restless spirit that made him seek adventure. By day he
was Quigg, the restaurateur. By night he was the Margrave - the Caliph - the Prince of
Bohemia - going about the city in search of the odd, the mysterious, the inexplicable, the
recondite.
One night at 9, at which hour the restaurant closed, Quigg set forth upon his quest.
There was a mingling of the foreign, the military and the artistic in his appearance as he
buttoned his coat high up under his short-trimmed brown and gray beard and turned
westward toward the more central life conduits of the city. In his pocket he had stored an
assortment of cards, written upon, without which he never stirred out of doors. Each of
those cards was good at his own restaurant for its face value. Some called simply for a bowl
of soup or sandwiches and coffee; others entitled their bearer to one, two, three or more
days of full meals; a few were for single regular meals; a very few were, in effect, meal
tickets good for a week.
Of riches and power Margrave Quigg had none; but he had a Caliph&rsquo;s heart - it may be
forgiven him if his head fell short of the measure of Harun Al Rashid&rsquo;s. Perhaps some of the
gold pieces in Bagdad had put less warmth and hope into the complainants among the
bazaars than had Quigg&rsquo;s beef stew among the fishermen and one-eyed calenders of
Manhattan.
Continuing his progress in search of romance to divert him, or of distress that he might
aid, Quigg became aware of a fast-gathering crowd that whooped and fought and eddied at
a corner of Broadway and the crosstown street that he was traversing. Hurrying to the spot
he beheld a young man of an exceedingly melancholy and preoccupied demeanor engaged
in the pastime of casting silver money from his pockets in the middle of the street. With
each motion of the generous one&rsquo;s hand the crowd huddled upon the falling largesse with
yells of joy. Traffic was suspended. A policman in the centre of the mob stooped often to the
ground as he urged the blockaders to move on.
The Margrave saw at a glance that here was food for his hunger after knowledge
concerning abnormal working of the human heart. He made his way swiftly to the young
man&rsquo;s side and took his arm. &ldquo;Come with me at once,&rdquo; he said, in the low but commanding
voice that his waiters had learned to fear.
&ldquo;Pinched,&rdquo; remarked the young man, looking up at him with expressionless eyes.
&ldquo;Pinched by a painless dentist. Take me away, flatty, and give me gas. Some lay eggs and
some lay none. When is a hen?&rdquo;
Still deeply seized by some inward grief, but tractable, he allowed Quigg to lead him
away and down the street to a little park.
There, seated on a bench, he upon whom a corner of the great Caliph&rsquo;s mantle has
descended, spake with kindness and discretion, seeking to know what evil had come uponthe other, disturbing his soul and driving him to such ill-considered and ruinous waste of his
substance and stores.
&ldquo;I was doing the Monte Cristo act as adapted by Pompton, N. J., wasn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; asked the
young man.
&ldquo;You were throwing small coins into the street for the people to scramble after,&rdquo; said
the Margrave.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. You buy all the beer you can hold, and then you throw chicken feed to - Oh,
curse that word chicken, and hens, feathers, roosters, eggs, and everything connected with
it!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Young sir,&rdquo; said the Margrave kindly, but with dignity, &ldquo;though I do not ask your
confidence, I invite it. I know the world and I know humanity. Man is my study, though I do
not eye him as the scientist eyes a beetle or as the philanthropist gazes at the objects of his
bounty - through a veil of theory and ignorance. It is my pleasure and distraction to interest
myself in the peculiar and complicated misfortunes that life in a great city visits upon my
fellow-men. You may be familiar with the history of that glorious and immortal ruler, the
Caliph Harun Al Rashid, whose wise and beneficent excursions among his people in the city
of Bagdad secured him the privilege of relieving so much of their distress. In my humble way
I walk in his footsteps. I seek for romance and adventure in city streets - not in ruined castles
or in crumbling palaces. To me the greatest marvels of magic are those that take place in
men&rsquo;s hearts when acted upon by the furious and diverse forces of a crowded population. In
your strange behavior this evening I fancy a story lurks. I read in your act something deeper
than the wanton wastefulness of a spendthrift. I observe in your countenance the certain
traces of consuming grief or despair. I repeat - I invite your confidence. I am not without
some power to alleviate and advise. Will you not trust me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Gee, how you talk!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man, a gleam of admiration supplanting for a
moment the dull sadness of his eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the Astor Library skinned to a synopsis of
preceding chapters. I mind that old Turk you speak of. I read &lsquo;The Arabian Nights&rsquo; when I was
a kid. He was a kind of Bill Devery and Charlie Schwab rolled into one. But, say, you might
wave enchanted dishrags and make copper bottles smoke up coon giants all night without
ever touching me. My case won&rsquo;t yield to that kind of treatment.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If I could hear your story,&rdquo; said the Margrave, with his lofty, serious smile.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spiel it in about nine words,&rdquo; said the young man, with a deep sigh, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
think you can help me any. Unless you&rsquo;re a peach at guessing it&rsquo;s back to the Bosphorous for
you on your magic linoleum.&rdquo; THE STORY OF THE YOUNG MAN AND THE HARNESS MAKER&rsquo;S
RIDDLE&rdquo;I work in Hildebrant&rsquo;s saddle and harness shop down in Grant Street. I&rsquo;ve worked there
five years. I get $18 a week. That&rsquo;s enough to marry on, ain&rsquo;t it? Well, I&rsquo;m not going to get
married. Old Hildebrant is one of these funny Dutchmen - you know the kind - always getting
off bum jokes. He&rsquo;s got about a million riddles and things that he faked from Rogers
Brothers&rsquo; great-grandfather. Bill Watson works there, too. Me and Bill have to stand for them
chestnuts day after day. Why do we do it? Well, jobs ain&rsquo;t to be picked off every Anheuser
bush - And then there&rsquo;s Laura.
&ldquo;What? The old man&rsquo;s daughter. Comes in the shop every day. About nineteen, and the
picture of the blonde that sits on the palisades of the Rhine and charms the clam-diggers
into the surf. Hair the color of straw matting, and eyes as black and shiny as the best harness
blacking - think of that!
&ldquo;Me? well, it&rsquo;s either me or Bill Watson. She treats us both equal. Bill is all to the
psychopathic about her; and me? - well, you saw me plating the roadbed of the Great
Maroon Way with silver tonight. That was on account of Laura. I was spiflicated, Your
Highness, and I wot not of what I wouldst.
&ldquo;How? Why, old Hildebrandt say to me and Bill this afternoon: &lsquo;Boys, one riddle have I
for you gehabt haben. A young man who cannot riddles antworten, he is not so good by
business for ein family to provide - is not that - hein?&rsquo; And he hands us a riddle - a
conundrum, some calls it - and he chuckles interiorly and gives both of us till to-morrow
morning to work out the answer to it. And he says whichever of us guesses the repartee end
of it goes to his house o&rsquo; Wednesday night to his daughter&rsquo;s birthday party. And it means
Laura for whichever of us goes, for she&rsquo;s naturally aching for a husband, and it&rsquo;s either me or
Bill Watson, for old Hildebrant likes us both, and wants her to marry somebody that&rsquo;ll carry
on the business after he&rsquo;s stitched his last pair of traces.
&ldquo;The riddle? Why, it was this: &lsquo;What kind of a hen lays the longest? Think of that! What
kind of a hen lays the longest? Ain&rsquo;t it like a Dutchman to risk a man&rsquo;s happiness on a fool
proposition like that? Now, what&rsquo;s the use? What I don&rsquo;t know about hens would fill several
incubators. You say you&rsquo;re giving imitations of the old Arab guy that gave away - libraries in
Bagdad. Well, now, can you whistle up a fairy that&rsquo;ll solve this hen query, or not?&rdquo;
When the young man ceased the Margrave arose and paced to and fro by the park
bench for several minutes. Finally he sat again, and said, in grave and impressive tones:
&ldquo;I must confess, sir, that during the eight years that I have spent in search of adventure
and in relieving distress I have never encountered a more interesting or a more perplexing
case. I fear that I have overlooked hens in my researches and observations. As to their habits,
their times and manner of laying, their many varieties and cross-breedings, their span of life,
their -&ldquo;&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t make an Ibsen drama of it!&rdquo; interrupted the young man, flippantly. &ldquo;Riddles -
especially old Hildebrant&rsquo;s riddles - don&rsquo;t have to be worked out seriously. They are light
themes such as Sim Ford and Harry Thurston Peck like to handle. But, somehow, I can&rsquo;t strike
just the answer. Bill Watson may, and he may not. To-morrow will tell. Well, Your Majesty,
I&rsquo;m glad anyhow that you butted in and whiled the time away. I guess Mr. Al Rashid himself
would have bounced back if one of his constituents had conducted him up against this riddle.
I&rsquo;ll say good night. Peace fo&rsquo; yours, and what-you-may-call-its of Allah.&rdquo;
The Margrave, still with a gloomy air, held out his hand.
&ldquo;I cannot exppress my regret,&rdquo; he said, sadly. &ldquo;Never before have I found myself unable
to assist in some way. &lsquo;What kind of a hen lays the longest? It is a baffling problem. There is a
hen, I believe, called the Plymouth Rock that -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cut it out,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;The Caliph trade is a mighty serious one. I don&rsquo;t
suppose you&rsquo;d even see anything funny in a preacher&rsquo;s defense of John D. Rockefeller. Well,
good night, Your Nibs.&rdquo;
From habit the Margrave began to fumble in his pockets. He drew forth a card and
handed it to the young man.
&ldquo;Do me the favor to accept this, anyhow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The time may come when it might
be of use to you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; said the young man, pocketing it carelessly. &ldquo;My name is Simmons.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>Shame to him who would hint that the reader&rsquo;s interest shall altogether pursue the
Margrave August Michael von Paulsen Quigg. I am indeed astray if my hand fail in keeping
the way where my peruser&rsquo;s heart would follow. Then let us, on the morrow, peep quickly in
at the door of Hildebrant, harness maker.
Hildebrant&rsquo;s 200 pounds reposed on a bench, silverbuckling a raw leather martingale.
Bill Watson came in first.
&ldquo;Vell,&rdquo; said Hildebrant, shaking all over with the vile conceit of the joke-maker, &ldquo;haf you
guessed him? &lsquo;Vat kind of a hen lays der longest?&rsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Er - why, I think so,&rdquo; said Bill, rubbing a servile chin. &ldquo;I think so, Mr. Hildebrant - the
one that lives the longest - Is that right?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nein!&rdquo; said Hildebrant, shaking his head violently. &ldquo;You haf not guessed der answer.&ldquo;Bill passed on and donned a bed-tick apron and bachelorhood.
In came the young man of the Arabian Night&rsquo;s fiasco - pale, melancholy, hopeless.
&ldquo;Vell,&rdquo; said Hildebrant, &ldquo;haf you guessed him? &lsquo;Vat kind of a hen lays der longest?&rsquo;&rdquo;
Simmons regarded him with dull savagery in his eye. Should he curse this mountain of
pernicious humor - curse him and die? Why should - But there was Laura.
Dogged, speechless, he thrust his hands into his coat pockets and stood. His hand
encountered the strange touch of the Margrave&rsquo;s card. He drew it out and looked at it, as
men about to be hanged look at a crawling fly. There was written on it in Quigg&rsquo;s bold, round
hand: &ldquo;Good for one roast chicken to bearer.&rdquo;
Simmons looked up with a flashing eye.
&ldquo;A dead one!&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Goot!&rdquo; roared Hildebrant, rocking the table with giant glee. &ldquo;Dot is right! You gome at
mine house at 8 o&rsquo;clock to der party.&rdquo;
A Blackjack Bargainer （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The most disreputable thing in Yancey Goree&rsquo;s law office was Goree himself, sprawled
in his creakv old arm- chair. The rickety little office, built of red brick, was set flush with the
street &ndash; the main street of the town of Bethel.
Bethel rested upon the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge. Above it the mountains were piled
to the sky. Far below it the turbid Catawba gleamed yellow along its disconsolate valley.
The June day was at its sultriest hour. Bethel dozed in the tepid shade. Trade was not. It
was so still that Goree, reclining in his chair, distinctly heard the clicking of the chips in the
grand-jury room, where the &ldquo;court- house gang&rdquo; was playing poker. From the open back
door of the office a well-worn path meandered across the grassy lot to the court-house. The
treading out of that path had cost Goree all he ever had &ndash; first inheritance of a few thousand
dollars, next the old family home, and, latterly the last shreds of his self-respect and
manhood. The &ldquo;gang&rdquo; had cleaned him out. The broken gambler had turned drunkard and
parasite; he had lived to see this day come when the men who had stripped him denied him
a seat at the game. His word was no longer to be taken. The daily bouts at cards had
arranged itself accordingly, and to him was assigned the ignoble part of the onlooker. Thesheriff, the county clerk, a sportive deputy, a gay attorney, and a chalk-faced man hailing
&ldquo;from the valley,&rdquo; sat at table, and the sheared one was thus tacitly advised to go and grow
more wool.
Soon wearying of his ostracism, Goree had departed for his office, muttering to himself
as he unsteadily tra- versed the unlucky pathway. After a drink of corn whiskey from a
demijohn under the table, he had flung himself into the chair, staring, in a sort of maudlin
apathy, out at the mountains immersed in the summer haze. The little white patch he saw
away up on the side of Blackjack was Laurel, the village near which he had been born and
bred. There, also, was the birthplace of the feud between the Gorees and the Coltranes.
Now no direct heir of the Gorees survived except this plucked and singed bird of misfortune.
To the Coltranes, also, but one male supporter was left &ndash; Colonel Abner Col- trane, a man of
substance and standing, a member of the State Legislature, and a contemporary with
Goree&rsquo;s father. The feud had been a typical one of the region; it had left a red record of hate,
wrong and slaughter. But Yancey Goree was not thinking of feuds. His befuddled brain was
hopelessly attacking the problem of the future maintenance of himself and his favourite
follies. Of late, old friends of the family had seen to it that he had whereof to eat and a place
to sleep &ndash; but whiskey they would not buy for him, and he must have whiskey. His law
business was extinct; no case had been intrusted to him in two years. He had been a
borrower and a sponge, and it seemed that if he fell no lower it would be from lack of
opportunity. One more chance &ndash; he was saying to himself &ndash; if he had one more stake at the
game, he thought he could win; but he had nothing left to sell, and his credit was more than
exhausted.
He could not help smiling, even in his misery, as he thought of the man to whom, six
months before, he had sold the old Goree homestead. There had come from &ldquo;back yan&rsquo;&rdquo; in
the mountains two of the strangest creatures, a man named Pike Garvey and his wife. &ldquo;Back
yan&rsquo;,&rdquo; with a wave of the hand toward the hills, was understood among the mountaineers to
designate the remotest fastnesses, the unplumbed gorges, the haunts of lawbreakers, the
wolf&rsquo;s den, and the boudoir of the bear. In the cabin far up on Blackjack&rsquo;s shoulder, in the
wildest part of these retreats, this odd couple had lived for twenty years. They had neither
dog nor children to mitigate the heavy silence of the hills. Pike Garvey was little known in
the settlements, but all who had dealt with him pronounced him &ldquo;crazy as a loon.&rdquo; He
acknowledged no occupation save that of a squirrel hunter, but he &ldquo;moonshined&rdquo;
occasionally by way of diversion. Once the &ldquo;revenues&rdquo; had dragged him from his lair, fighting
silently and desperately like a terrier, and he had been sent to state&rsquo;s prison for two years.
Released, he popped back into his hole like an angry weasel.
Fortune, passing over many anxious wooers, made a freakish flight into Blackjack&rsquo;s
bosky pockets to smile upon Pike and his faithful partner.
One day a party of spectacled, knickerbockered, and altogether absurd prospectors
invaded the vicinity of the Garvey&rsquo;s cabin. Pike lifted his squirrel rifle off the hooks and took
a shot at them at long range on the chance of their being revenues. Happily he missed, andthe unconscious agents of good luck drew nearer, disclosing their innocence of anything
resembling law or justice. Later on, they offered the Garveys an enormous quantity of ready,
green, crisp money for their thirty-acre patch of cleared land, mentioning, as an excuse for
such a mad action, some irrelevant and inadequate nonsense about a bed of mica
underlying the said property.
When the Garveys became possessed of so many dol- lars that they faltered in
computing them, the deficiencies of life on Blackjack began to grow prominent. Pike began
to talk of new shoes, a hogshead of tobacco to set in the corner, a new lock to his rifle; and,
leading Martella to a certain spot on the mountain-side, he pointed out to her how a small
cannon &ndash; doubtless a thing not beyond the scope of their fortune in price &ndash; might be
planted so as to command and defend the sole accessible trail to the cabin, to the confusion
of revenues and meddling strangers forever.
But Adam reckoned without his Eve. These things represented to him the applied
power of wealth, but there slumbered in his dingy cabin an ambition that soared far above
his primitive wants. Somewhere in Mrs. Garvey&rsquo;s bosom still survived a spot of femininity
unstarved by twenty years of Blackjack. For so long a time the sounds in her ears had been
the scaly-barks dropping in the woods at noon, and the wolves singing among the rocks at
night, and it was enough to have purged her of vanities. She had grown fat and sad and
yellow and dull. But when the means came, she felt a rekindled desire to assume the
perquisites of her sex &ndash; to sit at tea tables; to buy futile things; to whitewash the hideous
veracity of life with a little form and ceremony. So she coldly vetoed Pike&rsquo;s proposed system
of fortifica- tions, and announced that thev would descend upon the world, and gyrate
socially.
And thus, at length, it was decided, and the thing done. The village of Laurel was their
compromise between Mrs. Garvey&rsquo;s preference for one of the large valley towns and Pike&rsquo;s
hankering for primeval solitudes. Laurel yielded a halting round of feeble social distractions
omportable with Martella&rsquo;s ambitions, and was not entirely without recommendation to
Pike, its contiguity to the mountains presenting advantages for sudden retreat in case
fashionable society should make it advisable.
Their descent upon Laurel had been coincident with Yancey Goree&rsquo;s feverish desire to
convert property into cash, and they bought the old Goree homestead, paying four thousand
dollars ready money into the spendthrift&rsquo;s shaking hands.
Thus it happened that while the disreputable last of the Gorees sprawled in his
disreputable office, at the end of his row, spurned by the cronies whom he had gorged,
strangers dwelt in the halls of his fathers.
A cloud of dust was rolling, slowly up the parched street, with something travelling in
the midst of it. A little breeze wafted the cloud to one side, and a new, brightly painted
carryall, drawn by a slothful gray horse, became visible. The vehicle deflected from themiddle of the street as it neared Goree&rsquo;s office, and stopped in the gutter directly in front of
his door.
On the front seat sat a gaunt, tall man, dressed in black broadcloth, his rigid hands
incarcerated in yellow kid gloves. On the back seat was a lady who triumphed over the June
heat. Her stout form was armoured in a skintight silk dress of the description known as
&ldquo;change- able,&rdquo; being a gorgeous combination of shifting hues. She sat erect, waving a
much-omamented fan, with her eyes fixed stonily far down the street. However Martella
Garvey&rsquo;s heart might be rejoicing at the pleasures of her new life, Blackjack had done his
work with her exterior. He had carved her countenance to the image of emptiness and
inanity; had imbued her with the stolidity of his crags, and the reserve of his hushed
interiors. She always seemed to hear, whatever her surroundings were, the scaly-barks
falling and pattering down the mountain- side. She could always hear the awful silence of
Black- jack sounding through the stillest of nights.
Goree watched this solemn equipage, as it drove to his door, with only faint interest;
but when the lank driver wrapped the reins about his whip, awkwardly descended, and
stepped into the office, he rose unsteadily to receive him, recognizing Pike Garvey, the new,
the transformed, the recently civilized.
The mountaineer took the chair Goree offered him. They who cast doubts upon
Garvey&rsquo;s soundness of mind had a strong witness in the man&rsquo;s countenance. His face was
too long, a dull saffron in hue, and immobile as a statue&rsquo;s. Pale-blue, unwinking round eyes
without lashes added to the singularity of his gruesome visage. Goree was at a loss to
account for the visit.
&ldquo;Everything all right at Laurel, Mr. Garvey?&rdquo; he inquired.
&ldquo;Everything all right, sir, and mighty pleased is Missis Garvey and me with the property.
Missis Garvey likes yo&rsquo; old place, and she likes the neighbourhood. Society is what she &lsquo;lows
she wants, and she is gettin&rsquo; of it. The Rogerses, the Hapgoods, the Pratts and the Troys hev
been to see Missis Garvey, and she hev et meals to most of thar houses. The best folks hev
axed her to differ&rsquo;nt kinds of doin&rsquo;s. I cyan&rsquo;t say, Mr. Goree, that sech things suits me &ndash; fur
me, give me them thar.&rdquo; Garvey&rsquo;s huge, yellow-gloved hand flourished in the direction of the
mountains. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s whar I b&rsquo;long, &lsquo;mongst the wild honey bees and the b&rsquo;ars. But that ain&rsquo;t
what I come fur to say, Mr. Goree. Thar&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; you got what me and Missis Garvey
wants to buy.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Buy!&rdquo; echoed Goree. &ldquo;From me?&rdquo; Then he laughed harshly. &ldquo;I reckon you are mistaken
about that. I reckon you are mistaken about that. I sold out to you, as you yourself expressed
it, &lsquo;lock, stock and barrel.&rsquo; There isn&rsquo;t even a ramrod left to sell.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it; and we &lsquo;uns want it. &lsquo;Take the money,&rsquo; says Missis Garvey, &lsquo;and buy it fa&rsquo;r
and squared&rsquo;.&lsquo;&ldquo;Goree shook his head. &ldquo;The cupboard&rsquo;s bare,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve riz,&rdquo; pursued the mountaineer, undetected from his object, &ldquo;a heap. We was
pore as possums, and now we could hev folks to dinner every day. We been recognized,
Missis Garvey says, by the best society. But there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; we need we ain&rsquo;t got. She says
it ought to been put in the &lsquo;ventory ov the sale, but it tain&rsquo;t thar. &lsquo;Take the money, then,&rsquo; says
she, &lsquo;and buy it fa&rsquo;r and squar&rsquo;.&ldquo;&rsquo;
&ldquo;Out with it,&rdquo; said Goree, his racked nerves growing impatient.
Garvey threw his slouch bat upon the table, and leaned forward, fixing his unblinking
eves upon Goree&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a old feud,&rdquo; he said distinctly and slowly, &ldquo;&lsquo;tween you &lsquo;uns and the Coltranes.&rdquo;
Goree frowned ominously. To speak of his feud to a feudist is a serious breach of the
mountain etiquette. The man from &ldquo;back yan&rsquo;&rdquo; knew it as well as the lawyer did.
&ldquo;Na offense,&rdquo; he went on &ldquo;but purely in the way of business. Missis Garvey hev studied
all about feuds. Most of the quality folks in the mountains hev &lsquo;em. The Settles and the
Goforths, the Rankins and the Boyds, the Silers and the Galloways, hev all been cyarin&rsquo; on
feuds f&rsquo;om twenty to a hundred year. The last man to drap was when yo&rsquo; uncle, Jedge Paisley
Goree, &lsquo;journed co&rsquo;t and shot Len Coltrane f&rsquo;om the bench. Missis Garvey and me, we come
f&rsquo;om the po&rsquo; white trash. Nobody wouldn&rsquo;t pick a feud with we &lsquo;uns, no mo&rsquo;n with a fam&rsquo;ly of
tree-toads. Quality people everywhar, says Missis Garvey, has feuds. We &lsquo;uns ain&rsquo;t quality,
but we&rsquo;re uyin&rsquo; into it as fur as we can. &lsquo;Take the money, then,&rsquo; says Missis Garvey, &lsquo;and buy
Mr. Goree&rsquo;s feud, fa&rsquo;r and squar&rsquo;.&lsquo;&rdquo;
The squirrel hunter straightened a leg half across the room, drew a roll of bills from his
pocket, and threw them on the table.
&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s two hundred dollars, Mr. Goree; what you would call a fa&rsquo;r price for a feud that&rsquo;s
been &lsquo;lowed to run down like yourn hev. Thar&rsquo;s only you left to cyar&rsquo; on yo&rsquo; side of it, and
you&rsquo;d make mighty po&rsquo; killin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll take it off yo&rsquo; hands, and it&rsquo;ll set me and Missis Garvey up
among the quality. Thar&rsquo;s the money.&rdquo;
The little roll of currency on the table slowly untwisted itself, writhing and jumping as
its folds relaxed. In the silence that followed Garvey&rsquo;s last speech the rattling of the poker
chips in the court-house could be plainly heard. Goree knew that the sheriff had just won a
pot, for the subdued whoop with which he always greeted a victory floated across the
sqquare upon the crinkly heat waves. Beads of moisture stood on Goree&rsquo;s brow. Stooping,
he drew the wicker-covered demijohn from under the table, and filled a tumbler from it.&ldquo;A little corn liquor, Mr. Garvey? Of course you are joking about what you spoke of?
Opens quite a new market, doesn&rsquo;t it? Feuds. Prime, two-fifty to three. Feuds, slightly
damaged &ndash; two hundred, I believe you said, Mr. Garvey?&rdquo;
Goree laughed self-consciously.
The mountaineer took the glass Goree handed him, and drank the whisky without a
tremor of the lids of his staring eyes. The lawyer applauded the feat by a look of envious
admiration. He poured his own drink, and took it like a drunkard, by gulps, and with
shudders at the smell and taste.
&ldquo;Two hundred,&rdquo; repeated Garvey. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s the money.&rdquo;
A sudden passion flared up in Goree&rsquo;s brain. He struck the table with his fist. One of the
bills flipped over and touched his hand. He flinched as if something had stung him.
&ldquo;Do you come to me,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;seriously with such a ridiculous, insulting,
darned-fool proposition?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fa&rsquo;r and squar&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the squirrel hunter, but he reached out his hand as if to take
back the money; and then Goree knew that his own flurry of rage had not been from pride
or resentment, but from anger at himself, knowing that he would set foot in the deeper
depths that were being opened to him. He turned in an instant from an outraged gentleman
to an anxious chafferer recom- mending his goods.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry, Garvey,&rdquo; he said, his face crimson and his speech thick. &ldquo;I accept
your p-p-proposition, though it&rsquo;s dirt cheap at two hundred. A t-trade&rsquo;s all right when both
p-purchaser and b-buyer are s-satisfied. Shall I w-wrap it up for you, Mr. Garvey?&rdquo;
Garvey rose, and shook out his broadcloth. &ldquo;Missis Garvev will be pleased. You air out
of it, and it stands Coltrane and Garvey. Just a scrap ov writin&rsquo;, Mr. Goree, you bein&rsquo; a lawyer,
to show we traded.&rdquo;
Goree seized a sheet of paper and a pen. The money was clutched in his moist hand.
Everything else sud- denly seemed to grow trivial and light.
&ldquo;Bill of sale, by all means. &lsquo;Right, title, and interest in and to&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;forever warrant and &ndash;
&lsquo; No, Garvey, we&rsquo;ll have to leave out that &lsquo;defend,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Goree with a loud laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have
to defend this title yourself.&rdquo;
The mountaineer received the amazing screed that the lawyer handed him, folded it
with immense labour, and laced it carefully in his pocket.Goree was standing near the window. &ldquo;Step here, said, raising his finger, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll show
you your recently purchased enemy. There he goes, down the other side of the street.&rdquo;
The mountaineer crooked his long frame to look through the window in the direction
indicated by the other. Colonel Abner Coltrane, an erect, portly gentleman of about fifty,
wearing the inevitable long, double-breasted frock coat of the Southern lawmaker, and an
old high silk hat, was passing on the opposite sidewalk. As Garvey looked, Goree glanced at
his face. If there be such a thing as a yellow wolf, here was its counterpart. Garvey snarled as
his unhuman eyes followed the moving figure, disclosing long, amber-coloured fangs.
&ldquo;Is that him? Why, that&rsquo;s the man who sent me to the penitentiary once!&rdquo;
&ldquo;He used to be district attorney,&rdquo; said Goree care- lessly. &ldquo;And, by the way, he&rsquo;s a
first-class shot.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I kin hit a squirrel&rsquo;s eye at a hundred yard,&rdquo; said Garvey. &ldquo;So that thar&rsquo;s Coltrane! I
made a better trade than I was thinkin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll take keer ov this feud, Mr. Goree, better&rsquo;n you
ever did!&rdquo;
He moved toward the door, but lingered there, betray- ing a slight perplexity.
&ldquo;Anything else to-day?&rdquo; inquired Goree with frothy sarcasm. &ldquo;Any family traditions,
ancestral ghosts, or skeletons in the closet? Prices as low as the lowest.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thar was another thing,&rdquo; replied the unmoved squirrel hunter, &ldquo;that Missis Garvey was
thinkin&rsquo; of. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t so much in my line as t&rsquo;other, but she wanted partic&rsquo;lar that I should
inquire, and ef you was willin&rsquo;, &lsquo;pay fur it,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;fa&rsquo;r and squar&rsquo;.&rsquo; Thar&rsquo;s a buryin&rsquo; groun&rsquo;,
as you know, Mr. Goree, in the yard of yo&rsquo; old place, under the cedars. Them that lies thar is
yo&rsquo; folks what was killed by the Coltranes. The monyments has the names on &lsquo;em. Missis
Garvev says a fam&rsquo;ly buryin&rsquo; groun&rsquo;- is a sho&rsquo; sign of quality. She says ef we git the feud thar&rsquo;s
somethin&rsquo; else ought to go with it. The names on them moiivments is &lsquo;Goree,&rsquo; but they can
be changed to ourn by &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Go. Go!&rdquo; screamed Goree, his face turning purple. He stretched out both hands
toward the mountaineer, his fingers hooked and shaking. &ldquo;Go, you ghoul! Even a
Ch-Chinaman protects the g-graves of his ancestors &ndash; go!&rdquo;
The squirrel hunter slouched out of the door to his carryall. While he was climbing over
the wheel Goree was collecting, with feverish celerity, the money that had fallen from his
hand to the floor. As the vehicle slowly turned about, the sheep, with a coat of newly grown
wool, was hurrying, in indecent haste, along the path to the court-house.At three o&rsquo;clock in the morning they brought him back to his office, shorn and
unconscious. The sheriff, the sportive deputy, the county clerk, and the gay attorney carried
him, the chalk-faced man &ldquo;from the valley&rdquo; acting as escort.
&ldquo;On the table,&rdquo; said one of them, and they deposited him there among the litter of his
unprofitable books and papers.
&ldquo;Yance thinks a lot of a pair of deuces when he&rsquo;s liquored up,&rdquo; sighed the sheriff
reflectively.
&ldquo;Too much,&rdquo; said the gay attorney. &ldquo;A man has no business to play poker who drinks as
much as he does. I wonder how much he dropped to-night.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Close to two hundred. What I wonder is whar he got it. Yance ain&rsquo;t had a cent fur over
a month, I know.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Struck a client, maybe. Well, let&rsquo;s get home before daylight. He&rsquo;ll be all right when he
wakes up, except for a sort of beehive about the cranium.&rdquo;
The gang slipped away through the early morning twilight. The next eye to gaze upon
the miserable Goree was the orb of day. He peered through the uncurtained window, first
deluging the sleeper in a flood of faint gold, but soon pouring upon the mottled red of his
flesh a searching, white, summer heat. Goree stirred, half unconsciously, among the table&rsquo;s
débris, and turned his face from the window. His movement dislodged a heavy law book,
which crashed upon the floor. Opening his eyes, he saw, bending over him, a man in a black
frock coat. Looking higher, he discovered a well-worn silk hat, and beneath it the kindly,
smooth face of Colonel Abner Coltrane.
A little uncertain of the outcome, the colonel waited for the other to make some sign of
recognition. Not in twenty years had male members of these two families faced each other
in peace. Goree&rsquo;s eyelids puckered as he strained his blurred sight toward this visitor, and
then he smiled serenely.
&ldquo;Have you brought Stella and Lucy over to play?&rdquo; he said calmly.
&ldquo;Do you know me, Yancey?&rdquo; asked Coltrane.
&ldquo;Of course I do. You brought me a whip with a whistle in the end.&rdquo;
So he had &ndash; twenty-four years ago; when Yancey&rsquo;s father was his best friend.
Goree&rsquo;s eyes wandered about the room. The colonel understood. &ldquo;Lie still, and I&rsquo;ll bring
you some,&rdquo; said he. There was a pump in the yard at the rear, and Goree closed his eyes,
listening with rapture to the click of its handle, and the bubbling of the falling stream. Col-trane brought a pitcher of the cool water, and held it for him to drink. Presently Goree sat up
&ndash; a most forlorn object, his summer suit of flax soiled and crumpled, his discreditable head
tousled and unsteady. He tried to wave one of his hands toward the colonel.
&ldquo;Ex-excuse-everything, will you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must have drunk too much whiskey last
night, and gone to bed on the table.&rdquo; His brows knitted into a puzzled frown.
&ldquo;Out with the boys awhile?&rdquo; asked Coltrane kindly.
&ldquo;No, I went nowhere. I haven&rsquo;t had a dollar to spend in the last two months. Struck the
demijohn too often. I reckon, as usual.&rdquo;
Colonel Coltrane touched him on the shoulder.
&ldquo;A little while ago, Yancey,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;you asked me if I had brought Stella and Lucy
over to play. You weren&rsquo;t quite awake then, and must have been dreaming you were a boy
again. You are awake now, and I want you to listen to me. I have come from Stella and Lucy
to their old playmate, and to my old friend&rsquo;s son. They know that I am going to bring you
home with me, and you will find them as ready with a welcome as they were in the old days.
I want you to come to my house and stay until you are yourself aain, and as much longer as
you will. We heard of your being down in the world, and in the midst of temptation, and we
agreed that you should come over and play at our house once more. Will you come, my boy?
Will you drop our old family trouble and come with me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Trouble!&rdquo; said Goree, opening his eyes wide. &ldquo;There was never any trouble between us
that I know of. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve always been the best friends. But, good Lord, Colonel, how
could I go to your home as I am &ndash; a drunken wretch, a miserable, degraded spendthrift and
gambler &ndash; &ldquo;
He lurched from the table into his armchair, and began to weep maudlin tears, mingled
with genuine drops of remorse and shame. Coltrane talked to him persist- ently and
reasonably, reminding him of the simple moun- tain pleasures of which he had once been so
fond, and insisting upon the genuineness of the invitation.
Finally he landed Goree by telling him he was counting upon his help in the engineering
and transportation of a large amount of felled timber from a high mountain-side to a
waterway. He knew that Goree had once invented a device for this purpose &ndash; a series of
slides and chutes- upon which he had justly prided himself. In an instant the poor fellow,
delighted at the idea of his being of use to any one, had paper spread upon the table, and
was drawing rapid but pitifully shaky lines in demonstration of what he could and would do.
The man was sickened of the husks; his prodigal heart was turning again toward the
mountains. His mind was yet strangely clogged, and his thoughts and memories werereturning to his brain one by one, like carrier pigeons over a stormy sea. But Coltrane was
satisfied with the progress he had made.
Bethel received the surprise of its existence that after- noon when a Coltrane and a
Goree rode amicably together through the town. Side by side they rode, out from the dusty
streets and gaping townspeople, down across the creek bridge, and up toward the mountain.
The prodigal had brushed and washed and combed himself to a more decent figure, but he
was unsteady in the saddle, and he seemed to be deep in the contemplation of some vexing
problem. Coltrane left him in his mood, relying upon the influence of changed surroundings
to restore his equilibrium.
Once Goree was seized with a shaking fit, and almost came to a collapse. He had to
dismount and rest at the side of the road. The colonel, foreseeing such a con- dition, had
provided a small flask of whisky for the journey but when it was offered to him Goree
refused it almost with violence, declaring he would never touch it again. By and by he was
recovered, and went quietly enough for a mile or two. Then he pulled up his horse suddenly,
and said:
&ldquo;I lost two hundred dollars last night, playing poker. Now, where did I get that money?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Take it easy, Yancev. The mountain air will soon clear it up. We&rsquo;ll go fishing, first thing,
at the Pinnacle Falls. The trout are jumping there like bullfrogs. We&rsquo;ll take Stella and Lucy
along, and have a picnic on Eagle Rock. Have you forgotten how a hickory-cured-ham
sandwich tastes, Yancey, to a hungry fisherman?&rdquo;
Evidently the colonel did not believe the story of his lost wealth; so Goree retired again
into brooding silence.
By late Afternoon they had travelled ten of the twelve miles between Bethel and Laurel.
Half a mile this side of Laurel lay the old Goree place; a mile or two beyond the village lived
the Coltranes. The road was now steep and laborious, but the compensations were many.
The tilted aisles of the forest were opulent with leaf and bird and bloom. The tonic air put to
shame the pharma- cop?ia. The glades were dark with mossy shade, and bright with shy
rivulets winking from the ferns and laurels. On the lower side they viewed, framed in the
near foilage, exquisite sketches of the far valley swooning in its opal haze.
Coltrane was pleased to see that his companion was yielding to the spell of the hills and
woods. For now they had but to skirt the base of Painter&rsquo;s Cliff; to cross Elder Branch and
mount the hill beyond, and Goree would have to face the squandered home of his fathers.
Every rock he passed, every tree, every foot of the rocky way, was familiar to him. Though he
hid forgotten the woods, they thrilled him like the music of &ldquo;Home, Sweet Home.&rdquo;
They rounded the cliff, decended into Elder Branch, and paused there to let the horses
drink and splash in the swift water. On the right was a rail fence that cornered there, andfollowed the road and stream. Inclosed by it was the old apple orchard of the home place;
the house was yet concealed by the brow of the steep hill. Inside and along the fence,
pokeberries, elders, sassafras, and sumac grew high and dense. At a rustle of their branches,
both Goree and Coltrane glanced up, and saw a long, yellow, wolfish face above the fence,
staring at them with pale, unwinking eyes. The head quicky disappeared; there was a violent
swaying of the bushes, and an ungainly figure ran up through the apple orchard in the
direction of the house, zigzagging among the trees.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Garvey,&rdquo; said Coltrane; &ldquo;the man you sold out to. There&rsquo;s no doubt but he&rsquo;s
considerably cracked. I had to send him up for moonshining, once, several years ago, in spite
of the fact that I believed him irresponsible. Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, Yancey?&rdquo;
Goree was wiping his forehead, and his face had lost its colour. &ldquo;Do I look queer, too?&rdquo;
he asked, trying to smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just remembering a few more things.&rdquo; Some of the alcohol
had evaporated from his brain. &ldquo;I recollect now where I got that two hundred dollars.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of it,&rdquo; said Coltrane cheerfully. &ldquo;Later on we&rsquo;ll figure it all out together.&rdquo;
They rode out of the branch, and when they reached the foot of the hill Goree stopped
again.
&ldquo;Did you ever suspect I was a very vain kind of fellow, Colonel&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Sort of foolish
proud about appearances?&rdquo;
The colonel&rsquo;s eyes refused to wander to the soiled, sag- ging suit of flax and the faded
slouch hat.
&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he replied, mystified, but humouring him, &ldquo;I remember a young buck
about twenty, with the tightest coat, the sleekest hair, and the prancingest saddle horse in
the Blue Ridge.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said Goree eagerly. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s in me yet, though it don&rsquo;t show. Oh, I&rsquo;m as
vain as a turkey gobbler, and as proud as Lucifer. I&rsquo;m going to ask you to indulge this
weakness of mine in a little matter.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Speak out, Yancey. We&rsquo;ll create you Duke of Laurel and Baron of Blue Ridge, if you
choose; and you shall have a feather out of Stella&rsquo;s peacock&rsquo;s tail to wear in your hat.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in earnest. In a few minutes we&rsquo;ll pass the house up there on the hill where I was
born, and where my people have lived for nearly a century. Strangers live there now &ndash; and
look at me! I am about to show myself to them ragged and poverty-stricken, a wastrel and a
beggar. Colonel Coltrane, I&rsquo;m ashamed to do it. I want you to let me wear your coat and hat
until we are out of sight beyond. I know you think it a foolish pride, but I want to make as
good a showing as I can when I pass the old place.&ldquo;&ldquo;Now, what does this mean?&rdquo; said Coltrane to him- self, as he compared his
companion&rsquo;s sane looks and quiet demeanour with his strange request. But he was already
unbuttoning the coat, assenting readily, as if the fancy were in no wise to be considered
strange.
The coat and hat fitted Goree well. He buttoned the former about him with a look of
satisfaction and dignity. He and Coltrane were nearly the same size &ndash; rather tall, portly, and
erect. Twenty-five years were between them, but in appearance they might have been
brothers. Goree looked older than his age; his face was puffy and lined; the colonel had the
smooth, fresh complexion of a temperate liver. He put on Goree&rsquo;s disreputable old flax coat
and faded slouch hat.
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Goree, taking up the reins, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right. I want you to ride about ten feet in
the rear as we go by, Colonel, so that they can get a good look at me. They&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;m no back
number yet, by any means. I guess I&rsquo;ll show up pretty well to them once more, any- how.
Let&rsquo;s ride on.&rdquo;
He set out up the hill at a smart trot, the colonel fol- lowing, as he had been requested.
Goree sat straight in the saddle, with head erect, but his eyes were turned to the right,
sharply scanning every shrub and fence and hiding-place in the old homestead yard. Once he
muttered to himself, &ldquo;Will the crazy fool try it, or did I dream half of it?&rdquo;
It was when he came opposite the little family burying ground that he saw what he had
been looking for &ndash; a puff of white smoke, coming from the thick cedars in one comer. He
toppled so slowly to the left that Coltrane had time to urge his horse to that side, and catch
him with one arm.
The squirrel hunter had not overpraised his aim. He had sent the bullet where he
intended, and where Goree had expected that it would pass - through the breast of Colonel
Abner Coltrane&rsquo;s black frock coat.
Goree leaned heavily against Coltrane, but he did not fall. The horses kept pace, side by
side, and the Colonel&rsquo;s arm kept him steady. The little white houses of Laurel shone through
the trees, half a mile away. Goree reached out one hand and groped until it rested upon
Coltrane&rsquo;s fingers, which held his bridle.
&ldquo;Good friend,&rdquo; he said, and that was all.
Thus did Yancey Goree, as be rode past his old home, make, considering all things, the
best showing that was in his power.Blind Man&rsquo;s Holiday （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Alas for the man and for the artist with the shifting point of perspective! Life shall be a
confusion of ways to the one; the landscape shall rise up and confound the other. Take the
case of Lorison. At one time he appeared to himself to be the feeblest of fools; at another he
conceived that he followed ideals so fine that the world was not yet ready to accept them.
During one mood he cursed his folly; possessed by the other, he bore himself with a serene
grandeur akin to greatness: in neither did he attain the perspective.
Generations before, the name had been &ldquo;Larsen.&rdquo; His race had bequeathed him its
fine-strung, melancholy temperament, its saving balance of thrift and industry.
From his point of perspective he saw himself an outcast from society, forever to be a
shady skulker along the ragged edge of respectability; a denizen des trois-quartz de monde,
that pathetic spheroid lying between the haut and the demi, whose inhabitants envy each of
their neigh- bours, and are scorned by both. He was self-condemned to this opinion, as he
was self-exiled, through it, to this quaint Southern city a thousand miles from his former
home. Here he had dwelt for longer than a year, know- ing but few, keeping in a subjective
world of shadows which was invaded at times by the perplexing bulks of jarring realities.
Then he fell in love with a girl whom he met in a cheap restaurant, and his story begins.
The Rue Chartres, in New Orleans, is a street of ghosts. It lies in the quarter where the
Frenchman, in his prime, set up his translated pride and glory; where, also, the arrogant don
had swaggered, and dreamed of gold and grants and ladies&rsquo; gloves. Every flagstone has its
grooves worn by footsteps going royally to the wooing and the fighting. Every house has a
princely heartbreak; each doorway its untold tale of gallant promise and slow decay.
By night the Rue Chartres is now but a murky fissure, from which the groping wayfarer
sees, flung against the sky, the tangled filigree of Moorish iron balconies. Ths old houses of
monsieur stand yet, indomitable against the century, but their essence is gone. The street is
one of ghosts to whosoever can see them.
A faint heartbeat of the street&rsquo;s ancient glory still sur- vives in a corner occupied by the
Café Carabine d&rsquo;Or. Once men gathered there to plot against kings, and to warn presidents.
They do so yet, but they are not the same kind of men. A brass button will scatter these;
those would have set their faces against an army. Above the door hangs the sign board,
upon which has been depicted a vast animal of unfamiliar species. In the act of firing upon
this monster is represented an unobtrusive human levelling an obtrusive gun, once the
colour of bright gold. Now the legend above the picture is faded beyond conjecture; the
gun&rsquo;s relation to the title is a matter of faith; the menaced animal, wearied of the long aim
of the hunter, has resolved itself into a shapeless blot.The place is known as &ldquo;Antonio&rsquo;s,&rdquo; as the name, white upon the red-lit transparency,
and gilt upon the windows, attests. There is a promise in &ldquo;Antonio&rdquo;; a justifiable expectancy
of savoury things in oil and pepper and wine, and perhaps an angel&rsquo;s whisper of garlic. But
the rest of the name is &ldquo;O&rsquo;Riley.&rdquo; Antonio O&rsquo;Riley!
The Carabine d&rsquo;Or is an ignominious ghost of the Rue Chartres. The café where Bienville
and Conti dined, where a prince has broken bread, is become a &ldquo;family ristaurant.&rdquo;
Its customers are working men and women, almost to a unit. Occasionally you will see
chorus girls from the cheaper theatres, and men who follow avocations sub- ject to quick
vicissitudes; but at Antonio&rsquo;s &ndash; name rich in Bohemian promise, but tame in fulfillment &ndash;
manners debonair and gay are toned down to the &ldquo;family&rdquo; stand- ard. Should you light a
cigarette, mine host will touch you on the &ldquo;arrum&rdquo; and remind you that the proprieties are
menaced. &ldquo;Antonio&rdquo; entices and beguiles from fiery legend without, but &ldquo;O&rsquo;Riley&rdquo; teaches
decorum within.
It was at this restaurant that Lorison first saw the girl. A flashy fellow with a predatory
eye had followed her in, and had advanced to take the other chair at the little table where
she stopped, but Lorison slipped into the seat before him. Their acquaintance began, and
grew, and how for two months they had sat at the same table each evening, not meeting by
appointment, but as if by a series of fortuitous and happy accidents. After dining, they would
take a walk together in one of the little city parks, or among the panoramic markets where
exhibits a con- tinuous vaudeville of sights and sounds. Always at eight o&rsquo;clock their steps led
them to a certain street corner, where she prettily but firmly bade him good night and left
him. &ldquo;I do not live far from here,&rdquo; she frequently said, &ldquo;and you must let me go the rest of
the way alone.&rdquo;
But now Lorison had discovered that he wanted to go the rest of the way with her, or
happiness would depart, leaving, him on a very lonely corner of life. And at the same time
that he made the discovery, the secret of his banishment from the society of the good laid
its finger in his face and told him it must not be.
Man is too thoroughly an egoist not to be also an egotist; if he love, the object shall
know it. During a lifetime he may conceal it through stress of expediency and honour, but it
shall bubble from his dying lips, though it disrupt a neighbourhood. It is known, however,
that most men do not wait so long to disclose their passion. In the case of Lorison, his
particular ethics positively forbade him to declare his sentiments, but he must needs dally
with the subject, and woo by innuendo at least.
On this night, after the usual meal at the Carabine d&rsquo;Or, he strolled with his companion
down the dim old street toward the riverThe Rue Chartres perishes in the old Place d&rsquo;Armes. The ancient Cabildo, where Spanish
justice fell like hail, faces it, and the Cathedral, another provincial ghost, overlooks it. Its
centre is a little, iron-railed park of flowers and immaculate gravelled walks, where citizens
take the air of evenings. Pedestalled high above it, the general sits his cavorting steed, with
his face turned stonily down the river toward English Turn, whence come no more Britons to
bombard his cotton bales.
Often the two sat in this square, but to-night Lorison guided her past the stone-stepped
gate, and still riverward. As they walked, he smiled to himself to think that all he knew of her
&ndash; except that be loved her &ndash; was her name, Norah Greenway, and that she lived with her
brother. They had talked about everything except themselves. Perhaps her reticence had
been caused by his.
They came, at length, upon the levee, and sat upon a great, prostrate beam. The air
was pungent with the dust of commerce. The great river slipped yellowly past. Across it
Algiers lay, a longitudinous black bulk against a vibrant electric haze sprinkled with exact
stars.
The girl was young and of the piquant order. A certain bright melancholy pervaded her;
she possessed an untarnished, pale prettiness doomed to please. Her voice, when she spoke,
dwarfed her theme. It was the voice capable of investing little subjects with a large interest.
She sat at ease, bestowing her skirts with the little womanly touch, serene as if the
begrimed pier were a summer garden. Lorison poked the rotting boards with his cane.
He began by telling her that he was in love with some one to whom he durst not speak
of it. &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; she asked, accepting swiftly his fatuous presentation of a third person
of straw. &ldquo;My place in the world,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;is none to ask a woman to share. I am an
outcast from honest people; I am wrongly accused of one crime, and am, I believe, guilty of
another.&rdquo;
Thence he plunged into the story of his abdication from society. The story, pruned of his
moral philosophy, deserves no more than the slightest touch. It is no new tale, that of the
gambler&rsquo;s declension. During one night&rsquo;s sitting he lost, and then had imperilled a certain
amount of his employer&rsquo;s money, which, by accident, he carried with him. He continued to
lose, to the last wager, and then began to gain, leaving the game winner to a somewhat
formidable sum. The same night his employer&rsquo;s safe was robbed. A search was had; the
winnings of Lorison were found in his room, their total forming an accusative nearness to
the sum purloined. He was taken, tried and, through incomplete evidence, released,
smutched with the sinister devoirs of a dis- agreeing jury.
&ldquo;It is not in the unjust accusation,&rdquo; he said to the girl, &ldquo;that my burden lies, but in the
knowledge that from the moment I staked the first dollar of the firm&rsquo;s money I was acriminal &ndash; no matter whether I lost or won. You see why it is impossible for me to speak of
love to her.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is a sad thing,&rdquo; said Norah, after a little pause. &ldquo;to think what very good people there
are in the world.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Good?&rdquo; said Lorison.
&ldquo;I was thinking of this superior person whom you say you love. She must be a very poor
sort of creature.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I do not understand.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nearly,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;as poor a sort of creature as yourself.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; said Lorison, removing his hat and sweeping back his fine,
light hair. &ldquo;Suppose she loved me in return, and were willing to marry me. Think, if you can,
what would follow. Never a day Would pass but she would be reminded of her sacrifice. I
would read a condescension in her smile, a pity even in her affection, that would madden
me. No. The thing would stand between us forever. Only equals should mate. I could never
ask her to come down upon my lower plane.&rdquo;
An arc light faintly shone upon Lorison&rsquo;s face. An illumination from within also
pervaded it. The girl saw the rapt, ascetic look; it was the face either of Sir Galahad or Sir
Fool.
&ldquo;Quite starlike,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is this unapproachable angel. Really too high to be grasped.&rdquo;
&ldquo;By me, yes.&rdquo;
She faced him suddenly. &ldquo;My dear friend, would you prefer your star fallen?&rdquo; Lorison
made a wide gesture.
&ldquo;You push me to the bald fact,&rdquo; he declared; &ldquo;you are not in sympathy with my
argument. But I will answer you so. If I could reach my particular star, to drag it down, I
would not do it; but if it were fallen, I would pick it up, and thank Heaven for the privilege.&rdquo;
They were silent for some minutes. Norah shivered, and thrust her hands deep into the
pockets of her jacket. Lorison uttered a remorseful exclamation.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not cold,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was just thinking. I ought to tell you something. You have
selected a strange confidante. But you cannot expect a chance acquain- ance, picked up in a
doubtful restaurant, to be an angel.&ldquo;&ldquo;Norah!&rdquo; cried Lorison.
&ldquo;Let me go on. You have told me about yourself. We have been such good friends. I
must tell you now what I never wanted you to know. I am &ndash; worse than you are. I was on the
stage &hellip; I sang in the chorus &hellip; I was pretty bad, I guess &hellip; I stole diamonds from the
prima donna &hellip; they arrested me &hellip; I gave most of them up, and they let me go &hellip; I drank
wine every night &hellip; a great deal &hellip; I was very wicked, but &ndash; &ldquo;
Lorison knelt quickly by her side and took her hands.
&ldquo;Dear Norah!&rdquo; he said, exultantly. &ldquo;It is you, it is you I love! You never guessed it, did
you? &lsquo;Tis you I meant all the time. Now I can speak. Let me make you forget the past. We
have both suffered; let us shut out the world, and live for each other. Norah, do you hear me
say I love you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;In spite of &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Rather say because of it. You have come out of your past noble and good. Your heart is
an angel&rsquo;s, Give it to me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A little while ago you feared the future too much to even speak.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But for you; not for myself. Can you love me?&rdquo;
She cast herself, wildly sobbing, upon his breast.
&ldquo;Better than life &ndash; than truth itself &ndash; than every- thing.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And my own past,&rdquo; said Lorison, with a note of solicitude &ndash; &ldquo;can you forgive and &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;I answered you that,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;when I told you I loved you.&rdquo; She leaned away,
and looked thought- fully at him. &ldquo;If I had not told you about myself, would you have &ndash;
would you &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he interrupted; &ldquo;I would never have let you know I loved you. I would never have
asked you this &ndash; Norah, will you be my wife?&rdquo;
She wept again.
&ldquo;Oh, believe me; I am good now &ndash; I am no longer wicked! I will be the best wife in the
world. Don&rsquo;t think I am &ndash; bad any more. If you do I shall die, I shall die!&ldquo;While he was consoling, her, she brightened up, eager and impetuous. &ldquo;Will vou marry
me to-night?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Will you prove it that way. I have a reason for wishing it to be
to-night. Will you?&rdquo;
Of one of two things was this exceeding frankness the outcome: either of importunate
brazenness or of utter innocence. The lover&rsquo;s perspective contained only the one.
&ldquo;The sooner,&rdquo; said Lorison, &ldquo;the happier I shall be.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What is there to do?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What do you have to get? Come! You should know.&rdquo;
Her energy stirred the dreamer to action.
&ldquo;A city directory first,&rdquo; he cried, gayly, &ldquo;to find where the man lives who gives licenses
to happiness. We will go together and rout him out. Cabs, cars, policemen, telephones and
ministers shall aid us.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Father Rogan shall marry us,&rdquo; said the girl, with ardour. &ldquo;I will take you to him.&rdquo;
An hour later the two stood at the open doorway of an immense, gloomy brick building
in a narrow and lonely street. The license was tight in Norah&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;Wait here a moment,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;till I find Father Rogan.&rdquo;
She plunged into the black hallway, and the lover was left standing, as it were, on one
leg, outside. His impa- tience was not greatly taxed. Gazing curiously into what seemed the
hallway to Erebus, he was presently reassured by a stream of light that bisected the darkness,
far down the passage. Then he heard her call, and fluttered lampward, like the moth. She
beckoned him through a doorway into the room whence emanated the light. The room was
bare of nearly everything except books, which had subjugated all its space. Here and there
little spots of territory had been reconquered. An elderly, bald man, with a superlatively
calm, remote eye, stood by a table with a book in his hand, his finger still marking a page.
His dress was sombre and appertained to a religious order. His eye denoted an acquaintance
with the perspective.
&ldquo;Father Rogan,&rdquo; said Norah, &ldquo;this is he.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The two of ye,&rdquo; said Father Rogan, &ldquo;want to get married?&rdquo;
They did not deny it. He married them. The cere- mony was quickly done. One who
could have witnessed it, and felt its scope, might have trembled at the terrible inadequacy of
it to rise to the dignity of its endless chain of results.Afterward the priest spake briefly, as if by rote, of certain other civil and legal addenda
that either might or should, at a later time, cap the ceremony. Lorison tendered a fee, which
was declined, and before the door closed after the departing couple Father Rogan&rsquo;s book
popped open again where his finger marked it.
In the dark hall Norah whirled and clung to her com- panion, tearful.
&ldquo;Will you never, never be sorry?&rdquo;
At last she was reassured.
At the first light they reached upon the street, she asked the time, just as she had each
night. Lorison looked at his watch. Half-past eight.
Lorison thought it was from habit that she guided their steps toward the corner where
they always parted. But, arrived there, she hesitated, and then released his arm. A drug
store stood on the corner; its bright, soft light shone upon them.
&ldquo;Please leave me here as usual to-night,&rdquo; said Norah, sweetly. &ldquo;I must &ndash; I would rather
you would. You will not object? At six to-morrow evening I will meet you at Antonio&rsquo;s. I want
to sit with vou there once more. And then &ndash; I will go where you say.&rdquo; She gave him a
bewildering, bright smile, and walked swiftly away.
Surely it needed all the strength of her charm to carry off this astounding behaviour. It
was no discredit to Lorison&rsquo;s strength of mind that his head began to whirl. Pocketing his
hands, he rambled vacuously over to the druggist&rsquo;s windows, and began assiduously to spell
over the names of the patent medicines therein displayed.
As soon as be had recovered his wits, he proceeded along the street in an aimless
fashion. After drifting for two or three squares, he flowed into a somewhat more pretentious
thoroughfare, a way much frequented by him in his solitary ramblings. For here was a row of
slops devoted to traffic in goods of the widest range of choice &ndash; handiworks of art, skill and
fancy, products of nature and labour from every zone.
Here, for a time, he loitered among the conspicuous windows, where was set,
emphasized bv congested floods of light, the cunningest spoil of the interiors. There were
few passers, and of this Lorison was glad. He was not of the world. For a long time he had
touched his fellow man only at the gear of a levelled cog-wheel &ndash; at right angles, and upon a
different axis. He had dropped into a distinctly new orbit. The stroke of ill fortune had acted
upon him, in effect, as a blow delivered upon the apex of a certain ingenious toy, the musical
top, which- when thus buffeted while spinning, gives forth, with scarcely retarded motion, a
complete change of key and chord.Strolling along the pacific avenue, he experienced singular, supernatural calm,
accompanied by an unusual a activity of brain. Reflecting upon recent affairs, be assured
himself of his happiness in having won for a bride the one he had so greatly desired, yet he
wondered mildly at his dearth of active emotion. Her strange behaviour in abandoning him
without valid excuse on his bridal eve aroused in him only a vague and curious speculation.
Again, he found himself contemplating, with complaisant serenity, the incidents of her
somewhat lively career. His perspective seemed to have been queerly shifted.
As he stood before a window near a corner, his ears were assailed by a waxing clamour
and commotion. He stood close to the window to allow passage to the cause of the hubbub
&ndash; a procession of human beings, which rounded the corner aid headed in his direction. He
perceived a salient hue of blue and a glitter of brass about a central figure of dazzling white
and silver, and a ragged wake of black, bobbing figures.
Two ponderous policemen Were conducting between them a woman dressed as if for
the stage, in a short, white, satiny skirt reaching to the knees, pink stockings, and a sort of
sleeveless bodice bright with relucent, armour-like scales. Upon her curly, light hair was
perched, at a rollicking angle, a shining tin helmet. The costume was to be instantly
recognized as one of those amazing con- ceptions to which competition has harried the
inventors of the spectacular ballet. One of the officers bore a long cloak upon his axm, which,
doubtless, had been intended to veil the I candid attractions of their effulgent prisoner, but,
for some reason, it had not been called into use, to the vociferous delight of the tail of the
procession.
Compelled by a sudden and vigorous movement of the woman, the parade halted
before the window by which Lorison stood. He saw that she was young, and, at the first
glance, was deceived by a sophistical prettiness of her face, which waned before a more
judicious scrutiny. Her look was bold and reckless, and upon her countenance, where yet the
contours of youth survived, were the finger- marks of old age&rsquo;s credentialed courier, Late
Hours.
The young woman fixed her unshrinking gaze upon Lorison, and called to him in the
voice of the wronged heroine in straits:
&ldquo;Say! You look like a good fellow; come and put up the bail, won&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ve done
nothing to get pinched for. It&rsquo;s all a mistake. See how they&rsquo;re treating me! You won&rsquo;t be sorry,
if you&rsquo;ll help me out of this. Think of your sister or your girl being dragged along the streets
this way! I say, come along now, like a good fellow.&rdquo;
It may be that Lorison, in spite of the unconvincing bathos of this appeal, showed a
sympathetic face, for one of the officers left the woman&rsquo;s side, and went over to him.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Sir,&rdquo; he said, in a husky, confidential tone; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s the right party. We took
her after the first act at the Green Light Theatre, on a wire from the chief of police ofChicago. It&rsquo;s only a square or two to the station. Her rig&rsquo;s pretty bad, but she refused to
change clothes &ndash; or, rather,&rdquo; added the officer, with a smile, &ldquo;to put on some. I thought I&rsquo;d
explain matters to you so you wouldn&rsquo;t think she was being imposed upon.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What is the charge?&rdquo; asked Lorison.
&ldquo;Grand larceny. Diamonds. Her husband is a jeweller in Chicago. She cleaned his show
case of the sparklers, and skipped with a comic-opera troupe.&rdquo;
The policeman, perceiving that the interest of the entire group of spectators was
centred upon himself and Lorison &ndash; their conference being regarded as a possible new complication &ndash; was fain to prolong the situation &ndash; which reflected his own importance &ndash; by a
little afterpiece of philosophical comment.
&ldquo;A gentleman like you, Sir,&rdquo; he went on affably, &ldquo;would never notice it, but it comes in
my line to observe what an immense amount of trouble is made by that com- bination &ndash; I
mean the stage, diamonds and light-headed women who aren&rsquo;t satisfied with good homes. I
tell you, Sir, a man these days and nights wants to know what his women folks are up to.&rdquo;
The policeman smiled a good night, and returned to the side of his charge, who had
been intently watching Lorison&rsquo;s face during the conversation, no doubt for some indication
of his intention to render succour. Now, at the failure of the sign, and at the movement
made to continue the ignominious progress, she abandoned hope, and addressed him thus,
pointedly:
&ldquo;You damn chalk-faced quitter! You was thinking of giving me a hand, but you let the
cop talk you out of it the first word. You&rsquo;re a dandy to tie to. Say, if you ever get a girl, she&rsquo;ll
have a picnic. Won&rsquo;t she work you to the queen&rsquo;s taste! Oh, my!&rdquo; She concluded with a
taunting, shrill laugh that rasped Lorison like a saw. The policemen urged her forward; the
delighted train of gaping followers closed up the rear; and the captive Amazon, accepting
her fate, extended the scope of her maledictions so that none in hearing might seem to be
slighted.
Then there came upon Lorison an overwhelming revulsion of his perspective. It may be
that he had been ripe for it, that the abnormal condition of mind in which he had for so long
existed was already about to revert to its balance; however, it is certain that the events of
the last few minutes had furnished the channel, if not the impetus, for the change.
The initial determining influence had been so small a thing as the fact and manner of
his having been approached by the officer. That agent had, by the style of his accost,
restored the loiterer to his former place in society. In an instant he had been transformed
from a somewhat rancid prowler along the fishy side streets of gentility into an honest
gentleman, with whom even so lordly a guardian of the peace might agreeably exchange the
compliments.This, then, first broke the spell, and set thrilling in him a resurrected longing for the
fellowship of his kind, and the rewards of the virtuous. To what end, he vehemently asked
himself, was this fanciful self-accusation, this empty renunciation, this moral squeamishness
through which he had been led to abandon what was his heritage in life, and not beyond his
deserts? Technically, he was uncondemned; his sole guilty spot was in thought rather than
deed, and cognizance of it unshared by others. For what good, moral or sentimental, did he
slink, retreating like the hedgehog from his own shadow, to and fro in this musty Bohemia
that lacked even the picturesque?
But the thing that struck home and set him raging was the part played by the
Amazonian prisoner. To the counterpart of that astounding belligerent &ndash; identical at least, in
the way of experience &ndash; to one, by her own confession, thus far fallen, had he, not three
hours since, been united in marriage. How desirable and natural it had seemed to him then,
and how monstrous it seemed now! How the words of diamond thief number two yet
burned in his ears: &ldquo;If you ever get a cirl, she&rsquo;ll have a picnic. What did that that this women
instinc- tively knew him for one they could hoodwink? Still again, there reverberated the
policeman&rsquo;s sapient contribution to his agony: &ldquo;A man these days and nights wants to know
what his women folks are up to.&rdquo; Oh, yes, he had been a fool; he had looked at things from
the wrong standpoint.
But the wildest note in all the clamour was struck by pain&rsquo;s forefinger, jealousy. Now, at
least, he felt that keenest sting &ndash; a mounting love unworthily bestowed. Whatever she might
be, he loved her; he bore in his own breast his doom. A grating, comic flavour to his predicament struck him suddenly, and he laughed creakingly as he swung down the echoing
pavement. An impetuous desire to act, to battle with his fate, seized him. He stopped upon
his heel, and smote his palms together triumphantly. His wife was &ndash; where? But there was a
tangible link; an outlet more or less navigable, through which his derelict ship of matrimony
might yet be safely towed &ndash; the priest!
Like all imaginative men with pliable natures, Lorison was, when thoroughly stirred, apt
to become tempest- uous. With a high and stubborn indignation upon him, be retraced his
steps to the intersecting street by which he had come. Down this he hurried to the corner
where he had parted with &ndash; an astringent grimace tinctured the thought &ndash; his wife. Thence
still back he harked, follow- ing through an unfamiliar district his stimulated recollec- tions of
the way they had come from that preposterous wedding. Many times he went abroad, and
nosed his way back to, the trail, furious.
At last, when he reached the dark, calamitous building in which his madness had
culminated, and found the black hallway, he dashed down it, perceiving no light or sound.
But he raised his voice, hailing loudly; reckless of everything but that he should find the old
mischief- maker with the eyes that looked too far awav to see the disaster he had wrought.
The door opened, and in the stream of light Father Rogan stood, his book in hand, with his
finger marking the place.&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Lorison. &ldquo;You are the man I want. I had a wife of you a few hours ago. I
would not trouble you, but I neglected to note how it was done. Will you oblige me with the
information whether the business is beyond remedy?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Come inside,&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;there are other lodgers in the house, who might prefer
sleep to even a gratified curiosity.&rdquo;
Lorison entered the room and took the chair offered him. The priest&rsquo;s eyes looked a
courteous interrogation.
&ldquo;I must apologize again,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;for so soon intruding upon you with my
marital infelicities, but, as my wife has neglected to furnish me with her address, I am
deprived of the legitimate recourse of a family row.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am quite a plain man,&rdquo; said Father Rogan, pleas- antly; &ldquo;but I do not see how I am to
ask you questions.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pardon my indirectness,&rdquo; said Lorison; &ldquo;I will ask one. In this room to-night you
pronounced me to be a husband. You afterward spoke of additional rites or performances
that either should or could be effected. I paid little attention to your words then, but I am
hungry to hear them repeated now. As matters stand, am I married past all help?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You are as legally and as firmly bound,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;as though it had been done in
a cathedral, in the presence of thousands. The additional observances I referred to are not
necessary to the strictest legality of the act, but were advised as a precaution for the future
&ndash; for convenience of proof in such contingencies as wills, inheritances and the like.&rdquo;
Lorison laughed harshly.
&ldquo;Many thanks,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then there is no mistake, and I am the happy benedict. I
suppose I should go stand upon the bridal corner, and when my wife gets through walking
the streets she will look me up.&rdquo;
Father Rogan regarded him calmly.
&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when a man and woman come to me to be married I always marry
them. I do this for the sake of other people whom they might go away and marry if they did
not marry each other. As you see, I do not seek your confidence; but your case seems to me
to be one not altogether devoid of interest. Very few marriages that have come to my notice
have brought such well- expressed regret within so short a time. I will hazard one question:
were you not under the impression that you loved the lady you married, at the time you did
so;&ldquo;&ldquo;Loved her!&rdquo; cried Lorison, wildly. &ldquo;Never so well as now, though she told me she
deceived and sinned and stole. Never more than now, when, perhaps, she is laughing at the
fool she cajoled and left, with scarcely a word, to return to God only knows what particular
line of her former folly.&rdquo;
Father Rooan answered nothing. During the silence that succeeded, he sat with a quiet
expectation beaming in his full, lambent eye.
&ldquo;If you would listen &ndash; &rdquo; began Lorison. The priest held up his hand.
&ldquo;As I hoped,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought you would trust me. Wait but a moment.&rdquo; He brought
a long clay pipe, filled and lighted it.
&ldquo;Now, my son,&rdquo; he said.
Lorison poured a twelve month&rsquo;s accumulated con- fidence into Father Rogan&rsquo;s ear. He
told all; not sparing himself or omitting the facts of his past, the events of the night, or his
disturbing conjectures and fears.
&ldquo;The main point,&rdquo; said the priest, when he had con- cluded, &ldquo;seems to me to be this &ndash;
are you reasonably sure that you love this woman whom you have married?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed Lorisoii, rising impulsively to his feet - &ldquo;why should I deny it? But look
at me &ndash; am fish, flesh or fowl? That is the main point to me, assure you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said the priest, also risino,, and laying down his pipe. &ldquo;The situation
is one that has taxed the endurance of much older men than you &ndash; in fact, especially much
older men than you. I will try to relieve you from it, and this night. You shall see for yourself
into exactly what predicament you have fallen, and how you shall, possibly, be extricated.
There is no evidence so credible as that of the eyesight.&rdquo;
Father Rogan moved about the room, and donned a soft black hat. Buttoning his coat
to his throat, he laid his hand on the doorknob. &ldquo;Let us walk,&rdquo; he said.
The two went out upon the street. The priest turned his face down it, and Lorison
walked with him through a squalid district, where the houses loomed, awry and
desoiate-looking, high above them. Presently they turned into a less dismal side street,
where the houses were smaller, and, though hinting of the most meagre comfort, lacked the
concentrated wretchedness of the more populous byways.
At a segregated, two-story house Father Rogan halted, and mounted the steps with the
confidence of a familiar visitor. He ushered Lorison into a narrow hallway, faintly lighted by a
cobwebbed hanging lamp. Almost immediately a door to the right opened and a dingy Irishwoman protruded her head.&ldquo;Good evening to ye, Mistress Geehan,&rdquo; said the priest, unconsciously, it seemed,
falling into a delicately flavoured brogue. &ldquo;And is it yourself can tell me if Norah has gone out
again, the night, maybe?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s yer blissid reverence! Sure and I can tell ye the same. The purty darlin&rsquo; wint out,
as usual, but a bit later. And she says: &lsquo;Mother Geehan,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s me last noight out,
praise the saints, this noight is!&rsquo; And, oh, yer reverence, the swate, beautiful drame of a
dress she had this toime! White satin and silk and ribbons, and lace about the neck and
arrums &ndash; &lsquo;twas a sin, yer reverence, the gold was spint upon it.&rdquo;
The priest heard Lorison catch his breath painfully, and a faint smile flickered across his
own clean-cut mouth.
&ldquo;Well, then, Mistress Geehan,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just step upstairs and see the bit boy for a
minute, and I&rsquo;ll take this Gentleman up with me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s awake, thin,&rdquo; said the woman. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve just come down from sitting wid him the last
hour, tilling him fine shtories of ould County Tyrone. &lsquo;Tis a greedy gos- soon, it is, yer
riverence, for me shtories.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Small the doubt,&rdquo; said Father Rogan. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no rocking would put him to slape the
quicker, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;
Amid the woman&rsquo;s shrill protest against the retort, the two men ascended the steep
stairway. The priest pushed open the door of a room near its top.
&ldquo;Is that you already, sister?&rdquo; drawled a sweet, childish voice from the darkness.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only ould Father Denny come to see ye, darlin&rsquo;; and a foine gentleman I&rsquo;ve brought
to make ye a gr-r-and call. And ye resaves us fast aslape in bed! Shame on yez manners!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, Father Denny, is that you? I&rsquo;m glad. And will you light the lamp, please? It&rsquo;s on the
table by the door. And quit talking like Mother Geehan, Father Denny.&rdquo;
The priest lit the lamp, and Lorison saw a tiny, towsled- haired boy, with a thin, delicate
face, sitting up in a small bed in a corner. Quickly, also, his rapid glance con- sidered the
room and its contents. It was furnished with more than comfort, and its adornments plainly
indicated a woman&rsquo;s discerning taste. An open door beyond revealed the blackness of an
adjoining room&rsquo;s interior.
The boy clutched both of Father Rogan&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you came,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
why did you come in the night? Did sister send you?&ldquo;&ldquo;Off wid ye! Am I to be sint about, at me age, as was Terence McShane, of Ballymahone?
I come on me own r-r-responsibility.&rdquo;
Lorison had also advanced to the boy&rsquo;s bedside. He was fond of children; and the wee
fellow, laving himself down to sleep alone ill that dark room, stirred-his heart.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid, little man?&rdquo; he asked, stooping down beside him.
&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; answered the boy, with a shy smile, &ldquo;when the rats make too much noise.
But nearly every night, when sister goes out, Molt-her Geehan stays a while with me, and
tells me funny stories. I&rsquo;m not often afraid, sir.&rdquo;
&ldquo;This brave little gentleman,&rdquo; said Father Rogan, &ldquo;is a scholar of mine. Every day from
half-past six to half- past eight &ndash; when sister comes for him &ndash; he stops in my study, and we
find out what&rsquo;s in the inside of books. He knows multiplication, division and fractions; and
he&rsquo;s troubling me to begin wid the chronicles of Ciaran of Clonmaciioise, Corurac
McCullenan and Cuan O&rsquo;Loc- hain, the gr-r-reat Irish histhorians.&rdquo; The boy was evidently
accustomed to the priest&rsquo;s Celtic pleasantries. A little, appreciative grin was all the attention
the insin- nation of pedantry received.
Lorison, to have saved his life, could not have put to the child one of those vital
questions that were wildly beating about, unanswered, in his own brain. The little fellow was
very like Norah; he had the same shining hair and candid eyes.
&ldquo;Oh, Father Denny,&rdquo; cried the boy, suddenly, &ldquo;I forgot to tell you! Sister is not going
away at night any more! She told me so when she kissed me good night as she was leaving.
And she said she was so happy, and then she cried. Wasn&rsquo;t that queer? But I&rsquo;m glad; aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, lad. And now, ye omadhaun, go to sleep, and say good night; we must be going.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Which shall I do first, Father Denny?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Faith, he&rsquo;s caught me again! Wait till I get the sassenach into the annals of Tageruach,
the hagiographer; I&rsquo;ll give him enough of the Irish idiom to make him more respectful.&rdquo;
The light was out, and the small, brave voice bidding them good night from the dark
room. They groped downstairs, and tore away from the garrulity of Mother Geehan.
Again the priest steered them through the dim ways, but this time in another direction.
His conductor was serenely silent, and Lorison followed his example to the extent of seldom
speaking. Serene he could not be. His heart beat suffocatingly in his breast. The following of
this blind, menacing trail was pregnant with he knew not what humiliating revelation to be
delivered at its end.They came into a more pretentious street, where trade, it could be surmised, flourished
by day. And again the priest paused; this time before a lofty building, whose great doors and
windows in the lowest floor were carefully shuttered and barred. Its higher apertures were
dark, save in the third story, the windows of which were bril- liantly lighted. Lorison&rsquo;s ear
caught a distant, regular, pleasing thrumming, as of music above. They stood at an angle of
the building. Up, along the side nearest them, mounted an iron stairway. At its top was an
upright, illuminated parallelogram. Father Rogan had stopped, and stood, musing.
&ldquo;I will say this much,&rdquo; he remarked, thoughtfully: &ldquo;I believe you to be a better man than
you think yourself to be, and a better man than I thought some hours ago. But do not take
this,&rdquo; he added, with a smile, &ldquo;as much praise. I promised you a possible deliverance from an
unhappy perplexity. I will have to modify that promise. I can only remove the mystery that
enhanced that per- plexity. Your deliverance depends upon yourself. Come.&rdquo;
He led his companion up the stairway. Halfway up, Lorison caught him by the sleeve.
&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;I love that woman.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You desired to know.
&ldquo;I &ndash; Go on.&rdquo;
The priest reached the landing at the top of the stairway. Lorison, behind him, saw that
the illuminated space was the glass upper half of a door opening into the lighted room. The
rhythmic music increased as they neared it; the stairs shook with the mellow vibrations.
Lorison stopped breathing when he set foot upon the highest step, for the priest stood
aside, and motioned him to look through the glass of the door.
His eye, accustomed to the darkness, met first a blind- ing glare, and then he made out
the faces and forms of many people, amid an extravagant display of splendid robings &ndash;
billowy laces, brilliant-hued finery, ribbons, silks and misty drapery. And then he caught the
mean. ing of that jarring hum, and he saw the tired, pale, happy face of his wife, bending, as
were a score of others, over her sewing machine &ndash; toiling, toiling. Here was the folly she
pursued, and the end of his quest.
But not his deliverance, though even then remorse struck him. His shamed soul
fluttered once more before it retired to make room for the other and better one. For, to
temper his thrill of joy, the shine of the satin and the glimmer of ornaments recalled the
disturbing figure of the bespangled Amazon, and the base duplicate histories it by the glare
of footlights and stolen diamonds. It is past the wisdom of him who only sets the scenes,
either to praise or blame the man. But this time his love over- came his scruples. He took a
quick step, and reached out his hand for the doorknob. Father Rogan was quicker to arrest it
and draw him back.&ldquo;You use my trust in you queerly,&rdquo; said the priest sternly. &ldquo;What are you about to do?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am going to my wife,&rdquo; said Lorison. &ldquo;Let me pass.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the priest, holding him firmly by the arm. &ldquo;I am about to put you in
possession of a piece of knowledge of which, thus far, you have scarcely proved deserving. I
do not think you ever will; but I will not dwell upon that. You see in that room the woman
you married, working for a frugal living for herself, and a generous comfort for an idolized
brother. This building belongs to the chief costumer of the city. For months the advance
orders for the coming Mardi Gras festivals have kept the work going day and night. I myself
secured employment here for Norah. She toils here each night from nine o&rsquo;clock until
daylight, and, besides, carries home with her some of the finer costumes, requiring more
delicate needlework, and works there part of the day. Somehow, you two have remained
strangely ignorant of each other&rsquo;s lives. Are you convinced now that your wife is not walking
the streets?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Let me go to her,&rdquo; cried Lorison, again struggling, &ldquo;and beg her forgiveness!&rsquo;
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;do you owe me nothing? Be quiet. It seems so often that Heaven
lets fall its choicest gifts into hands that must be taught to hold them. Listen again. You
forgot that repentant sin must not comprom- ise, but look up, for redemption, to the purest
and best. You went to her with the fine-spun sophistry that peace could be found in a
mutual guilt; and she, fearful of losing what her heart so craved, thought it worth the price
to buy it with a desperate, pure, beautiful lie. I have known her since the day she was born;
she is as innocent and unsullied in life and deed as a holy saint. In that lowly street where
she dwells she first saw the light, and she has lived there ever since, spending her days in
generous self-sacrifice for others. Och, ye spalpeen!&rdquo; continued Father Rogan, raising his
finger in kindly anger at Lorison. &ldquo;What for, I wonder, could she be after making a fool of
hersilf, and shamin&rsquo; her swate soul with lies, for the like of you!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Lorison, trembling, &ldquo;say what you please of me. Doubt it as you must, I will
yet prove my gratitude to you, and my devotion to her. But let me speak to her once now, let
me kneel for just one moment at her feet, and &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Tut, tut!&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;How many acts of a love drama do you think an old
bookworm like me capable of witnessing? Besides, what kind of figures do we cut, spying
upon the mysteries of midnight millinery! Go to meet your wife to-morrow, as she ordered
you, and obey her thereafter, and maybe some time I shall get forgive- ness for the part I
have played in this night&rsquo;s work. Off wid yez down the shtairs, now! &lsquo;Tis late, and an ould
man like me should be takin&rsquo; his rest.&ldquo;The Brief Debut of Tildy （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>If you do not know Bogle&rsquo;s Chop House and Family Restaurant it is your loss. For if you
are one of the fortunate ones who dine expensively you should be interested to know how
the other half consumes provisions. And if you belong to the half to whom waiters&rsquo; checks
are things of moment, you should know Bogle&rsquo;s, for there you get your money&rsquo;s worth&ndash;in
quantity, at least.
Bogle&rsquo;s is situated in that highway of bourgeoisie, that boulevard of
Brown-Jones-and-Robinson, Eighth Avenue. There are two rows of tables in the room, six in
each row. On each table is a caster- stand, containing cruets of condiments and seasons.
From the pepper cruet you may shake a cloud of something tasteless and melancholy, like
volcanic dust. From the salt cruet you may expect nothing. Though a man should extract a
sanguinary stream from the pallid turnip, yet wili his prowess be balked when he comes to
wrest salt from Bogle&rsquo;s cruets. Also upon each table stands the counterfeit of that benign
sauce made &ldquo;from the recipe of a nobleman in India.&rdquo;
At the cashier&rsquo;s desk sits Bogle, cold, sordid, slow, smouldering, and takes your money.
Behind a mountain of toothpicks he makes your change, files your check, and ejects at you,
like a toad, a word about the weather. Beyond a corroboration of his meteorological
statement you would better not venture. You are not Bogle&rsquo;s friend; you are a fed, transient
customer, and you and he may not meet again until the blowing of Gabriel&rsquo;s dinner horn. So
take your change and go&ndash;to the devil if you like. There you have Bogle&rsquo;s sentiments.
The needs of Bogle&rsquo;s customers were supplied by two waitresses and a Voice. One of
the waitresses was named Aileen. She was tall, beautiful, lively, gracious and learned in
persiflage. Her other name? There was no more necessity for another name at Bogle&rsquo;s than
there was for finger-bowls.
The name of the other waitress was Tildy. Why do you suggest Matilda? Please listen
this time&ndash;Tildy&ndash;Tildy. Tildy was dumpy, plain-faced, and too anxious to please to please.
Repeat the last clause to yourself once or twice, and make the acquaintance of the duplicate
infinite.
The Voice at Bogle&rsquo;s was invisible. It came from the kitchen, and did not shine in the
way of originality. It was a heathen Voice, and contented itself with vain repetitions of
exclamations emitted by the waitresses concerning food.
Will it tire you to be told again that Aileen was beautiful? Had she donned a few
hundred dollars&rsquo; worth of clothes and joined the Easter parade, and had you seen her, you
would have hastened to say so yourself.The customers at Bogle&rsquo;s were her slaves. Six tables full she could wait upon at once.
They who were in a hurry restrained their impatience for the joy of merely gazing upon her
swiftly moving, graceful figure. They who had finished eating ate more that they might
continue in the light of her smiles. Every man there&ndash;and they were mostly men&ndash;tried to
make his impression upon her.
Aileen could successfully exchange repartee against a dozen at once. And every smile
that she sent forth lodged, like pellets from a scatter-gun, in as many hearts. And all this
while she would be performing astounding feats with orders of pork and beans, pot roasts,
ham-and, sausage-and-the-wheats, and any quantity of things on the iron and in the pan
and straight up and on the side. With all this feasting and flirting and merry exchange of wit
Bogle&rsquo;s came mighty near being a salon, with Aileen for its Madame Recamier.
If the transients were entranced by the fascinating Aileen, the regulars were her
adorers. There was much rivalry among many of the steady customers. Aileen could have
had an engagement every evening. At least twice a week some one took her to a theatre or
to a dance. One stout gentleman whom she and Tildy had privately christened &ldquo;The Hog&rdquo;
presented her with a turquoise ring. Another one known as &ldquo;Fresby,&rdquo; who rode on the
Traction Company&rsquo;s repair wagon, was going to give her a poodle as soon as his brother got
the hauling contract in the Ninth. And the man who always ate spareribs and spinach and
said he was a stock broker asked her to go to &ldquo;Parsifal&rdquo; with him.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where this place is,&rdquo; said Aileen while talking it over with Tildy, &ldquo;but the
wedding-ring&rsquo;s got to be on before I put a stitch into a travelling dress&ndash;ain&rsquo;t that right? Well,
I guess!&rdquo;
But, Tildy!
In steaming, chattering, cabbage-scented Bogle&rsquo;s there was almost a heart tragedy.
Tildy with the blunt nose, the hay-coloured hair, the freckled skin, the bag-o&rsquo;-meal figure,
had never had an admirer. Not a man followed her with his eyes when she went to and fro in
the restaurant save now and then when they glared with the beast-hunger for food. None of
them bantered her gaily to coquettish interchanges of wit. None of them loudly &ldquo;jollied&rdquo; her
of mornings as they did Aileen, accusing her, when the eggs were slow in coming, of late
hours in the company of envied swains. No one had ever given her a turquoise ring or
invited her upon a voyage to mysterious, distant &ldquo;Parsifal.&rdquo;
Tildy was a good waitress, and the men tolerated her. They who sat at her tables spoke
to her briefly. with quotations from the bill of fare; and then raised their voices in honeyed
and otherwise-flavoured accents, eloquently addressed to the fair Aileen. They writhed in
their chairs to gaze around and over the impending form of Tildy, that Aileen&rsquo;s pulchritude
might season and make ambrosia of their bacon and eggs.And Tildy was content to be the unwooed drudge if Aileen could receive the flattery
and the homage. The blunt nose was loyal to the short Grecian. She was Aileen&rsquo;s friend; and
she was glad to see her rule hearts and wean the attention of men from smoking pot-pie
and lemon meringue. But deep below our freckles and hay-coloured hair the unhandsomest
of us dream of a prince or a princess, not vicarious, but coming to us alone.
There was a morning when Aileen tripped in to work with a slightly bruised eye; and
Tildy&rsquo;s solicitude was almost enough to heal any optic.
&ldquo;Fresh guy,&rdquo; explained Aileen, &ldquo;last night as I was going home at Twenty-third and Sixth.
Sashayed up, so he did, and made a break. I turned him down, cold, and he made a sneak;
but followed me down to Eighteenth, and tried his hot air again. Gee! but I slapped him a
good one, side of the face. Then he give me that eye. Does it look real awful, Til? I should
hate that Mr. Nicholson should see it when he comes in for his tea and toast at ten.&rdquo;
Tildy listened to the adventure with breathless admiration. No man had ever tried to
follow her. She was safe abroad at any hour of the twenty-four. What bliss it must have been
to have had a man follow one and black one&rsquo;s eye for love!
Among the customers at Bogle&rsquo;s was a young man named Seeders, who worked in a
laundry office. Mr. Seeders was thin and had light hair, and appeared to have been recently
rough-dried and starched. He was too diffident to aspire to Aileen&rsquo;s notice; so he usually sat
at one of Tildy&rsquo;s tables, where he devoted himself to silence and boiled weakfish.
One day when Mr. Seeders came in to dinner he had been drinking beer. There were
only two or three customers in the restaurant. When Mr. Seeders had finished his weakfish
he got up, put his arm around Tildy&rsquo;s waist, kissed her loudly and impudently, walked out
upon the street, snapped his fingers in the direction of the laundry, and hied himself to play
pennies in the slot machines at the Amusement Arcade.
For a few moments Tildy stood petrified. Then she was aware of Aileen shaking at her
an arch forefinger, and saying:
&ldquo;Why, Til, you naughty girl! Ain&rsquo;t you getting to be awful, Miss Slyboots! First thing I
know you&rsquo;ll be stealing some of my fellows. I must keep an eye on you, my lady.&rdquo;
Another thing dawned upon Tildy&rsquo;s recovering wits. In a moment she had advanced
from a hopeless, lowly admirer to be an Eve-sister of the potent Aileen. She herself was now
a man-charmer, a mark for Cupid, a Sabine who must be coy when the Romans were at their
banquet boards. Man had found her waist achievable and her lips desirable. The sudden and
amatory Seeders had, as it were, performed for her a miraculous piece of one-day laundry
work. He had taken the sackcloth of her uncomeliness, had washed, dried, starched and
ironed it, and returned it to her sheer embroidered lawn&ndash;the robe of Venus herself.The freckles on Tildy&rsquo;s cheeks merged into a rosy flush. Now both Circe and Psyche
peeped from her brightened eyes. Not even Aileen herself had been publicly embraced and
kissed in the restaurant.
Tildy could not keep the delightful secret. When trade was slack she went and stood at
Bogle&rsquo;s desk. Her eyes were shining; she tried not to let her words sound proud and
boastful.
&ldquo;A gentleman insulted me to-day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He hugged me around the waist and
kissed me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That so?&rdquo; said Bogle, cracking open his business armour. &ldquo;After this week you get a
dollar a week more.&rdquo;
At the next regular meal when Tildy set food before customers with whom she had
acquaintance she said to each of them modestly, as one whose merit needed no bolstering:
&ldquo;A gentleman insulted me to-day in the restaurant. He put his arm around my waist and
kissed me.&rdquo;
The diners accepted the revelation in various ways&ndash;some incredulously, some with
congratulations; others turned upon her the stream of badinage that had hitherto been
directed at Aileen alone. And Tildy&rsquo;s heart swelled in her bosom, for she saw at last the
towers of Romance rise above the horizon of the grey plain in which she had for so long
travelled.
For two days Mr. Seeders came not again. During that time Tildy established herself
firmly as a woman to be wooed. She bought ribbons, and arranged her hair like Aileen&rsquo;s, and
tightened her waist two inches. She had a thrilling but delightful fear that Mr. Seeders would
rush in suddenly and shoot her with a pistol. He must have loved her desperately; and
impulsive lovers are always blindly jealous.
Even Aileen had not been shot at with a pistol. And then Tildy rather hoped that he
would not shoot at her, for she was always loyal to Aileen; and she did not want to
overshadow her friend.
At 4 o&rsquo;clock on the afternoon of the third day Mr. Seeders came in. There were no
customers at the tables. At the back end of the restaurant Tildy was refilling the mustard
pots and Aileen was quartering pies. Mr. Seeders walked back to where they stood.
Tildy looked up and saw him, gasped, and pressed the mustard spoon against her heart.
A red hair-bow was in her hair; she wore Venus&rsquo;s Eighth Avenue badge, the blue bead
necklace with the swinging silver symbolic heart.Mr. Seeders was flushed and embarrassed. He plunged one hand into his hip pocket
and the other into a fresh pumpkin pie.
&ldquo;Miss Tildy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I want to apologise for what I done the other evenin&rsquo;. Tell you the
truth, I was pretty well tanked up or I wouldn&rsquo;t of done it. I wouldn&rsquo;t do no lady that a-way
when I was sober. So I hope, Miss Tildy, you&rsquo;ll accept my &lsquo;pology, and believe that I wouldn&rsquo;t
of done it if I&rsquo;d known what I was doin&rsquo; and hadn&rsquo;t of been drunk.&rdquo;
With this handsome plea Mr. Seeders backed away, and departed, feeling that
reparation had been made.
But behind the convenient screen Tildy had thrown herself flat upon a table among the
butter chips and the coffee cups, and was sobbing her heart out&ndash;out and back again to the
grey plain wherein travel they with blunt noses and hay-coloured hair. From her knot she
had torn the red hair-bow and cast it upon the floor. Seeders she despised utterly; she had
but taken his kiss as that of a pioneer and prophetic prince who might have set the clocks
going and the pages to running in fairyland. But the kiss had been maudlin and unmeant;
the court had not stirred at the false alarm; she must forevermore remain the Sleeping
Beauty.
Yet not all was lost. Aileen&rsquo;s arm was around her; and Tildy&rsquo;s red hand groped among
the butter chips till it found the warm clasp of her friend&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret, Til,&rdquo; said Aileen, who did not understand entirely. &ldquo;That turnip-faced
little clothespin of a Seeders ain&rsquo;t worth it. He ain&rsquo;t anything of a gentleman or he wouldn&rsquo;t
ever of apologised.&rdquo;
Buried Treasure （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>There are many kinds of fools. Now, will everybody please sit still until they are called
upon specifically to rise?
I had been every kind of fool except one. I had expended my patrimony, pretended my
matrimony, played poker, lawn-tennis, and bucket-shops&ndash;parted soon with my money in
many ways. But there remained one rule of the wearer of cap and bells that I had not played.
That was the Seeker after Buried Treasure. To few does the delectable furor come. But of all
the would-be followers in the hoof- prints of King Midas none has found a pursuit so rich in
pleasurable promise.But, going back from my theme a while&ndash;as lame pens must do&ndash;I was a fool of the
sentimental soft. I saw May Martha Mangum, and was hers. She was eighteen, the color of
the white ivory keys of a new piano, beautiful, and possessed by the exquisite solemnity and
pathetic witchery of an unsophisticated angel doomed to live in a small, dull, Texas
prairie-town. She had a spirit and charm that could have enabled her to pluck rubies like
raspberries from the crown of Belgium or any other sporty kingdom, but she did not know it,
and I did not paint the picture for her.
You see, I wanted May Martha Mangum for to have and to hold. I wanted her to abide
with me, and put my slippers and pipe away every day in places where they cannot be found
of evenings.
May Martha&rsquo;s father was a man hidden behind whiskers and spectacles. He lived for
bugs and butterflies and all insects that fly or crawl or buzz or get down your back or in the
butter. He was an etymologist, or words to that effect. He spent his life seining the air for
flying fish of the June-bug order, and then sticking pins through &lsquo;em and calling &lsquo;em names.
He and May Martha were the whole family. He prized her highly as a fine specimen of
the racibus humanus because she saw that he had food at times, and put his clothes on right
side before, and kept his alcohol-bottles filled. Scientists, they say, are apt to be absentminded.
There was another besides myself who thought May Martha Mangum one to be
desired. That was Goodloe Banks, a young man just home from college. He had all the
attainments to be found in books&ndash;Latin, Greek, philosophy, and especially the higher
branches of mathematics and logic.
If it hadn&rsquo;t been for his habit of pouring out this information and learning on every one
that he addressed, I&rsquo;d have liked him pretty well. But, even as it was, he and I were, you
would have thought, great pals.
We got together every time we could because each of us wanted to pump the other for
whatever straws we could to find which way the wind blew from the heart of May Martha
Mangum&ndash;rather a mixed metaphor; Goodloe Banks would never have been guilty of that.
That is the way of rivals.
You might say that Goodloe ran to books, manners, culture, rowing, intellect, and
clothes. I would have put you in mind more of baseball and Friday-night debating
societies&ndash;by way of culture&ndash;and maybe of a good horseback rider.
But in our talks together, and in our visits and conversation with May Martha, neither
Goodloe Banks nor I could find out which one of us she preferred. May Martha was a
natural-born non-committal, and knew in her cradle how to keep people guessing.As I said, old man Mangum was absentminded. After a long time he found out one
day&ndash;a little butterfly must have told him-that two young men were trying to throw a net
over the head of the young person, a daughter, or some such technical appendage, who
looked after his comforts.
I never knew scientists could rise to such occasions. Old Mangum orally labelled and
classified Goodloe and myself easily among the lowest orders of the vertebrates; and in
English, too, without going any further into Latin than the simple references to Orgetorix,
Rex Helvetii&ndash;which is as far as I ever went, myself. And he told us that if he ever caught us
around his house again he would add us to his collection.
Goodloe Banks and I remained away five days, expecting the storm to subside. When
we dared to call at the house again May Martha Mangum and her father were gone. Gone!
The house they had rented was closed. Their little store of goods and chattels was gone also.
And not a word of farewell to either of us from May Martha&ndash;not a white, fluttering
note pinned to the hawthorn-bush; not a chalk-mark on the gate-post nor a post-card in the
post-office to give us a clew.
For two months Goodloe Banks and I&ndash;separately&ndash;tried every scheme we could think of
to track the runaways. We used our friendship and influence with the ticket-agent, with
livery-stable men, railroad conductors, and our one lone, lorn constable, but without results.
Then we became better friends and worse enemies than ever. We forgathered in the
back room of Snyder&rsquo;s saloon every afternoon after work, and played dominoes, and laid
conversational traps to find out from each other if anything had been discovered. That is the
way of rivals.
Now, Goodloe Banks had a sarcastic way of displaying his own learning and putting me
in the class that was reading &ldquo;Poor Jane Ray, her bird is dead, she cannot play.&rdquo; Well, I rather
liked Goodloe, and I had a contempt for his college learning, and I was always regarded as
good- natured, so I kept my temper. And I was trying to find out if he knew anything about
May Martha, so I endured his society.
In talking things over one afternoon he said to me:
&ldquo;Suppose you do find her, Ed, whereby would you profit? Miss Mangum has a mind.
Perhaps it is yet uncultured, but she is destined for higher things than you could give her. I
have talked with no one who seemed to appreciate more the enchantment of the ancient
poets and writers and the modern cults that have assimilated and expended their
philosophy of life. Don&rsquo;t you think you are wasting your time looking for her?&rdquo;
&ldquo;My idea,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;of a happy home is an eight-room house in a grove of live-oaks by
the side of a charco on a Texas prairie. A piano,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;with an automatic player in thesitting-room, three thousand head of cattle under fence for a starter, a buckboard and
ponies always hitched at a post for &lsquo;the missus &lsquo;&ndash;and May Martha Mangum to spend the
profits of the ranch as she pleases, and to abide with me, and put my slippers and pipe away
every day in places where they cannot be found of evenings. That,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is what is to be;
and a fig&ndash;a dried, Smyrna, dago-stand fig&ndash;for your curriculums, cults, and philosophy.&rdquo;
&ldquo;She is meant for higher things,&rdquo; repeated Goodloe Banks.
&ldquo;Whatever she is meant for,&rdquo; I answered, just now she is out of pocket. And I shall find
her as soon as I can without aid of the colleges.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The game is blocked,&rdquo; said Goodloe, putting down a domino and we had the beer.
Shortly after that a young farmer whom I knew came into town and brought me a
folded blue paper. He said his grandfather had just died. I concealed a tear, and he went on
to say that the old man had jealously guarded this paper for twenty years. He left it to his
family as part of his estate, the rest of which consisted of two mules and a hypotenuse of
non-arable land.
The sheet of paper was of the old, blue kind used during the rebellion of the
abolitionists against the secessionists. It was dated June 14, 1863, and it described the
hiding-place of ten burro-loads of gold and silver coin valued at three hundred thousand
dollars. Old Rundle&ndash; grandfather of his grandson, Sam&ndash;was given the information by a
Spanish priest who was in on the treasure-burying, and who died many years before&ndash;no,
afterward&ndash;in old Rundle&rsquo;s house. Old Rundle wrote it down from dictation.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t your father look this up?&rdquo; I asked young Rundle.
&ldquo;He went blind before he could do so,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you hunt for it yourself?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only known about the paper for ten years. First there was the
spring ploughin&rsquo; to do, and then choppin&rsquo; the weeds out of the corn; and then come takin&rsquo;
fodder; and mighty soon winter was on us. It seemed to run along that way year after year.&rdquo;
That sounded perfectly reasonable to me, so I took it up with young Lee Rundle at
once.
The directions on the paper were simple. The whole burro cavalcade laden with the
treasure started from an old Spanish mission in Dolores County. They travelled due south by
the compass until they reached the Alamito River. They forded this, and buried the treasure
on the top of a little mountain shaped like a pack-saddle standing in a row between two
higher ones. A heap of stones marked the place of the buried treasure. All the party exceptthe Spanish priest were killed by Indians a few days later. The secret was a monopoly. It
looked good to me.
Lee Rundle suggested that we rig out a camping outfit, hire a surveyor to run out the
line from the Spanish mission, and then spend the three hundred thousand dollars seeing
the sights in Fort Worth. But, without being highly educated, I knew a way to save time and
expense.
We went to the State land-office and had a practical, what they call a &ldquo;working,&rdquo; sketch
made of all the surveys of land from the old mission to the Alamito River. On this map I drew
a line due southward to the river. The length of lines of each survey and section of land was
accurately given on the sketch. By these we found the point on the river and had a
&ldquo;connection&rdquo; made with it and an important, well- identified corner of the Los Animos
five-league survey&ndash;a grant made by King Philip of Spain.
By doing this we did not need to have the line run out by a surveyor. It was a great
saving of expense and time.
So, Lee Rundle and I fitted out a two-horse wagon team with all the accessories, and
drove a hundred and forty-nine miles to Chico, the nearest town to the point we wished to
reach. There we picked up a deputy county surveyor. He found the corner of the Los Animos
survey for us, ran out the five thousand seven hundred and twenty varas west that our
sketch called for, laid a stone on the spot, had coffee and bacon, and caught the mail-stage
back to Chico.
I was pretty sure we would get that three hundred thousand dollars. Lee Rundle&rsquo;s was
to be only one-third, because I was paying all the expenses. With that two hundred
thousand dollars I knew I could find May Martha Mangum if she was on earth. And with it I
could flutter the butterflies in old man Mangum&rsquo;s dove-cot, too. If I could find that treasure!
But Lee and I established camp. Across the river were a dozen little mountains densely
covered by cedar-brakes, but not one shaped like a pack-saddle. That did not deter us.
Appearances are deceptive. A pack-saddle, like beauty, may exist only in the eye of the
beholder.
I and the grandson of the treasure examined those cedar-covered hills with the care of
a lady hunting for the wicked flea. We explored every side, top, circumference, mean
elevation, angle, slope, and concavity of every one for two miles up and down the river. We
spent four days doing so. Then we hitched up the roan and the dun, and hauled the remains
of the coffee and bacon the one hundred and forty- nine miles back to Concho City.
Lee Rundle chewed much tobacco on the return trip. I was busy driving, because I was
in a hurry.As shortly as could be after our empty return Goodloe Banks and I forgathered in the
back room of Snyder&rsquo;s saloon to play dominoes and fish for information. I told Goodloe
about my expedition after the buried treasure.
&ldquo;If I could have found that three hundred thousand dollars,&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;I could have
scoured and sifted the surface of the earth to find May Martha Mangum.&rdquo;
&ldquo;She is meant for higher things,&rdquo; said Goodloe. &ldquo;I shall find her myself. But, tell me how
you went about discovering the spot where this unearthed increment was imprudently
buried.&rdquo;
I told him in the smallest detail. I showed him the draughtsman&rsquo;s sketch with the
distances marked plainly upon it.
After glancing over it in a masterly way, he leaned back in his chair and bestowed upon
me an explosion of sardonic, superior, collegiate laughter.
&ldquo;Well, you are a fool, Jim,&rdquo; he said, when he could speak.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your play,&rdquo; said I, patiently, fingering my double-six.
&ldquo;Twenty,&rdquo; said Goodloe, making two crosses on the table with his chalk.
&ldquo;Why am I a fool?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Buried treasure has been found before in many places.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in calculating the point on the river where your line would strike
you neglected to allow for the variation. The variation there would be nine degrees west. Let
me have your pencil.&rdquo;
Goodloe Banks figured rapidly on the back of an envelope.
&ldquo;The distance, from north to south, of the line run from the Spanish mission,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;is exactly twenty-two miles. It was run by a pocket-compass, according to your story.
Allowing for the variation, the point on the Alamito River where you should have searched
for your treasure is exactly six miles and nine hundred and forty-five varas farther west than
the place you hit upon. Oh, what a fool you are, Jim!&rdquo;
&ldquo;What is this variation that you speak of?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I thought figures never lied.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The variation of the magnetic compass,&rdquo; said Goodloe, &ldquo;from the true meridian.&rdquo;
He smiled in his superior way; and then I saw come out in his face the singular, eager,
consuming cupidity of the seeker after buried treasure.&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; he said with the air of the oracle, &ldquo;these old traditions of hidden money
are not without foundation. Suppose you let me look over that paper describing the location.
Perhaps together we might&ndash;&rdquo;
The result was that Goodloe Banks and I, rivals in love, became companions in
adventure. We went to Chico by stage from Huntersburg, the nearest railroad town. In Chico
we hired a team drawing a covered spring-wagon and camping paraphernalia. We had the
same surveyor run out our distance, as revised by Goodloe and his variations, and then
dismissed him and sent him on his homeward road.
It was night when we arrived. I fed the horses and made a fire near the bank of the river
and cooked supper. Goodloe would have helped, but his education had not fitted him for
practical things.
But while I worked he cheered me with the expression of great thoughts handed down
from the dead ones of old. He quoted some translations from the Greek at much length.
&ldquo;Anacreon,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;That was a favorite passage with Miss Mangum&ndash;as I recited
it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;She is meant for higher things,&rdquo; said I, repeating his phrase.
&ldquo;Can there be anything higher,&rdquo; asked Goodloe, &ldquo;than to dwell in the society of the
classics, to live in the atmosphere of learning and culture? You have often decried education.
What of your wasted efforts through your ignorance of simple mathematics? How soon
would you have found your treasure if my knowledge had not shown you your error?&rdquo;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a look at those hills across the river first,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and see what we find. I am
still doubtful about variations. I have been brought up to believe that the needle is true to
the pole.&rdquo;
The next morning was a bright June one. We were up early and had breakfast. Goodloe
was charmed. He recited&ndash;Keats, I think it was, and Kelly or Shelley&ndash;while I broiled the bacon.
We were getting ready to cross the river, which was little more than a shallow creek there,
and explore the many sharp-peaked cedar-covered hills on the other side.
&ldquo;My good Ulysses,&rdquo; said Goodloe, slapping me on the shoulder while I was washing the
tin breakfast-plates, &ldquo;let me see the enchanted document once more. I believe it gives
directions for climbing the hill shaped like a pack-saddle. I never saw a pack-saddle. What is
it like, Jim?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Score one against culture,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll know it when I see it.&ldquo;Goodloe was looking at old Rundle&rsquo;s document when he ripped out a most uncollegiate
swear-word.
&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; he said, holding the paper up against the sunlight. &ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; he said,
laying his finger against it.
On the blue paper&ndash;a thing I had never noticed before&ndash;I saw stand out in white letters
the word and figures : &ldquo;Malvern, 1898.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the water-mark,&rdquo; said Goodloe. &ldquo;The paper was manufactured in 1898. The writing
on the paper is dated 1863. This is a palpable fraud.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The Rundles are pretty reliable, plain, uneducated country
people. Maybe the paper manufacturers tried to perpetrate a swindle.&rdquo;
And then Goodloe Banks went as wild as his education permitted. He dropped the
glasses off his nose and glared at me.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often told you you were a fool,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have let yourself be imposed upon
by a clodhopper. And you have imposed upon me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;have I imposed upon you ?&rdquo;
&ldquo;By your ignorance,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Twice I have discovered serious flaws in your plans that a
common-school education should have enabled you to avoid. And,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I have
been put to expense that I could ill afford in pursuing this swindling quest. I am done with
it.&rdquo;
I rose and pointed a large pewter spoon at him, fresh from the dish- water.
&ldquo;Goodloe Banks,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I care not one parboiled navy bean for your education. I
always barely tolerated it in any one, and I despised it in you. What has your learning done
for you? It is a curse to yourself and a bore to your friends. Away,&rdquo; I said&ndash;&ldquo;away with your
water-marks and variations! They are nothing to me. They shall not deflect me from the
quest.&rdquo;
I pointed with my spoon across the river to a small mountain shaped like a pack-saddle.
&ldquo;I am going to search that mountain,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;for the treasure. Decide now whether
you are in it or not. If you wish to let a water- mark or a variation shake your soul, you are no
true adventurer. Decide.&ldquo;A white cloud of dust began to rise far down the river road. It was the mail-wagon from
Hesperus to Chico. Goodloe flagged it.
&ldquo;I am done with the swindle,&rdquo; said he, sourly. &ldquo;No one but a fool would pay any
attention to that paper now. Well, you always were a fool, Jim. I leave you to your fate.&rdquo;
He gathered his personal traps, climbed into the mail-wagon, adjusted his glasses
nervously, and flew away in a cloud of dust.
After I had washed the dishes and staked the horses on new grass, I crossed the shallow
river and made my way slowly through the cedar- brakes up to the top of the hill shaped like
a pack-saddle.
It was a wonderful June day. Never in my life had I seen so many birds, so many
butter-flies, dragon-flies, grasshoppers, and such winged and stinged beasts of the air and
fields.
I investigated the hill shaped like a pack-saddle from base to summit. I found an
absolute absence of signs relating to buried treasure. There was no pile of stones, no ancient
blazes on the trees, none of the evidences of the three hundred thousand dollars, as set
forth in the document of old man Rundle.
I came down the hill in the cool of the afternoon. Suddenly, out of the cedar-brake I
stepped into a beautiful green valley where a tributary small stream ran into the Alamito
River.
And there I was started to see what I took to be a wild man, with unkempt beard and
ragged hair, pursuing a giant butterfly with brilliant wings.
&ldquo;Perhaps he is an escaped madman,&rdquo; I thought; and wondered how he had strayed so
far from seats of education and learning.
And then I took a few more steps and saw a vine-covered cottage near the small stream.
And in a little grassy glade I saw May Martha Mangum plucking wild flowers.
She straightened up and looked at me. For the first time since I knew her I saw her
face&ndash;which was the color of the white keys of a new piano&ndash;turn pink. I walked toward her
without a word. She let the gathered flowers trickle slowly from her hand to the grass.
&ldquo;I knew you would come, Jim,&rdquo; she said clearly. &ldquo;Father wouldn&rsquo;t let me write, but I
knew you would come.
What followed you may guess&ndash;there was my wagon and team just across the river.I&rsquo;ve often wondered what good too much education is to a man if he can&rsquo;t use it for
himself. If all the benefits of it are to go to others, where does it come in?
For May Martha Mangum abides with me. There is an eight-room house in a live-oak
grove, and a piano with an automatic player, and a good start toward the three thousand
head of cattle is under fence.
And when I ride home at night my pipe and slippers are put away in places where they
cannot be found.
But who cares for that? Who cares&ndash;who cares?
By Courier （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>It was neither the season nor the hour when the Park had frequenters; and it is likely
that the young lady, who was seated on one of the benches at the side of the walk, had
merely obeyed a sudden impulse to sit for a while and enjoy a foretaste of coming Spring.
She rested there, pensive and still. A certain melancholy that touched her countenance
must have been of recent birth, for it had not yet altered the fine and youthful contours of
her cheek, nor subdued the arch though resolute curve of her lips.
A tall young man came striding through the park along the path near which she sat.
Behind him tagged a boy carrying a suit-case. At sight of the young lady, the man&rsquo;s face
changed to red and back to pale again. He watched her countenance as he drew nearer, with
hope and anxiety mingled on his own. He passed within a few yards of her, but he saw no
evidence that she was aware of his presence or existence.
Some fifty yards further on he suddenly stopped and sat on a bench at one side. The
boy dropped the suit-case and stared at him with wondering, shrewd eyes. The young man
took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow. It was a good handkerchief, a good brow, and
the young man was good to look at. He said to the boy:
&ldquo;I want you to take a message to that young lady on that bench. Tell her I am on my
way to the station, to leave for San Francisco, where I shall join that Alaska moose-hunting
expedition. Tell her that, since she has commanded me neither to speak nor to write to her, I
take this means of making one last appeal to her sense of justice, for the sake of what has
been. Tell her that to condemn and discard one who has not deserved such treatment,
without giving him her reasons or a chance to explain is contrary to her nature as I believe itto be. Tell her that I have thus, to a certain degree, disobeyed her injunctions, in the hope
that she may yet be inclined to see justice done. Go, and tell her that.&rdquo;
The young man dropped a half-dollar into the boy&rsquo;s hand. The boy looked at him for a
moment with bright, canny eyes out of a dirty, intelligent face, and then set off at a run. He
approached the lady on the bench a little doubtfully, but unembarrassed. He touched the
brim of the old plaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head. The lady looked at him
coolly, without prejudice or favour.
&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;dat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song and dance by me. If yer
don&rsquo;t know de guy, and he&rsquo;s tryin&rsquo; to do de Johnny act, say de word, and I&rsquo;ll call a cop in t&rsquo;ree
minutes. If yer does know him, and he&rsquo;s on de square, w&rsquo;y I&rsquo;ll spiel yer de bunch of hot air he
sent yer.&rdquo;
The young lady betrayed a faint interest.
&ldquo;A song and dance!&rdquo; she said, in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed to clothe her
words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony. &ldquo;A new idea&ndash;in the troubadour line, I
suppose. I&ndash;used to know the gentleman who sent you, so I think it will hardly be necessary
to call the police. You may execute your song and dance, but do not sing too loudly. It is a
little early yet for open-air vaudeville, and we might attract attention.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Awe,&rdquo; said the boy, with a shrug down the length of him, &ldquo;yer know what I mean, lady.
&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t a turn, it&rsquo;s wind. He told me to tell yer he&rsquo;s got his collars and cuffs in dat grip for a
scoot clean out to &lsquo;Frisco. Den he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to shoot snow-birds in de Klondike. He says yer told
him not to send &lsquo;round no more pink notes nor come hangin&rsquo; over de garden gate, and he
takes dis means of puttin&rsquo; yer wise. He says yer refereed him out like a has-been, and never
give him no chance to kick at de decision. He says yer swiped him, and never said why.&rdquo;
The slightly awakened interest in the young lady&rsquo;s eyes did not abate. Perhaps it was
caused by either the originality or the audacity of the snow-bird hunter, in thus
circumventing her express commands against the ordinary modes of communication. She
fixed her eye on a statue standing disconsolate in the dishevelled park, and spoke into the
transmitter:
&ldquo;Tell the gentleman that I need not repeat to him a description of my ideals. He knows
what they have been and what they still are. So far as they touch on this case, absolute
loyalty and truth are the ones paramount. Tell him that I have studied my own heart as well
as one can, and I know its weakness as well as I do its needs. That is why I decline to hear his
pleas, whatever they may be. I did not condemn him through hearsay or doubtful evidence,
and that is why I made no charge. But, since he persists in hearing what he already well
knows, you may convey the matter.&ldquo;Tell him that I entered the conservatory that evening from the rear, to cut a rose for
my mother. Tell him I saw him and Miss Ashburton beneath the pink oleander. The tableau
was pretty, but the pose and juxtaposition were too eloquent and evident to require
explanation. I left the conservatory, and, at the same time, the rose and my ideal. You may
carry that song and dance to your impresario.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m shy on one word, lady. Jux&ndash;jux&ndash;put me wise on dat, will yer?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Juxtaposition&ndash;or you may call it propinquity&ndash;or, if you like, being rather too near for
one maintaining the position of an ideal.&rdquo;
The gravel spun from beneath the boy&rsquo;s feet. He stood by the other bench. The man&rsquo;s
eyes interrogated him, hungrily. The boy&rsquo;s were shining with the impersonal zeal of the
translator.
&ldquo;De lady says dat she&rsquo;s on to de fact dat gals is dead easy when a feller comes spielin&rsquo;
ghost stories and tryin&rsquo; to make up, and dat&rsquo;s why she won&rsquo;t listen to no soft-soap. She says
she caught yer dead to rights, huggin&rsquo; a bunch o&rsquo; calico in de hot-house. She side- stepped in
to pull some posies and yer was squeezin&rsquo; de oder gal to beat de band. She says it looked
cute, all right all right, but it made her sick. She says yer better git busy, and make a sneak
for de train.&rdquo;
The young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden thought. His
hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat, and drew out a handful of letters. Selecting one,
he handed it to the boy, following it with a silver dollar from his vest-pocket.
&ldquo;Give that letter to the lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and ask her to read it. Tell her that it should
explain the situation. Tell her that, if she had mingled a little trust with her conception of the
ideal, much heartache might have been avoided. Tell her that the loyalty she prizes so much
has never wavered. Tell her I am waiting for an answer.&rdquo;
The messenger stood before the lady.
&ldquo;De gent says he&rsquo;s had de ski-bunk put on him widout no cause. He says he&rsquo;s no bum
guy; and, lady, yer read dat letter, and I&rsquo;ll bet yer he&rsquo;s a white sport, all right.&rdquo;
The young lady unfolded the letter; somewhat doubtfully, and read it.
DEAR DR. ARNOLD: I want to thank you for your most kind and opportune aid to my
daughter last Friday evening, when she was overcome by an attack of her old heart-trouble
in the conservatory at Mrs. Waldron&rsquo;s reception. Had you not been near to catch her as she
fell and to render proper attention, we might have lost her. I would be glad if you would call
and undertake the treatment of her case.Gratefully yours,
Robert Ashburton.
The young lady refolded the letter, and handed it to the boy.
&ldquo;De gent wants an answer,&rdquo; said the messenger. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s de word?&rdquo;
The lady&rsquo;s eyes suddenly flashed on him, bright, smiling and wet.
&ldquo;Tell that guy on the other bench,&rdquo; she said, with a happy, tremulous laugh, &ldquo;that his
girl wants him.&rdquo;
The Caballero&rsquo;s Way （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The Cisco Kid had killed six men in more or less fair scrimmages, had murdered twice as
many (mostly Mexicans), and had winged a larger number whom he modestly forbore to
count. Therefore a woman loved him.
The Kid was twenty-five, looked twenty; and a careful insurance company would have
estimated the probable time of his demise at, say, twenty-six. His habitat was anywhere
between the Frio and the Rio Grande. He killed for the love of it&ndash;because he was
quick-tempered&ndash; to avoid arrest&ndash;for his own amusement&ndash;any reason that came to his mind
would suffice. He had escaped capture because he could shoot five-sixths of a second
sooner than any sheriff or ranger in the service, and because he rode a speckled roan horse
that knew every cow-path in the mesquite and pear thickets from San Antonio to
Matamoras.
Tonia Perez, the girl who loved the Cisco Kid, was half Carmen, half Madonna, and the
rest&ndash;oh, yes, a woman who is half Carmen and half Madonna can always be something
more&ndash;the rest, let us say, was humming-bird. She lived in a grass-roofed jacal near a little
Mexican settlement at the Lone Wolf Crossing of the Frio. With her lived a father or
grandfather, a lineal Aztec, somewhat less than a thousand years old, who herded a hundred
goats and lived in a continuous drunken dream from drinking mescal. Back of the jacal a
tremendous forest of bristling pear, twenty feet high at its worst, crowded almost to its door.
It was along the bewildering maze of this spinous thicket that the speckled roan would bring
the Kid to see his girl. And once, clinging like a lizard to the ridge-pole, high up under the
peaked grass roof, he had heard Tonia, with her Madonna face and Carmen beauty and
humming-bird soul, parley with the sheriff&rsquo;s posse, denying knowledge of her man in her
soft melange of Spanish and English.One day the adjutant-general of the State, who is, ex offico, commander of the ranger
forces, wrote some sarcastic lines to Captain Duval of Company X, stationed at Laredo,
relative to the serene and undisturbed existence led by murderers and desperadoes in the
said captain&rsquo;s territory.
The captain turned the colour of brick dust under his tan, and forwarded the letter,
after adding a few comments, per ranger Private Bill Adamson, to ranger Lieutenant
Sandridge, camped at a water hole on the Nueces with a squad of five men in preservation
of law and order.
Lieutenant Sandridge turned a beautiful couleur de rose through his ordinary
strawberry complexion, tucked the letter in his hip pocket, and chewed off the ends of his
gamboge moustache.
The next morning he saddled his horse and rode alone to the Mexican settlement at
the Lone Wolf Crossing of the Frio, twenty miles away.
Six feet two, blond as a Viking, quiet as a deacon, dangerous as a machine gun,
Sandridge moved among the Jacales, patiently seeking news of the Cisco Kid.
Far more than the law, the Mexicans dreaded the cold and certain vengeance of the
lone rider that the ranger sought. It had been one of the Kid&rsquo;s pastimes to shoot Mexicans
&ldquo;to see them kick&rdquo;: if he demanded from them moribund Terpsichorean feats, simply that he
might be entertained, what terrible and extreme penalties would be certain to follow should
they anger him! One and all they lounged with upturned palms and shrugging shoulders,
filling the air with &ldquo;quien sabes&rdquo; and denials of the Kid&rsquo;s acquaintance.
But there was a man named Fink who kept a store at the Crossing&ndash;a man of many
nationalities, tongues, interests, and ways of thinking.
&ldquo;No use to ask them Mexicans,&rdquo; he said to Sandridge. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re afraid to tell. This
hombre they call the Kid&ndash;Goodall is his name, ain&rsquo;t it?&ndash;he&rsquo;s been in my store once or twice.
I have an idea you might run across him at&ndash;but I guess I don&rsquo;t keer to say, myself. I&rsquo;m two
seconds later in pulling a gun than I used to be, and the difference is worth thinking about.
But this Kid&rsquo;s got a half-Mexican girl at the Crossing that he comes to see. She lives in that
jacal a hundred yards down the arroyo at the edge of the pear. Maybe she&ndash;no, I don&rsquo;t
suppose she would, but that jacal would be a good place to watch, anyway.&rdquo;
Sandridge rode down to the jacal of Perez. The sun was low, and the broad shade of the
great pear thicket already covered the grass- thatched hut. The goats were enclosed for the
night in a brush corral near by. A few kids walked the top of it, nibbling the chaparral leaves.
The old Mexican lay upon a blanket on the grass, already in a stupor from his mescal, and
dreaming, perhaps, of the nights when he and Pizarro touched glasses to their New World
fortunes&ndash;so old his wrinkled face seemed to proclaim him to be. And in the door of the jacalstood Tonia. And Lieutenant Sandridge sat in his saddle staring at her like a gannet agape at
a sailorman.
The Cisco Kid was a vain person, as all eminent and successful assassins are, and his
bosom would have been ruffled had he known that at a simple exchange of glances two
persons, in whose minds he had been looming large, suddenly abandoned (at least for the
time) all thought of him.
Never before had Tonia seen such a man as this. He seemed to be made of sunshine
and blood-red tissue and clear weather. He seemed to illuminate the shadow of the pear
when he smiled, as though the sun were rising again. The men she had known had been
small and dark. Even the Kid, in spite of his achievements, was a stripling no larger than
herself, with black, straight hair and a cold, marble face that chilled the noonday.
As for Tonia, though she sends description to the poorhouse, let her make a millionaire
of your fancy. Her blue-black hair, smoothly divided in the middle and bound close to her
head, and her large eyes full of the Latin melancholy, gave her the Madonna touch. Her
motions and air spoke of the concealed fire and the desire to charm that she had inherited
from the gitanas of the Basque province. As for the humming-bird part of her, that dwelt in
her heart; you could not perceive it unless her bright red skirt and dark blue blouse gave you
a symbolic hint of the vagarious bird.
The newly lighted sun-god asked for a drink of water. Tonia brought it from the red jar
hanging under the brush shelter. Sandridge considered it necessary to dismount so as to
lessen the trouble of her ministrations.
I play no spy; nor do I assume to master the thoughts of any human heart; but I assert,
by the chronicler&rsquo;s right, that before a quarter of an hour had sped, Sandridge was teaching
her how to plaint a six-strand rawhide stake-rope, and Tonia had explained to him that were
it not for her little English book that the peripatetic padre had given her and the little
crippled chivo, that she fed from a bottle, she would be very, very lonely indeed.
Which leads to a suspicion that the Kid&rsquo;s fences needed repairing, and that the
adjutant-general&rsquo;s sarcasm had fallen upon unproductive soil.
In his camp by the water hole Lieutenant Sandridge announced and reiterated his
intention of either causing the Cisco Kid to nibble the black loam of the Frio country prairies
or of haling him before a judge and jury. That sounded business-like. Twice a week he rode
over to the Lone Wolf Crossing of the Frio, and directed Tonia&rsquo;s slim, slightly lemon-tinted
fingers among the intricacies of the slowly growing lariata. A six-strand plait is hard to learn
and easy to teach.The ranger knew that he might find the Kid there at any visit. He kept his armament
ready, and had a frequent eye for the pear thicket at the rear of the jacal. Thus he might
bring down the kite and the humming-bird with one stone.
While the sunny-haired ornithologist was pursuing his studies the Cisco Kid was also
attending to his professional duties. He moodily shot up a saloon in a small cow village on
Quintana Creek, killed the town marshal (plugging him neatly in the centre of his tin badge),
and then rode away, morose and unsatisfied. No true artist is uplifted by shooting an aged
man carrying an old-style .38 bulldog.
On his way the Kid suddenly experienced the yearning that all men feel when
wrong-doing loses its keen edge of delight. He yearned for the woman he loved to reassure
him that she was his in spite of it. He wanted her to call his bloodthirstiness bravery and his
cruelty devotion. He wanted Tonia to bring him water from the red jar under the brush
shelter, and tell him how the chivo was thriving on the bottle.
The Kid turned the speckled roan&rsquo;s head up the ten-mile pear flat that stretches along
the Arroyo Hondo until it ends at the Lone Wolf Crossing of the Frio. The roan whickered; for
he had a sense of locality and direction equal to that of a belt-line street-car horse; and he
knew he would soon be nibbling the rich mesquite grass at the end of a forty-foot stake-rope
while Ulysses rested his head in Circe&rsquo;s straw-roofed hut.
More weird and lonesome than the journey of an Amazonian explorer is the ride of one
through a Texas pear flat. With dismal monotony and startling variety the uncanny and
multiform shapes of the cacti lift their twisted trunks, and fat, bristly hands to encumber the
way. The demon plant, appearing to live without soil or rain, seems to taunt the parched
traveller with its lush grey greenness. It warps itself a thousand times about what look to be
open and inviting paths, only to lure the rider into blind and impassable spine-defended
&ldquo;bottoms of the bag,&rdquo; leaving him to retreat, if he can, with the points of the compass
whirling in his head.
To be lost in the pear is to die almost the death of the thief on the cross, pierced by
nails and with grotesque shapes of all the fiends hovering about.
But it was not so with the Kid and his mount. Winding, twisting, circling, tracing the
most fantastic and bewildering trail ever picked out, the good roan lessened the distance to
the Lone Wolf Crossing with every coil and turn that he made.
While they fared the Kid sang. He knew but one tune and sang it, as he knew but one
code and lived it, and but one girl and loved her. He was a single-minded man of
conventional ideas. He had a voice like a coyote with bronchitis, but whenever he chose to
sing his song he sang it. It was a conventional song of the camps and trail, running at its
beginning as near as may be to these words:Don&rsquo;t you monkey with my Lulu girl
Or I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do&ndash;
and so on. The roan was inured to it, and did not mind.
But even the poorest singer will, after a certain time, gain his own consent to refrain
from contributing to the world&rsquo;s noises. So the Kid, by the time he was within a mile or two
of Tonia&rsquo;s jacal, had reluctantly allowed his song to die away&ndash;not because his vocal
performance had become less charming to his own ears, but because his laryngeal muscles
were aweary.
As though he were in a circus ring the speckled roan wheeled and danced through the
labyrinth of pear until at length his rider knew by certain landmarks that the Lone Wolf
Crossing was close at hand. Then, where the pear was thinner, he caught sight of the grass
roof of the jacal and the hackberry tree on the edge of the arroyo. A few yards farther the
Kid stopped the roan and gazed intently through the prickly openings. Then he dismounted,
dropped the roan&rsquo;s reins, and proceeded on foot, stooping and silent, like an Indian. The
roan, knowing his part, stood still, making no sound.
The Kid crept noiselessly to the very edge of the pear thicket and reconnoitred between
the leaves of a clump of cactus.
Ten yards from his hiding-place, in the shade of the jacal, sat his Tonia calmly plaiting a
rawhide lariat. So far she might surely escape condemnation; women have been known,
from time to time, to engage in more mischievous occupations. But if all must be told, there
is to be added that her head reposed against the broad and comfortable chest of a tall
red-and-yellow man, and that his arm was about her, guiding her nimble fingers that
required so many lessons at the intricate six- strand plait.
Sandridge glanced quickly at the dark mass of pear when he heard a slight squeaking
sound that was not altogether unfamiliar. A gun- scabbard will make that sound when one
grasps the handle of a six- shooter suddenly. But the sound was not repeated; and Tonia&rsquo;s
fingers needed close attention.
And then, in the shadow of death, they began to talk of their love; and in the still July
afternoon every word they uttered reached the ears of the Kid.
&ldquo;Remember, then,&rdquo; said Tonia, &ldquo;you must not come again until I send for you. Soon he
will be here. A vaquero at the tienda said to-day he saw him on the Guadalupe three days
ago. When he is that near he always comes. If he comes and finds you here he will kill you.
So, for my sake, you must come no more until I send you the word.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;And then what?&rdquo;&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;you must bring your men here and kill him. If not, he will kill
you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t a man to surrender, that&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo; said Sandridge. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kill or be killed for the
officer that goes up against Mr. Cisco Kid.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He must die,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Otherwise there will not be any peace in the world for
thee and me. He has killed many. Let him so die. Bring your men, and give him no chance to
escape.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You used to think right much of him,&rdquo; said Sandridge.
Tonia dropped the lariat, twisted herself around, and curved a lemon- tinted arm over
the ranger&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; she murmured in liquid Spanish, &ldquo;I had not beheld thee, thou great, red
mountain of a man! And thou art kind and good, as well as strong. Could one choose him,
knowing thee? Let him die; for then I will not be filled with fear by day and night lest he hurt
thee or me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How can I know when he comes?&rdquo; asked Sandridge.
&ldquo;When he comes,&rdquo; said Tonia, &ldquo;he remains two days, sometimes three. Gregorio, the
small son of old Luisa, the lavendera, has a swift pony. I will write a letter to thee and send it
by him, saying how it will be best to come upon him. By Gregorio will the letter come. And
bring many men with thee, and have much care, oh, dear red one, for the rattlesnake is not
quicker to strike than is &lsquo;El Chivato,&rsquo; as they call him, to send a ball from his pistola.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Kid&rsquo;s handy with his gun, sure enough,&rdquo; admitted Sandridge, &ldquo;but when I come for
him I shall come alone. I&rsquo;ll get him by myself or not at all. The Cap wrote one or two things
to me that make me want to do the trick without any help. You let me know when Mr. Kid
arrives, and I&rsquo;ll do the rest.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I will send you the message by the boy Gregorio,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I knew you were
braver than that small slayer of men who never smiles. How could I ever have thought I
cared for him?&rdquo;
It was time for the ranger to ride back to his camp on the water hole. Before he
mounted his horse he raised the slight form of Tonia with one arm high from the earth for a
parting salute. The drowsy stillness of the torpid summer air still lay thick upon the dreaming
afternoon. The smoke from the fire in the jacal, where the frijoles blubbered in the iron pot,
rose straight as a plumb-line above the clay-daubed chimney. No sound or movement
disturbed the serenity of the dense pear thicket ten yards away.When the form of Sandridge had disappeared, loping his big dun down the steep banks
of the Frio crossing, the Kid crept back to his own horse, mounted him, and rode back along
the tortuous trail he had come.
But not far. He stopped and waited in the silent depths of the pear until half an hour
had passed. And then Tonia heard the high, untrue notes of his unmusical singing coming
nearer and nearer; and she ran to the edge of the pear to meet him.
The Kid seldom smiled; but he smiled and waved his hat when he saw her. He
dismounted, and his girl sprang into his arms. The Kid looked at her fondly. His thick, black
hair clung to his head like a wrinkled mat. The meeting brought a slight ripple of some
undercurrent of feeling to his smooth, dark face that was usually as motionless as a clay
mask.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s my girl?&rdquo; he asked, holding her close.
&ldquo;Sick of waiting so long for you, dear one,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;My eyes are dim with always
gazing into that devil&rsquo;s pincushion through which you come. And I can see into it such a little
way, too. But you are here, beloved one, and I will not scold. Que mal muchacho! not to
come to see your alma more often. Go in and rest, and let me water your horse and stake
him with the long rope. There is cool water in the jar for you.&rdquo;
The Kid kissed her affectionately.
&ldquo;Not if the court knows itself do I let a lady stake my horse for me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But if
you&rsquo;ll run in, chica, and throw a pot of coffee together while I attend to the caballo, I&rsquo;ll be a
good deal obliged.&rdquo;
Besides his marksmanship the Kid had another attribute for which he admired himself
greatly. He was muy caballero, as the Mexicans express it, where the ladies were concerned.
For them he had always gentle words and consideration. He could not have spoken a harsh
word to a woman. He might ruthlessly slay their husbands and brothers, but he could not
have laid the weight of a finger in anger upon a woman. Wherefore many of that interesting
division of humanity who had come under the spell of his politeness declared their disbelief
in the stories circulated about Mr. Kid. One shouldn&rsquo;t believe everything one heard, they said.
When confronted by their indignant men folk with proof of the caballero&rsquo;s deeds of infamy,
they said maybe he had been driven to it, and that he knew how to treat a lady, anyhow.
Considering this extremely courteous idiosyncrasy of the Kid and the pride he took in it,
one can perceive that the solution of the problem that was presented to him by what he saw
and heard from his hiding- place in the pear that afternoon (at least as to one of the actors)
must have been obscured by difficulties. And yet one could not think of the Kid overlooking
little matters of that kind.At the end of the short twilight they gathered around a supper of frijoles, goat steaks,
canned peaches, and coffee, by the light of a lantern in the jacal. Afterward, the ancestor, his
flock corralled, smoked a cigarette and became a mummy in a grey blanket. Tonia washed
the few dishes while the Kid dried them with the flour-sacking towel. Her eyes shone; she
chatted volubly of the inconsequent happenings of her small world since the Kid&rsquo;s last visit;
it was as all his other home-comings had been.
Then outside Tonia swung in a grass hammock with her guitar and sang sad canciones
de amor.
&ldquo;Do you love me just the same, old girl?&rdquo; asked the Kid, hunting for his cigarette papers.
&ldquo;Always the same, little one,&rdquo; said Tonia, her dark eyes lingering upon him.
&ldquo;I must go over to Fink&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the Kid, rising, &ldquo;for some tobacco. I thought I had
another sack in my coat. I&rsquo;ll be back in a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hasten,&rdquo; said Tonia, &ldquo;and tell me&ndash;how long shall I call you my own this time? Will you
be gone again to-morrow, leaving me to grieve, or will you be longer with your Tonia?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, I might stay two or three days this trip,&rdquo; said the Kid, yawning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been on the
dodge for a month, and I&rsquo;d like to rest up.&rdquo;
He was gone half an hour for his tobacco. When he returned Tonia was still lying in the
hammock.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; said the Kid, &ldquo;how I feel. I feel like there was somebody lying behind every
bush and tree waiting to shoot me. I never had mullygrubs like them before. Maybe it&rsquo;s one
of them presumptions. I&rsquo;ve got half a notion to light out in the morning before day. The
Guadalupe country is burning up about that old Dutchman I plugged down there.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You are not afraid&ndash;no one could make my brave little one fear.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t been usually regarded as a jack-rabbit when it comes to scrapping; but I
don&rsquo;t want a posse smoking me out when I&rsquo;m in your jacal. Somebody might get hurt that
oughtn&rsquo;t to.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Remain with your Tonia; no one will find you here.&rdquo;
The Kid looked keenly into the shadows up and down the arroyo and toward the dim
lights of the Mexican village.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see how it looks later on,&rdquo; was his decision.*****
At midnight a horseman rode into the rangers&rsquo; camp, blazing his way by noisy &ldquo;halloes&rdquo;
to indicate a pacific mission. Sandridge and one or two others turned out to investigate the
row. The rider announced himself to be Domingo Sales, from the Lone Wolf Crossing. he
bore a letter for Senor Sandridge. Old Luisa, the lavendera, had persuaded him to bring it, he
said, her son Gregorio being too ill of a fever to ride.
Sandridge lighted the camp lantern and read the letter. These were its words:
Dear One: He has come. Hardly had you ridden away when he came out of the pear.
When he first talked he said he would stay three days or more. Then as it grew later he was
like a wolf or a fox, and walked about without rest, looking and listening. Soon he said he
must leave before daylight when it is dark and stillest. And then he seemed to suspect that I
be not true to him. He looked at me so strange that I am frightened. I swear to him that I
love him, his own Tonia. Last of all he said I must prove to him I am true. He thinks that even
now men are waiting to kill him as he rides from my house. To escape he says he will dress in
my clothes, my red skirt and the blue waist I wear and the brown mantilla over the head,
and thus ride away. But before that he says that I must put on his clothes, his pantalones and
camisa and hat, and ride away on his horse from the jacal as far as the big road beyond the
crossing and back again. This before he goes, so he can tell if I am true and if men are hidden
to shoot him. It is a terrible thing. An hour before daybreak this is to be. Come, my dear one,
and kill this man and take me for your Tonia. Do not try to take hold of him alive, but kill him
quickly. Knowing all, you should do that. You must come long before the time and hide
yourself in the little shed near the jacal where the wagon and saddles are kept. It is dark in
there. He will wear my red skirt and blue waist and brown mantilla. I send you a hundred
kisses. Come surely and shoot quickly and straight.
Thine Own Tonia.
Sandridge quickly explained to his men the official part of the missive. The rangers
protested against his going alone.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him easy enough,&rdquo; said the lieutenant. &ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s got him trapped. And don&rsquo;t
even think he&rsquo;ll get the drop on me.&rdquo;
Sandridge saddled his horse and rode to the Lone Wolf Crossing. He tied his big dun in a
clump of brush on the arroyo, took his Winchester from its scabbard, and carefully
approached the Perez jacal. There was only the half of a high moon drifted over by ragged,
milk-white gulf clouds.
The wagon-shed was an excellent place for ambush; and the ranger got inside it safely.
In the black shadow of the brush shelter in front of the jacal he could see a horse tied and
hear him impatiently pawing the hard-trodden earth.He waited almost an hour before two figures came out of the jacal. One, in man&rsquo;s
clothes, quickly mounted the horse and galloped past the wagon-shed toward the crossing
and village. And then the other figure, in skirt, waist, and mantilla over its head, stepped out
into the faint moonlight, gazing after the rider. Sandridge thought he would take his chance
then before Tonia rode back. He fancied she might not care to see it.
&ldquo;Throw up your hands,&rdquo; he ordered loudly, stepping out of the wagon- shed with his
Winchester at his shoulder.
There was a quick turn of the figure, but no movement to obey, so the ranger pumped
in the bullets&ndash;one&ndash;two&ndash;three&ndash;and then twice more; for you never could be too sure of
bringing down the Cisco Kid. There was no danger of missing at ten paces, even in that half
moonlight.
The old ancestor, asleep on his blanket, was awakened by the shots. Listening further,
he heard a great cry from some man in mortal distress or anguish, and rose up grumbling at
the disturbing ways of moderns.
The tall, red ghost of a man burst into the jacal, reaching one hand, shaking like a tule
reed, for the lantern hanging on its nail. The other spread a letter on the table.
&ldquo;Look at this letter, Perez,&rdquo; cried the man. &ldquo;Who wrote it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah, Dios! it is Senor Sandridge,&rdquo; mumbled the old man, approaching. &ldquo;Pues, senor,
that letter was written by &lsquo;El Chivato,&rsquo; as he is called&ndash;by the man of Tonia. They say he is a
bad man; I do not know. While Tonia slept he wrote the letter and sent it by this old hand of
mine to Domingo Sales to be brought to you. Is there anything wrong in the letter? I am very
old; and I did not know. Valgame Dios! it is a very foolish world; and there is nothing in the
house to drink&ndash; nothing to drink.&rdquo;
Just then all that Sandridge could think of to do was to go outside and throw himself
face downward in the dust by the side of his humming-bird, of whom not a feather fluttered.
He was not a caballero by instinct, and he could not understand the niceties of revenge.
A mile away the rider who had ridden past the wagon-shed struck up a harsh, untuneful
song, the words of which began:
Don&rsquo;t you monkey with my Lulu girl
Or I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do&ndash;The Cactus （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The most notable thing about Time is that it is so purely relative. A large amount of
reminiscence is, by common consent, conceded to the drowning man; and it is not past
belief that one may review an entire courtship while removing one&rsquo;s gloves.
That is what Trysdale was doing, standing by a table in his bachelor apartments. On the
table stood a singular-looking green plant in a red earthen jar. The plant was one of the
species of cacti, and was provided with long, tentacular leaves that perpetually swayed with
the slightest breeze with a peculiar beckoning motion.
Trysdale&rsquo;s friend, the brother of the bride, stood at a sideboard complaining at being
allowed to drink alone. Both men were in evening dress. White favors like stars upon their
coats shone through the gloom of the apartment.
As he slowly unbuttoned his gloves, there passed through Trysdale&rsquo;s mind a swift,
scarifying retrospect of the last few hours. It seemed that in his nostrils was still the scent of
the flowers that had been banked in odorous masses about the church, and in his ears the
lowpitched hum of a thousand well-bred voices, the rustle of crisp garments, and, most
insistently recurring, the drawling words of the minister irrevocably binding her to another.
&gt;From this last hopeless point of view he still strove, as if it had become a habit of his
mind, to reach some conjecture as to why and how he had lost her. Shaken rudely by the
uncompromising fact, he had suddenly found himself confronted by a thing he had never
before faced &ndash;his own innermost, unmitigated, arid unbedecked self. He saw all the garbs of
pretence and egoism that he had worn now turn to rags of folly. He shuddered at the
thought that to others, before now, the garments of his soul must have appeared sorry and
threadbare. Vanity and conceit? These were the joints in his armor. And how free from
either she had always been&ndash;But why&ndash;
As she had slowly moved up the aisle toward the altar he had felt an unworthy, sullen
exultation that had served to support him. He had told himself that her paleness was from
thoughts of another than the man to whom she was about to give herself. But even that
poor consolation had been wrenched from him. For, when he saw that swift, limpid, upward
look that she gave the man when he took her hand, he knew himself to be forgotten. Once
that same look had been raised to him, and he had gauged its meaning. Indeed, his conceit
had crumbled; its last prop was gone. Why had it ended thus? There had been no quarrel
between them, nothing&ndash;
For the thousandth time he remarshalled in his mind the events of those last few days
before the tide had so suddenly turned.She had always insisted upon placing him upon a pedestal, and he had accepted her
homage with royal grandeur. It had been a very sweet incense that she had burned before
him; so modest (he told himself); so childlike and worshipful, and (he would once have
sworn) so sincere. She had invested him with an almost supernatural number of high
attributes and excellencies and talents, and he had absorbed the oblation as a desert drinks
the rain that can coax from it no promise of blossom or fruit.
As Trysdale grimly wrenched apart the seam of his last glove, the crowning instance of
his fatuous and tardily mourned egoism came vividly back to him. The scene was the night
when he had asked her to come up on his pedestal with him and share his greatness. He
could not, now, for the pain of it, allow his mind to dwell upon the memory of her
convincing beauty that night&ndash;the careless wave of her hair, the tenderness and virginal
charm of her looks and words. But they had been enough, and they had brought him to
speak. During their conversation she had said:
&ldquo;And Captain Carruthers tells me that you speak the Spanish language like a native.
Why have you hidden this accomplishment from me? Is there anything you do not know?&rdquo;
Now, Carruthers was an idiot. No doubt he (Trysdale) had been guilty (he sometimes
did such things) of airing at the club some old, canting Castilian proverb dug from the
hotchpotch at the back of dictionaries. Carruthers, who was one of his incontinent admirers,
was the very man to have magnified this exhibition of doubtful erudition.
But, alas! the incense of her admiration had been so sweet and flattering. He allowed
the imputation to pass without denial. Without protest, he allowed her to twine about his
brow this spurious bay of Spanish scholarship. He let it grace his conquering head, and,
among its soft convolutions, he did not feel the prick of the thorn that was to pierce him
later.
How glad, how shy, how tremulous she was! How she fluttered like a snared bird when
he laid his mightiness at her feet! He could have sworn, and he could swear now, that
unmistakable consent was in her eyes, but, coyly, she would give him no direct answer. &ldquo;I
will send you my answer to-morrow,&rdquo; she said; and he, the indulgent, confident victor,
smilingly granted the delay. The next day he waited, impatient, in his rooms for the word. At
noon her groom came to the door and left the strange cactus in the red earthen jar. There
was no note, no message, merely a tag upon the plant bearing a barbarous foreign or
botanical name. He waited until night, but her answer did not come. His large pride and hurt
vanity kept him from seeking her. Two evenings later they met at a dinner. Their greetings
were conventional, but she looked at him, breathless, wondering, eager. He was courteous,
adamant, waiting her explanation. With womanly swiftness she took her cue from his
manner, and turned to snow and ice. Thus, and wider from this on, they had drifted apart.
Where was his fault? Who had been to blame? Humbled now, he sought the answer amid
the ruins of his self-conceit. If&ndash;The voice of the other man in the room, querulously intruding upon his thoughts,
aroused him.
&ldquo;I say, Trysdale, what the deuce is the matter with you? You look unhappy as if you
yourself had been married instead of having acted merely as an accomplice. Look at me,
another accessory, come two thousand miles on a garlicky, cockroachy banana steamer all
the way from South America to connive at the sacrifice&ndash;please to observe how lightly my
guilt rests upon my shoulders. Only little sister I had, too, and now she&rsquo;s gone. Come now!
take something to ease your conscience.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t drink just now, thanks,&rdquo; said Trysdale.
&ldquo;Your brandy,&rdquo; resumed the other, coming over and joining him, &ldquo;is abominable. Run
down to see me some time at Punta Redonda, and try some of our stuff that old Garcia
smuggles in. It&rsquo;s worth the, trip. Hallo! here&rsquo;s an old acquaintance. Wherever did you rake up
this cactus, Trysdale?&rdquo;
&ldquo;A present,&rdquo; said Trysdale, &ldquo;from a friend. Know the species?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Very well. It&rsquo;s a tropical concern. See hundreds of &lsquo;em around Punta every day. Here&rsquo;s
the name on this tag tied to it. Know any Spanish, Trysdale?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Trysdale, with the bitter wraith of a smile&ndash;&ldquo;Is it Spanish?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes. The natives imagine the leaves are reaching out and beckoning to you. They call it
by this name&ndash;Ventomarme. Name means in English, &lsquo;Come and take me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
The Caliph, Cupid and the Clock （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Prince Michael, of the Electorate of Valleluna, sat on his favourite bench in the park.
The coolness of the September night quickened the life in him like a rare, tonic wine. The
benches were not filled; for park loungers, with their stagnant blood, are prompt to detect
and fly home from the crispness of early autumn. The moon was just clearing the roofs of
the range of dwellings that bounded the quadrangle on the east. Children laughed and
played about the fine- sprayed fountain. In the shadowed spots fauns and hamadryads
wooed, unconscious of the gaze of mortal eyes. A hand organ&ndash;Philomel by the grace of our
stage carpenter, Fancy&ndash;fluted and droned in a side street. Around the enchanted boundaries
of the little park street cars spat and mewed and the stilted trains roared like tigers and lions
prowling for a place to enter. And above the trees shone the great, round, shining face of an
illuminated clock in the tower of an antique public building.Prince Michael&rsquo;s shoes were wrecked far beyond the skill of the carefullest cobbler. The
ragman would have declined any negotiations concerning his clothes. The two weeks&rsquo;
stubble on his face was grey and brown and red and greenish yellow&ndash;as if it had been made
up from individual contributions from the chorus of a musical comedy. No man existed who
had money enough to wear so bad a hat as his.
Prince Michael sat on his favourite bench and smiled. It was a diverting thought to him
that he was wealthy enough to buy every one of those close-ranged, bulky, window-lit
mansions that faced him, if he chose. He could have matched gold, equipages, jewels, art
treasures, estates and acres with any Croesus in this proud city of Manhattan, and scarcely
have entered upon the bulk of his holdings. He could have sat at table with reigning
sovereigns. The social world, the world of art, the fellowship of the elect, adulation,
imitation, the homage of the fairest, honours from the highest, praise from the wisest,
flattery, esteem, credit, pleasure, fame&ndash;all the honey of life was waiting in the comb in the
hive of the world for Prince Michael, of the Electorate of Valleluna, whenever he might
choose to take it. But his choice was to sit in rags and dinginess on a bench in a park. For he
had tasted of the fruit of the tree of life, and, finding it bitter in his mouth, had stepped out
of Eden for a time to seek distraction close to the unarmoured, beating heart of the world.
These thoughts strayed dreamily through the mind of Prince Michael, as he smiled
under the stubble of his polychromatic beard. Lounging thus, clad as the poorest of
mendicants in the parks, he loved to study humanity. He found in altruism more pleasure
than his riches, his station and all the grosser sweets of life had given him. It was his chief
solace and satisfaction to alleviate individual distress, to confer favours upon worthy ones
who had need of succour, to dazzle unfortunates by unexpected and bewildering gifts of
truly royal magnificence, bestowed, however, with wisdom and judiciousness.
And as Prince Michael&rsquo;s eye rested upon the glowing face of the great clock in the tower,
his smile, altruistic as it was, became slightly tinged with contempt. Big thoughts were the
Prince&rsquo;s; and it was always with a shake of his head that he considered the subjugation of
the world to the arbitrary measures of Time. The comings and goings of people in hurry and
dread, controlled by the little metal moving hands of a clock, always made him sad.
By and by came a young man in evening clothes and sat upon the third bench from the
Prince. For half an hour he smoked cigars with nervous haste, and then he fell to watching
the face of the illuminated clock above the trees. His perturbation was evident, and the
Prince noted, in sorrow, that its cause was connected, in some manner, with the slowly
moving hands of the timepiece.
His Highness arose and went to the young man&rsquo;s bench.
&ldquo;I beg your pardon for addressing you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I perceive that you are disturbed
in mind. If it may serve to mitigate the liberty I have taken I will add that I am Prince Michael,
heir to the throne of the Electorate of Valleluna. I appear incognito, of course, as you maygather from my appearance. It is a fancy of mine to render aid to others whom I think
worthy of it. Perhaps the matter that seems to distress you is one that would more readily
yield to our mutual efforts.&rdquo;
The young man looked up brightly at the Prince. Brightly, but the perpendicular line of
perplexity between his brows was not smoothed away. He laughed, and even then it did not.
But he accepted the momentary diversion.
&ldquo;Glad to meet you, Prince,&rdquo; he said, good humouredly. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d say you were incog. all
right. Thanks for your offer of assistance&ndash;but I don&rsquo;t see where your butting-in would help
things any. It&rsquo;s a kind of private affair, you know&ndash;but thanks all the same.&rdquo;
Prince Michael sat at the young man&rsquo;s side. He was often rebuffed but never offensively.
His courteous manner and words forbade that.
&ldquo;Clocks,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;are shackles on the feet of mankind. I have observed you
looking persistently at that clock. Its face is that of a tyrant, its numbers are false as those on
a lottery ticket; its hands are those of a bunco steerer, who makes an appointment with you
to your ruin. Let me entreat you to throw off its humiliating bonds and to cease to order
your affairs by that insensate monitor of brass and steel.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t usually,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I carry a watch except when I&rsquo;ve got my radiant
rags on.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know human nature as I do the trees and grass,&rdquo; said the Prince, with earnest dignity.
&ldquo;I am a master of philosophy, a graduate in art, and I hold the purse of a Fortunatus. There
are few mortal misfortunes that I cannot alleviate or overcome. I have read your
countenance, and found in it honesty and nobility as well as distress. I beg of you to accept
my advice or aid. Do not belie the intelligence I see in your face by judging from my
appearance of my ability to defeat your troubles.&rdquo;
The young man glanced at the clock again and frowned darkly. When his gaze strayed
from the glowing horologue of time it rested intently upon a four-story red brick house in
the row of dwellings opposite to where he sat. The shades were drawn, and the lights in
many rooms shone dimly through them.
&ldquo;Ten minutes to nine!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man, with an impatient gesture of despair.
He turned his back upon the house and took a rapid step or two in a contrary direction.
&ldquo;Remain!&rdquo; commanded Prince Michael, in so potent a voice that the disturbed one
wheeled around with a somewhat chagrined laugh.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give her the ten minutes and then I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; he muttered, and then aloud to the
Prince: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join you in confounding all clocks, my friend, and throw in women, too.&rdquo;&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said the Prince calmly. &ldquo;I do not accept your addition. Women are the
natural enemies of clocks, and, therefore, the allies of those who would seek liberation from
these monsters that measure our follies and limit our pleasures. If you will so far confide in
me I would ask you to relate to me your story.&rdquo;
The young man threw himself upon the bench with a reckless laugh.
&ldquo;Your Royal Highness, I will,&rdquo; he said, in tones of mock deference. &ldquo;Do you see yonder
house&ndash;the one with three upper windows lighted? Well, at 6 o&rsquo;clock I stood in that house
with the young lady I am&ndash; that is, I was&ndash;engaged to. I had been doing wrong, my dear
Prince&ndash; I had been a naughty boy, and she had heard of it. I wanted to be forgiven, of
course&ndash;we are always wanting women to forgive us, aren&rsquo;t we, Prince?&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I want time to think it over,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;There is one thing certain; I will either fully
forgive you, or I will never see your face again. There will be no half-way business. At
half-past eight,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;at exactly half-past eight you may be watching the middle upper
window of the top floor. If I decide to forgive I will hang out of that window a white silk scarf.
You will know by that that all is as was before, and you may come to me. If you see no scarf
you may consider that everything between us is ended forever.&rsquo; That,&rdquo; concluded the young
man bitterly, &ldquo;is why I have been watching that clock. The time for the signal to appear has
passed twenty- three minutes ago. Do you wonder that I am a little disturbed, my Prince of
Rags and Whiskers?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Let me repeat to you,&rdquo; said Prince Michael, in his even, well- modulated tones, &ldquo;that
women are the natural enemies of clocks. Clocks are an evil, women a blessing. The signal
may yet appear.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Never, on your principality!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man, hopelessly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know
Marian&ndash;of course. She&rsquo;s always on time, to the minute. That was the first thing about her
that attracted me. I&rsquo;ve got the mitten instead of the scarf. I ought to have known at 8.31 that
my goose was cooked. I&rsquo;ll go West on the 11.45 to-night with Jack Milburn. The jig&rsquo;s up. I&rsquo;ll
try Jack&rsquo;s ranch awhile and top off with the Klondike and whiskey.
Good-night&ndash;er&ndash;er&ndash;Prince.&rdquo;
Prince Michael smiled his enigmatic, gentle, comprehending smile and caught the coat
sleeve of the other. The brilliant light in the Prince&rsquo;s eyes was softening to a dreamier, cloudy
translucence.
&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;till the clock strikes. I have wealth and power and knowledge
above most men, but when the clock strikes I am afraid. Stay by me until then. This woman
shall be yours. You have the word of the hereditary Prince of Valleluna. On the day of your
marriage I will give you $100,000 and a palace on the Hudson. But there must be no clocks
in that palace&ndash;they measure our follies and limit our pleasures. Do you agree to that?&ldquo;&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the young man, cheerfully, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re a nuisance, anyway&ndash;always ticking
and striking and getting you late for dinner.&rdquo;
He glanced again at the clock in the tower. The hands stood at three minutes to nine.
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Prince Michael, &ldquo;that I will sleep a little. The day has been fatiguing.&rdquo;
He stretched himself upon a bench with the manner of one who had slept thus before.
&ldquo;You will find me in this park on any evening when the weather is suitable,&rdquo; said the
Prince, sleepily. &ldquo;Come to me when your marriage day is set and I will give you a cheque for
the money.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thanks, Your Highness,&rdquo; said the young man, seriously. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look as if I would
need that palace on the Hudson, but I appreciate your offer, just the same.&rdquo;
Prince Michael sank into deep slumber. His battered hat rolled from the bench to the
ground. The young man lifted it, placed it over the frowsy face and moved one of the
grotesquely relaxed limbs into a more comfortable position. &ldquo;Poor devil!&rdquo; he said, as he
drew the tattered clothes closer about the Prince&rsquo;s breast.
Sonorous and startling came the stroke of 9 from the clock tower. The young man
sighed again, turned his face for one last look at the house of his relinquished hopes&ndash;and
cried aloud profane words of holy rapture.
From the middle upper window blossomed in the dusk a waving, snowy, fluttering,
wonderful, divine emblem of forgiveness and promised joy.
By came a citizen, rotund, comfortable, home-hurrying, unknowing of the delights of
waving silken scarfs on the borders of dimly-lit parks.
&ldquo;Will you oblige me with the time, sir?&rdquo; asked the young man; and the citizen, shrewdly
conjecturing his watch to be safe, dragged it out and announced:
&ldquo;Twenty-nine and a half minutes past eight, sir.&rdquo;
And then, from habit, he glanced at the clock in the tower, and made further oration.
&ldquo;By George! that clock&rsquo;s half an hour fast! First time in ten years I&rsquo;ve known it to be off.
This watch of mine never varies a&ndash;&rdquo;
But the citizen was talking to vacancy. He turned and saw his hearer, a fast receding
black shadow, flying in the direction of a house with three lighted upper windows.And in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats they owned.
The park was deserted save for one dilapidated figure that sprawled, asleep, on a bench.
They stopped and gazed upon it.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dopy Mike,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;He hits the pipe every night. Park bum for twenty years. On
his last legs, I guess.&rdquo;
The other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp in the hand
of the sleeper.
&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s doped out a fifty-dollar bill, anyway. Wish I knew the brand
of hop that he smokes.&rdquo;
And then &ldquo;Rap, rap, rap!&rdquo; went the club of realism against the shoe soles of Prince
Michael, of the Electorate of Valleluna.
A Call Loan （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>In those days the cattlemen were the anointed. They were the grandees of the grass,
kings of the kine, lords of the lea, barons of beef and bone. They might have ridden in
golden chariots had their tastes so inclined. The cattleman was caught in a stampede of
dollars. It seemed to him that he had more money than was decent. But when he had
bought a watch with precious stones set in the case so large that they hurt his ribs, and a
California saddle with silver nails and Angora skin suaderos, and ordered everybody up to
the bar for whisky&ndash;what else was there for him to spend money for?
Not so circumscribed in expedient for the reduction of surplus wealth were those lairds
of the lariat who had womenfolk to their name. In the breast of the rib-sprung sex the
genius of purse lightening may slumber through years of inopportunity, but never, my
brothers, does it become extinct.
So, out of the chaparral came Long Bill Longley from the Bar Circle Branch on the Frio&ndash;a
wife-driven man&ndash;to taste the urban joys of success. Something like half a million dollars he
had, with an income steadily increasing.
Long Bill was a graduate of the camp and trail. Luck and thrift, a cool head, and a
telescopic eye for mavericks had raised him from cowboy to be a cowman. Then came the
boom in cattle, and Fortune, stepping gingerly among the cactus thorns, came and emptied
her cornucopia at the doorstep of the ranch.In the little frontier city of Chaparosa, Longley built a costly residence. Here he became
a captive, bound to the chariot of social existence. He was doomed to become a leading
citizen. He struggled for a time like a mustang in his first corral, and then he hung up his
quirt and spurs. Time hung heavily on his hands. He organised the First National Bank of
Chaparosa, and was elected its president.
One day a dyspeptic man, wearing double-magnifying glasses, inserted an
official-looking card between the bars of the cashier&rsquo;s window of the First National Bank.
Five minutes later the bank force was dancing at the beck and call of a national bank
examiner.
This examiner, Mr. J. Edgar Todd, proved to be a thorough one.
At the end of it all the examiner put on his hat, and called the president, Mr. William R.
Longley, into the private office.
&ldquo;Well, how do you find things?&rdquo; asked Longley, in his slow, deep tones. &ldquo;Any brands in
the round-up you didn&rsquo;t like the looks of?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The bank checks up all right, Mr. Longley,&rdquo; said Todd; &ldquo;and I find your loans in very
good shape&ndash;with one exception. You are carrying one very bad bit of paper&ndash;one that is so
bad that I have been thinking that you surely do not realise the serious position it places you
in. I refer to a call loan of $10,000 made to Thomas Merwin. Not only is the amount in
excess of the maximum sum the bank can loan any individual legally, but it is absolutely
without endorsement or security. Thus you have doubly violated the national banking laws,
and have laid yourself open to criminal prosecution by the Government. A report of the
matter to the Comptroller of the Currency&ndash;which I am bound to make&ndash;would, I am sure,
result in the matter being turned over to the Department of Justice for action. You see what
a serious thing it is.&rdquo;
Bill Longley was leaning his lengthy, slowly moving frame back in his swivel chair. His
hands were clasped behind his head, and he turned a little to look the examiner in the face.
The examiner was surprised to see a smile creep about the rugged mouth of the banker, and
a kindly twinkle in his light-blue eyes. If he saw the seriousness of the affair, it did not show
in his countenance.
&ldquo;Of course, you don&rsquo;t know Tom Merwin,&rdquo; said Longley, almost genially. &ldquo;Yes, I know
about that loan. It hasn&rsquo;t any security except Tom Merwin&rsquo;s word. Somehow, I&rsquo;ve always
found that when a man&rsquo;s word is good it&rsquo;s the best security there is. Oh, yes, I know the
Government doesn&rsquo;t think so. I guess I&rsquo;ll see Tom about that note.&rdquo;
Mr. Todd&rsquo;s dyspepsia seemed to grow suddenly worse. He looked at the chaparral
banker through his double-magnifying glasses in amazement.&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Longley, easily explaining the thing away, &ldquo;Tom heard of 2000 head of
two-year-olds down near Rocky Ford on the Rio Grande that could be had for $8 a head. I
reckon &lsquo;twas one of old Leandro Garcia&rsquo;s outfits that he had smuggled over, and he wanted
to make a quick turn on &lsquo;em. Those cattle are worth $15 on the hoof in Kansas City. Tom
knew it and I knew it. He had $6,000, and I let him have the $10,000 to make the deal with.
His brother Ed took &lsquo;em on to market three weeks ago. He ought to be back &lsquo;most any day
now with the money. When he comes Tom&rsquo;ll pay that note.&rdquo;
The bank examiner was shocked. It was, perhaps, his duty to step out to the telegraph
office and wire the situation to the Comptroller. But he did not. He talked pointedly and
effectively to Longley for three minutes. He succeeded in making the banker understand that
he stood upon the border of a catastrophe. And then he offered a tiny loophole of escape.
&ldquo;I am going to Hilldale&rsquo;s to-night,&rdquo; he told Longley, &ldquo;to examine a bank there. I will pass
through Chaparosa on my way back. At twelve o&rsquo;clock to-morrow I shall call at this bank. If
this loan has been cleared out of the way by that time it will not be mentioned in my report.
If not&ndash;I will have to do my duty.&rdquo;
With that the examiner bowed and departed.
The President of the First National lounged in his chair half an hour longer, and then he
lit a mild cigar, and went over to Tom Merwin&rsquo;s house. Merwin, a ranchman in brown duck,
with a contemplative eye, sat with his feet upon a table, plaiting a rawhide quirt.
&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said Longley, leaning against the table, &ldquo;you heard anything from Ed yet?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Merwin, continuing his plaiting. &ldquo;I guess Ed&rsquo;ll be along back now in a few
days.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There was a bank examiner,&rdquo; said Longley, &ldquo;nosing around our place to-day, and he
bucked a sight about that note of yours. You know I know it&rsquo;s all right, but the thing is
against the banking laws. I was pretty sure you&rsquo;d have paid it off before the bank was
examined again, but the son-of-a-gun slipped in on us, Tom. Now, I&rsquo;m short of cash myself
just now, or I&rsquo;d let you have the money to take it up with. I&rsquo;ve got till twelve o&rsquo;clock
to-morrow, and then I&rsquo;ve got to show the cash in place of that note or&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Or what, Bill?&rdquo; asked Merwin, as Longley hesitated.
&ldquo;Well, I suppose it means be jumped on with both of Uncle Sam&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to raise the money for you on time,&rdquo; said Merwin, interested in his plaiting.&ldquo;All right, Tom,&rdquo; concluded Longley, as he turned toward the door; &ldquo;I knew you would if
you could.&rdquo;
Merwin threw down his whip and went to the only other bank in town, a private one,
run by Cooper &amp; Craig.
&ldquo;Cooper,&rdquo; he said, to the partner by that name, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to have $10,000 to-day or
to-morrow. I&rsquo;ve got a house and lot there that&rsquo;s worth about $6,000 and that&rsquo;s all the actual
collateral. But I&rsquo;ve got a cattle deal on that&rsquo;s sure to bring me in more than that much profit
within a few days.&rdquo;
Cooper began to cough.
&ldquo;Now, for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t say no,&rdquo; said Merwin. &ldquo;I owe that much money on a call loan.
It&rsquo;s been called, and the man that called it is a man I&rsquo;ve laid on the same blanket with in
cow-camps and ranger-camps for ten years. He can call anything I&rsquo;ve got. He can call the
blood out of my veins and it&rsquo;ll come. He&rsquo;s got to have the money. He&rsquo;s in a devil of a&ndash;Well,
he needs the money, and I&rsquo;ve got to get it for him. You know my word&rsquo;s good, Cooper.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No doubt of it,&rdquo; assented Cooper, urbanely, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve a partner, you know. I&rsquo;m not free
in making loans. And even if you had the best security in your hands, Merwin, we couldn&rsquo;t
accommodate you in less than a week. We&rsquo;re just making a shipment of $15,000 to Myer
Brothers in Rockdell, to buy cotton with. It goes down on the narrow-gauge to-night. That
leaves our cash quite short at present. Sorry we can&rsquo;t arrange it for you.&rdquo;
Merwin went back to his little bare office and plaited at his quirt again. About four
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon he went to the First National Bank and leaned over the railing of
Longley&rsquo;s desk.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to get that money for you to-night&ndash;I mean to-morrow, Bill.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right, Tom,&rdquo; said Longley quietly.
At nine o&rsquo;clock that night Tom Merwin stepped cautiously out of the small frame house
in which he lived. It was near the edge of the little town, and few citizens were in the
neighbourhood at that hour. Merwin wore two six-shooters in a belt, and a slouch hat. He
moved swiftly down a lonely street, and then followed the sandy road that ran parallel to
the narrow-gauge track until he reached the water- tank, two miles below the town. There
Tom Merwin stopped, tied a black silk handkerchief about the lower part of his face, and
pulled his hat down low.
In ten minutes the night train for Rockdell pulled up at the tank, having come from
Chaparosa.With a gun in each hand Merwin raised himself from behind a clump of chaparral and
started for the engine. But before he had taken three steps, two long, strong arms clasped
him from behind, and he was lifted from his feet and thrown, face downward upon the grass.
There was a heavy knee pressing against his back, and an iron hand grasping each of his
wrists. He was held thus, like a child, until the engine had taken water, and until the train
had moved, with accelerating speed, out of sight. Then he was released, and rose to his feet
to face Bill Longley.
&ldquo;The case never needed to be fixed up this way, Tom,&rdquo; said Longley. &ldquo;I saw Cooper this
evening, and he told me what you and him talked about. Then I went down to your house
to-night and saw you come out with your guns on, and I followed you. Let&rsquo;s go back, Tom.&rdquo;
They walked away together, side by side.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Twas the only chance I saw,&rdquo; said Merwin presently. &ldquo;You called your loan, and I tried
to answer you. Now, what&rsquo;ll you do, Bill, if they sock it to you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What would you have done if they&rsquo;d socked it to you?&rdquo; was the answer Longley made.
&ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d lay in a bush to stick up a train,&rdquo; remarked Merwin; &ldquo;but a call
loan&rsquo;s different. A call&rsquo;s a call with me. We&rsquo;ve got twelve hours yet, Bill, before this spy jumps
onto you. We&rsquo;ve got to raise them spondulicks somehow. Maybe we can&ndash;Great Sam
Houston! do you hear that?&rdquo;
Merwin broke into a run, and Longley kept with him, hearing only a rather pleasing
whistle somewhere in the night rendering the lugubrious air of &ldquo;The Cowboy&rsquo;s Lament.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only tune he knows,&rdquo; shouted Merwin, as he ran. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet&ndash;&rdquo;
They were at the door of Merwin&rsquo;s house. He kicked it open and fell over an old valise
lying in the middle of the floor. A sunburned, firm-jawed youth, stained by travel, lay upon
the bed puffing at a brown cigarette.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the word, Ed?&rdquo; gasped Merwin.
&ldquo;So, so,&rdquo; drawled that capable youngster. &ldquo;Just got in on the 9:30. Sold the bunch for
fifteen, straight. Now, buddy, you want to quit kickin&rsquo; a valise around that&rsquo;s got $29,000 in
greenbacks in its in&rsquo;ards.&rdquo;
The Call Of The Tame （O·Henry）
___________________________________________When the inauguration was accomplished - the proceedings were made smooth by the
presence of the Rough Riders - it is well known that a herd of those competent and loyal
ex-warrriors paid a visit to the big city. The newspaper reporters dug out of their trunks the
old broad-brimmed hats and leather belts that they wear to North Beach fish fries, and
mixed with the visitors. No damage was done beyond the employment of the wonderful
plural &ldquo;tenderfeet&rdquo; in each of the scribe&rsquo;s stories. The Westerners mildly contemplated the
skyscrapers as high as the third story, yawned at Broadway, hunched down in the big chairs
in hotel corridors, and altogether looked as bored and dejected as a member of Ye Ancient
and Honorable Artillery separated during a sham battle from his valet.
Out of this sightseeing delegations of good King Teddy&rsquo;s Gentlemen of the Royal
Bear-hounds dropped one Greenbrier Nye, of Pin Feather, Ariz.
The daily cyclone of Sixth Avenue&rsquo;s rush hour swept him away from the company of his
pardners true. The dust from a thousand rustling skirts filled his eyes. The mighty roar of
trains rushing across the sky deafened him. The lightning-flash of twice ten hundred
beaming eyes confused his vision.
The storm was so sudden and tremendous that Greenbrier&rsquo;s first impulse was to lie
down and grab a root. And then he remembered that the disturbance was human, and not
elemental; and he backed out of it with a grin into a doorway.
The reporters had written that but for the widebrimmed hats the West was not visible
upon these gauchos of the North. Heaven sharpen their eyes! The suit of black diagonal,
wrinkled in impossible places; the bright blue four-in-hand, factory tied; the low,
turned-down collar, pattern of the days of Seymour and Blair, white glazed as the letters on
the window of the open-day-and-night-except-Sunday restaurants; the out-curve at the
knees from the saddle grip; the peculiar spread of the half-closed right thumb and fingers
from the stiff hold upon the circling lasso; the deeply absorbed weather tan that the hottest
sun of Cape May can never equal; the seldom-winking blue eyes that unconsciously divided
the rushing crowds into fours, as though they were being counted out of a corral; the
segregated loneliness and solemnity of expression, as of an Emperor or of one whose
horizons have not intruded upon him nearer than a day&rsquo;s ride - these brands of the West
were set upon Greenbrier Nye. Oh, yes; he wore a broadbrimmed hat, gentle reader - just
like those the Madison Square Post Office mail carriers wear when they go up to Bronx Park
on Sunday afternoons.
Suddenly Greenbrier Nye jumped into the drifting herd of metropolitan cattle, seized
upon a man, dragged him out of the stream and gave him a buffet upon his collarbone that
sent him reeling against a wall.
The victim recovered his hat, with the angry look of a New Yorker who has suffered an
outrage and intends to write to the Trib. about it. But he looked at his assailant, and knew
that the blow was in consideration of love and affection after the manner of the West, whichgreets its friends with contumely and uproar and pounding fists, and receives its enemies in
decorum and order, such as the judicious placing of the welcoming bullet demands.
&ldquo;God in the mountains!&rdquo; cried Greenbrier, holding fast to the foreleg of his cull. &ldquo;Can
this be Longhorn Merritt?&rdquo;
The other man was - oh, look on Broadway any day for the pattern - business man -
latest rolled-brim derby - good barber, business, digestion and tailor.
&ldquo;Greenbrier Nye!&rdquo; he exclaimed, grasping the hand that had smitten him. &ldquo;My dear
fellow! So glad to see you! How did you come to - oh, to be sure - the inaugural ceremonies -
I remember you joined the Rough Riders. You must come and have luncheon with me, of
course.&rdquo;
Greenbrier pinned him sadly but firmly to the wall with a hand the size, shape and color
of a McClellan saddle.
&ldquo;Longy,&rdquo; he said, in a melancholy voice that disturbed traffic, &ldquo;what have they been
doing to you? You act just like a citizen. They done made you into an inmate of the city
directory. You never made no such Johnny Branch execration of yourself as that out on the
Gila. &lsquo;Come and have lunching with me!&rsquo; You never defined grub by any such terms of
reproach in them days.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been living in New York seven years,&rdquo; said Merritt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been eight since we
punched cows together in Old Man Garcia&rsquo;s outfit. Well, let&rsquo;s go to a cafe, anyhow. It sounds
good to hear it called &lsquo;grub&rsquo; again.&rdquo;
They picked their way through the crowd to a hotel, and drifted, as by a natural law, to
the bar.
&ldquo;Speak up,&rdquo; invited Greenbrier.
&ldquo;A dry Martini,&rdquo; said Merritt.
&ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; cried Greenbrier; &ldquo;and yet me and you once saw the same pink Gila
monsters crawling up the walls of the same hotel in Canon Diablo! A dry - but let that pass.
Whiskey straight - and they&rsquo;re on you.&rdquo;
Merritt smiled, and paid.
They lunched in a small extension of the dining room that connected with the cafe.
Merritt dexterously diverted his friend&rsquo;s choice, that hovered over ham and eggs, to a puree
of celery, a salmon cutlet, a partridge pie and a desirable salad.&ldquo;On the day,&rdquo; said Greenbrier, grieved and thunderous, &ldquo;when I can&rsquo;t hold but one drink
before eating when I meet a friend I ain&rsquo;t seen in eight years at a 2 by 4 table in a thirty-cent
town at 1 o&rsquo;clock on the third day of the week, I want nine broncos to kick me forty times
over a 640-acre section of land. Get them statistics?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Right, old man,&rdquo; laughed Merritt. &ldquo;Waiter, bring an absinthe frapp&rsquo;e and - what&rsquo;s yours,
Greenbrier?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Whiskey straight,&rdquo; mourned Nye. &ldquo;Out of the neck of a bottle you used to take it,
Longy - straight out of the neck of a bottle on a galloping pony - Arizona redeye, not this ab -
oh, what&rsquo;s the use? They&rsquo;re on you.&rdquo;
Merritt slipped the wine card under his glass.
&ldquo;All right. I suppose you think I&rsquo;m spoiled by the city. I&rsquo;m as good a Westerner as you
are, Greenbrier; but, somehow, I can&rsquo;t make up my mind to go back out there. New York is
comfortable - comfortable. I make a good living, and I live it. No more wet blankets and
riding herd in snowstorms, and bacon and cold coffee, and blowouts once in six months for
me. I reckon I&rsquo;ll hang out here in the future. We&rsquo;ll take in the theatre to-night, Greenbrier,
and after that we&rsquo;ll dine at -&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you are. Merritt,&rdquo; said Greenbrier, laying one elbow in his salad and
the other in his butter. &ldquo;You are a concentrated, effete, unconditional, short-sleeved,
gotch-eared Miss Sally Walker. God made you perpendicular and suitable to ride straddle
and use cuss words in the original. Wherefore you have suffered his handiwork to elapse by
removing yourself to New York and putting on little shoes tied with strings, and making faces
when you talk. I&rsquo;ve seen you rope and tie a steer in 42 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>. If you was to see one now you&rsquo;d
write to the Police Commissioner about it. And these flapdoodle drinks that you inoculate
your system with - these little essences of cowslip with acorns in &lsquo;em, and paregoric flip -
they ain&rsquo;t anyways in assent with the cordiality of manhood. I hate to see you this way.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, Mr. Greenbrier,&rdquo; said Merritt, with apology in his tone, &ldquo;in a way you are right.
Sometimes I do feel like I was being raised on the bottle. But, I tell you, New York is
comfortable - comfortable. There&rsquo;s something about it - the sights and the crowds, and the
way it changes every day, and the very air of it that seems to tie a one-mile-long stake rope
around a man&rsquo;s neck, with the other end fastened somewhere about Thirty-fourth Street. I
don&rsquo;t know what it is.&rdquo;
&ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; said Greenbrier sadly, &ldquo;and I know. The East has gobbled you up. You was
venison, and now you&rsquo;re veal. You put me in mind of a japonica in a window. You&rsquo;ve been
signed, sealed and diskivered. Requiescat in hoc signo. You make me thirsty.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A green chartreuse here,&rdquo; said Merritt to the waiter.&ldquo;Whiskey straight,&rdquo; sighed Greenbrier, &ldquo;and they&rsquo;re on you, you renegade of the
round-ups.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Guilty, with an application for mercy,&rdquo; said Merritt. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how it is,
Greenbrier. It&rsquo;s so comfortable here that -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Please loan me your smelling salts,&rdquo; pleaded Greenbrier. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t seen you once
bluff three bluffers from Mazatzal City with an empty gun in Phoenix -&rdquo;
Greenbrier&rsquo;s voice died away in pure grief.
&ldquo;Cigars!&rdquo; he called harshly to the waiter, to hide his emotion.
&ldquo;A pack of Turkish cigarettes for mine,&rdquo; said Merritt.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re on you,&rdquo; chanted Greenbrier, struggling to conceal his contempt.
At seven they dined in the Where-to-Dine-Well column.
That evening a galaxy had assembled there. Bright shone the lights o&rsquo;er fair women and
br - let it go, anyhow - brave men. The orchestra played charmingly. Hardly had a tip from a
diner been placed in its hands by a waiter when it would burst forth into soniferousness. The
more beer you contributed to it the more Meyerbeer it gave you. Which is reciprocity.
Merritt put forth exertions on the dinner. Greenbrier was his old friend, and he liked
him. He persuaded him to drink a cocktail.
&ldquo;I take the horehound tea,&rdquo; said Greenbrier, &ldquo;for old times&rsquo; sake. But I&rsquo;d prefer whiskey
straight. They&rsquo;re on you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; said Merritt. &ldquo;Now, run your eye down that bill of fare and see if it seems to
hitch on any of these items.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lay me on my lava bed!&rdquo; said Greenbrier, with bulging eyes. &ldquo;All these specimens of
nutriment in the grub wagon! What&rsquo;s this? Horse with the heaves? I pass. But look along!
Here&rsquo;s truck for twenty roundups all spelled out in different directions. Wait till I see.&rdquo;
The viands ordered, Merritt turned to the wine list.
&ldquo;This Medoc isn&rsquo;t bad,&rdquo; he suggested.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the doc,&rdquo; said Greenbrier. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have whiskey straight. It&rsquo;s on you.&ldquo;Greenbrier looked around the room. The waiter brought things and took dishes away.
He was observing. He saw a New York restaurant crowd enjoying itself.
&ldquo;How was the range when you left the Gila?&rdquo; asked Merritt.
&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; said Greenbrier. &ldquo;You see that lady in the red speckled silk at that table. Well,
she could warm over her beans at my campfire. Yes, the range was good. She looks as nice as
a white mustang I see once on Black River.&rdquo;
When the coffee came, Greenbrier put one foot on the seat of the chair next to him.
&ldquo;You said it was a comfortable town, Longy,&rdquo; he said, meditatively. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a
comfortable town. It&rsquo;s different from the plains in a blue norther. What did you call that
mess in the crock with the handle, Longy? Oh, yes, squabs in a cash roll. They&rsquo;re worth the
roll. That white mustang had just such a way of turning his head and shaking his mane - look
at her, Longy. If I thought I could sell out my ranch at a fair price, I believe I&rsquo;d -
&ldquo;Gyar - song!&rdquo; he suddenly cried, in a voice that paralyzed every knife and fork in the
restaurant.
The waiter dived toward the table.
&ldquo;Two more of them cocktail drinks,&rdquo; ordered Greenbrier.
Merritt looked at him and smiled significantly.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re on me,&rdquo; said Greenbrier, blowing a puff of smoke to the ceiling.
Calloway&rsquo;s Code （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The New York Enterprise sent H. B. Calloway as special correspondent to the
Russo-Japanese-Portsmouth war.
For two months Calloway hung about Yokohama and Tokio, shaking dice with the other
correspondents for drinks of &lsquo;rickshaws &ndash; oh, no, that&rsquo;s something to ride in; anyhow, he
wasn&rsquo;t earning the salary that his paper was paying him. But that was not Calloway&rsquo;s fault.
The little brown men who held the strings of Fate between their fingers were not ready for
the readers of the Enterprise to season their breakfast bacon and eggs with the battles of
the descendants of the gods.But soon the column of correspondents that were to go out with the First Army
tightened their field-glass belts and went down to the Yalu with Kuroki. Calloway was one of
these.
Now, this is no history of the battle of the Yalu River. That has been told in detail by the
correspondents who gazed at the shrapnel smoke rings from a distance of three miles. But,
for justice&rsquo;s sake, let it be understood that the Japanese commander prohibited a nearer
view.
Calloway&rsquo;s feat was accomplished before the battle. What he did was to furnish the
Enterprise with the biggest beat of the war. That paper published exclu- sively and in detail
the news of the attack on the lines of the Russian General on the same day that it was made.
No other paper printed a word about it for two days afterward, except a London paper,
whose account was absolutely incorrect and untrue.
Calloway did this in face of the fact that General Kuroki was making, his moves and
living his plans with the pro- foundest secrecy, as far as the world outside his camps was
concerned. The correspondents were forbidden to send out any news whatever of his plans;
and every message that was allowed on the wires was censored &ndash; with rigid severity.
The correspondent for the London paper handed in a cablegram describing, Kuroki&rsquo;s
plans; but as it was wrong from beginning to end the censor grinned and let it go through.
So, there they were &ndash; Kuroki on one side of the Yalu with forty-two thousand infantry,
five thousand cavalry, and one hundred and twenty-four guns. On the other side, Zassulitch
waited for him with only twenty-three thousand men, and with a long stretch of river to
guard. And Calloway had got hold of some important inside information that he knew would
bring the Enterprise staff around a cablegram as thick as flies around a Park Row lemonade
stand. If he could only get that message past the censor &ndash; the new censor who had arrived
and taken his post that day!
Calloway did the obviously proper thing. He lit his pipe and sat down on a gun carriage
to think it over. And there we must leave him; for the rest of the story belongs to Vesey, a
sixteen-dollar-a-week reporter on the Enterprise.
Calloway&rsquo;s cablegram was handed to the managing editor at four o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon. He read it three times; and then drew a pocket mirror from a pigeon-hole in his
desk, and looked at his reflection carefully. Then he went over to the desk of Boyd, his
assistant (he usually called Boyd when he wanted him), and laid the cablegram before him.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Calloway,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;See what you make of it.&rdquo;
The message was dated at Wi-ju, and these were the words of it:Foregone preconcerted rash witching goes muffled rumour mine dark silent
unfortunate richmond existing great hotly brute select mooted parlous beggars ye angel
incontrovertible.
Boyd read it twice.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s either a cipher or a sunstroke,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Ever hear of anything like a code in the office &ndash; a secret code?&rdquo; asked the m. e., who
had held his desk for only two years. Managing editors come and go.
&ldquo;None except the vernacular that the lady specials write in,&rdquo; said Boyd. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be an
acrostic, could it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; said the m. e., &ldquo;but the beginning letters contain only four vowels. It
must be a code of some sort.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Try em in groups,&rdquo; suggested Boyd. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see &ndash; &lsquo;Rash witching goes&rsquo; &ndash; not with me it
doesn&rsquo;t. &lsquo;Muf- fled rumour mine&rsquo; &ndash; must have an underground wire. &lsquo;Dark silent unfortunate
richmond&rsquo; &ndash; no reason why he should knock that town so hard. &lsquo;Existing great hotly&rsquo; &ndash; no it
doesn&rsquo;t pan out I&rsquo;ll call Scott.&rdquo;
The city editor came in a hurry, and tried his luck. A city editor must know something
about everything; so Scott knew a little about cipher-writing.
&ldquo;It may be what is called an inverted alphabet cipher,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try that. &lsquo;R&rsquo; seems to
be the oftenest used initial letter, with the exception of &rsquo;m.&rsquo; Assuming &lsquo;r&rsquo; to mean &lsquo;e&rsquo;, the
most frequently used vowel, we transpose the letters &ndash; so.&rdquo;
Scott worked rapidly with his pencil for two minutes; and then showed the first word
according to his reading &ndash; the word &ldquo;Scejtzez.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; cried Boyd. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a charade. My first is a Russian general. Go on, Scott.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; said the city editor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s undoubtedly a code. It&rsquo;s impossible to
read it without the key. Has the office ever used a cipher code?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Just what I was asking,&rdquo; said the m.e. &ldquo;Hustle everybody up that ought to know. We
must get at it some way. Calloway has evidently got hold of some- thing big, and the censor
has put the screws on, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have cabled in a lot of chop suey like this.&rdquo;
Throughout the office of the Enterprise a dragnet was sent, hauling in such members of
the staff as would be likely to know of a code, past or present, by reason of their wisdom,
information, natural intelligence, or length of servitude. They got together in a group in thecity room, with the m. e. in the centre. No one had heard of a code. All began to explain to
the head investi- gator that newspapers never use a code, anyhow &ndash; that is, a cipher code.
Of course the Associated Press stuff is a sort of code &ndash; an abbreviation, rather &ndash; but &ndash;
The m. e. knew all that, and said so. He asked each man how long he had worked on
the paper. Not one of them had drawn pay from an Enterprise envelope for longer than six
years. Calloway had been on the paper twelve years. &ldquo;Try old Heffelbauer,&rdquo; said the m. e.
&ldquo;He was here when Park Row was a potato patch.&rdquo;
Heffelbauer was an institution. He was half janitor, half handy-man about the office,
and half watchman &ndash; thus becoming the peer of thirteen and one-half tailors.
Sent for, he came, radiating his nationality. &ldquo;Heffelbauer,&rdquo; said the m. e., &ldquo;did you ever
hear of a code belonging to the office a long time ago - a private code? You know what a
code is, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yah,&rdquo; said Heffelbauer. &ldquo;Sure I know vat a code is. Yah, apout dwelf or fifteen year ago
der office had a code. Der reborters in der city-room haf it here.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the m. e. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting on the trail now. Where was it kept, Heffelbauer?
What do you know about it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Somedimes,&rdquo; said the retainer, &ldquo;dey keep it in der little room behind der library room.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Can you find it asked the m. e. eagerly. &ldquo;Do you know where it is?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mein Gott!&rdquo; said Heffelbauer. &ldquo;How long you dink a code live? Der reborters call him a
maskeet. But von day he butt mit his head der editor, und &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s talking about a goat,&rdquo; said Boyd. &ldquo;Get out, Heffelbauer.&rdquo;
Again discomfited, the concerted wit and resource of the Enterprise huddled around
Calloway&rsquo;s puzzle, con- sidering its mysterious words in vain.
Then Vesey came in.
Vesey was the youngest reporter. He had a thirty- two-inch chest and wore a number
fourteen collar; but his bright Scotch plaid suit gave him presence and con- ferred no
obscurity upon his whereabouts. He wore his hat in such a position that people followed
him about to see him take it off, convinced that it must be hung upon a peg driven into the
back of his head. He was never without an immense, knotted, hard-wood cane with a
German-silver tip on its crooked handle. Vesey was the best photograph hustler in the office.
Scott said it was because no living human being could resist the per- sonal triumph it was to
hand his picture over to Vesey. Vesey always wrote his own news stories, except the big ones,which were sent to the rewrite men. Add to this fact that among all the inhabitants, temples,
and groves of the earth nothing existed that could abash Vesey, and his dim sketch is
concluded.
Vesey butted into the circle of cipher readers very much as Heffelbauer&rsquo;s &ldquo;code&rdquo; would
have done, and asked what was up. Some one explained, with the touch of half-familiar
condescension that they always used toward him. Vesey reached out and took the
cablegram from the m. e.&rsquo;s hand. Under the protection of some special Providence, he was
always doing appalling things like that, and coming, off unscathed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a code,&rdquo; said Vesey. &ldquo;Anybody got the key?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The office has no code,&rdquo; said Boyd, reaching for the message. Vesey held to it.
&ldquo;Then old Callowav expects us to read it, anyhow,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s up a tree, or
something, and he&rsquo;s made this up so as to get it by, the censor. It&rsquo;s up to us. Gee! I wish they
had sell, me, too. Say &ndash; we can&rsquo;t afford to fall down on our end of it. &lsquo;Foregone,
preconcerted rash, witching&rsquo; &ndash; h&rsquo;m.&rdquo;
Vesey sat down on a table corner and began to whistle softly, frowning at the
cablegram.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it, please,&rdquo; said the m. e. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get to work on it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve got a line on it,&rdquo; said Vesey. &ldquo;Give me ten minutes.&rdquo;
He walked to his desk, threw his hat into a waste-basket, spread out flat on his chest
like a gorgeous lizard, and started his pencil going. The wit and wisdom of the Enterprise
remained in a loose group, and smiled at one another, nodding their heads toward Vesey.
Then they began to exchange their theories about the cipher.
It took Vesey exactly fifteen minutes. He brought to the m. e. a pad with the code-key
written on it.
&ldquo;I felt the swing of it as soon as I saw it,&rdquo; said Vesey. &ldquo;Hurrah for old Calloway! He&rsquo;s
done the Japs and every paper in town that prints literature instead of news. Take a look at
that.&rdquo;
Thus had Vesey set forth the reading of the code:
Foregone - conclusion Preconcerted - arrangement Rash - act Witching - hour of
midnight Goes - without saying Muffled - report Rumour - hath it Mine - host Dark - horse
Silent - majority Unfortunate - pedestrians Richmond - in the field Existing - conditionsGreat-White Way Hotly - contested Brute - force Select - few Mooted - question Parlous -</p>

<h2 id="times-beggars-description-ye-correspondent-angel-unawares-incontrovertible-fact">times Beggars - description Ye - correspondent Angel - unawares Incontrovertible - fact</h2>

<p>*Mr. Vesey afterward explained that the logical journalistic complement of the word
&ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; was once the word &ldquo;victim.&rdquo; But, since the automobile be- came so popular,
the correct following word is now pedestrians. Of course, in Calloway&rsquo;s code it meant
infantry.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply newspaper English,&rdquo; explained Vesey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reporting on the Enterprise
long enough to know it by heart. Old Calloway gives us the cue word, and we use the word
that naturally follows it just as we em in the paper. Read it over, and you&rsquo;ll see how pat they
drop into their places. Now, here&rsquo;s the message he intended us to get.&rdquo;
Vesey handed out another sheet of paper.
Concluded arrangement to act at hour of midnight without saying. Report hath it that a
large body of cavalry and an overwhelming force of infantry will be thrown into the field.
Conditions white. Way con- tested by only a small force. Question the Times descrip- tion. Its
correspondent is unaware of the facts.
&ldquo;Great stuff!&rdquo; cried Boyd excitedly. &ldquo;Kuroki crosses the Yalu to-night and attacks. Oh, we
won&rsquo;t do a thing to the sheets that make up with Addison&rsquo;s essays, real estate transfers, and
bowling scores!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mr. Vesey,&rdquo; said the m. e., with his jollying - which - you - should - regard - as - a -
favour manner, &ldquo;you have cast a serious reflection upon the literary standards of the paper
that employs you. You have also assisted materially in giving us the biggest &lsquo;beat&rsquo; of the year.
I will let you know in a day or two whether you are to be discharged or retained at a larger
salary. Somebody send Ames to me.&rdquo;
Ames was the king-pin, the snowy-petalled Marguerite, the star-bright looloo of the
rewrite men. He saw attempted murder in the pains of green-apple colic, cyclones in the
summer zephyr, lost children in every top- spinning urchin, an uprising of the down-trodden
masses in every hurling of a derelict potato at a passing automobile. When not rewriting,
Ames sat on the porch of his Brooklyn villa playing checkers with his ten-year-old son.
Ames and the &ldquo;war editor&rdquo; shut themselves in a room. There was a map in there stuck
full of little pins that represented armies and divisions. Their fingers had been itching for
days to move those pins along the crooked line of the Yalu. They did so now; and in words of
fire Ames translated Calloway&rsquo;s brief message into a front page masterpiece that set the
world talking. He told of the secret councils of the Japanese officers; gave Kuroki&rsquo;s flaming
speeches in full; counted the cavalry and infantry to a man and a horse; described the quick
and silent building, of the bridge at Stuikauchen, across which the Mikado&rsquo;s legions werehurled upon the surprised Zas- sulitch, whose troops were widely scattered along the river.
And the battle! &ndash; well, you know what Ames can do with a battle if you give him just one
smell of smoke for a foundation. And in the same story, with seemingly supernatural
knowledge, he gleefully scored the most profound and ponderous paper in England for the
false and misleading account of the intended movements of the Japanese First Army printed
in its issue of the same date.
Only one error was made; and that was the fault of the cable operator at Wi-ju.
Calloway pointed it out after he came back. The word &ldquo;great&rdquo; in his code should have been
&ldquo;gage,&rdquo; and its complemental words &ldquo;of battle.&rdquo; But it went to Ames &ldquo;conditions white,&rdquo; and
of course he took that to mean snow. His description of the Japanese army strum, struggling
through the snowstorm, blinded by the whirling, flakes, was thrillingly vivid. The artists
turned out some effective illustrations that made a hit as pictures of the artillery dragging
their guns through the drifts. But, as the attack was made on the first day of May,
&ldquo;conditions white&rdquo; excited some amusement. But it in made no difference to the Enterprise,
anyway.
It was wonderful. And Calloway was wonderful in having made the new censor believe
that his jargon of words meant no more than a complaint of the dearth of news and a
petition for more expense money. And Vesey was wonderful. And most wonderful of all are
words, and how they make friends one with another, being oft associated, until not even
obituary notices them do part.
On the second day following, the city editor halted at Vesey&rsquo;s desk where the reporter
was writing the story of a man who had broken his leg by falling into a coal-hole &ndash; Ames
having failed to find a murder motive in it.
&ldquo;The old man says your salary is to be raised to twenty a week,&rdquo; said Scott.
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Vesey. &ldquo;Every little helps. Say &ndash; Mr. Scott, which would you say &ndash; &lsquo;We
can state without fear of successful contradiction,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;On the whole it can be safely
asserted&rsquo;?&rdquo;
A Chaparral Christmas Gift （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The original cause of the trouble was about twenty years in growing.
At the end of that time it was worth it.Had you lived anywhere within fifty miles of Sun- down Ranch you would have heard of
it. It possessed a quantity of jet-black hair, a pair of extremely frank, deep-brown eyes and a
laugh that rippled across the prairie like the sound of a hidden brook. The name of it was
Rosita McMullen; and she was the daughter of old man McMullen of the Sundown Sheep
Ranch.
There came riding on red roan steeds &ndash; or, to be more explicit, on a paint and a
flea-bitten sorrel &ndash; two wooers. One was Madison Lane, and the other was the Frio Kid, But
at that time they did not call him the Frio Kid, for he had not earned the honours of special
nomenclature- His name was simply Johnny McRoy.
It must not be supposed that these two were the sum of the agreeable Rosita&rsquo;s
admirers. The bronchos of a dozen others champed their bits at the long hitching rack of the
Sundown Ranch. Many were the sheeps&rsquo;- eves that were cast in those savannas that did not
belong. to the flocks of Dan McMullen. But of all the cavaliers, Madison Lane and Johnny
MeRoy galloped far ahead, wherefore they are to be chronicled.
Madison Lane, a young cattleman from the Nueces country, won the race. He and
Rosita were married one Christmas day. Armed, hilarious, vociferous, mag- nanimous, the
cowmen and the sheepmen, laying aside their hereditary hatred, joined forces to celebrate
the occasion.
Sundown Ranch was sonorous with the cracking of jokes and sixshooters, the shine of
buckles and bright eyes, the outspoken congratulations of the herders of kine.
But while the wedding feast was at its liveliest there descended upon it Johnny MeRoy,
bitten by jealousy, like one possessed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a Christmas present,&rdquo; he yelled, shrilly, at the door, with his .45 in his hand.
Even then he had some reputation as an offhand shot.
His first bullet cut a neat underbit in Madison Lane&rsquo;s right ear. The barrel of his gun
moved an inch. The next shot would have been the bride&rsquo;s had not Carson, a sheepman,
possessed a mind with triggers somewhat well oiled and in repair. The guns of the wedding
party had been hung, in their belts, upon nails in the wall when they sat at table, as a
concession to good taste. But Carson, with great promptness, hurled his plate of roast
venison and frijoles at McRoy, spoiling his aim. The second bullet, then, only shattered the
white petals of a Spanish dagger flower suspended two feet above Rosita&rsquo;s head.
The guests spurned their chairs and jumped for their weapons. It was considered an
improper act to shoot the bride and groom at a wedding. In about six seconds there were
twenty or so bullets due to be whizzing in the direction of Mr. McRoy.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shoot better next time,&rdquo; yelled Johnny; &ldquo;and there&rsquo;ll be a next time.&rdquo; He backed
rapidly out the door.
Carson, the sheepman, spurred on to attempt further exploits by the success of his
plate-throwing, was first to reach the door. McRoy&rsquo;s bullet from the darkness laid him low.
The cattlemen then swept out upon him, calling for vengeance, for, while the slaughter
of a sheepman has not always lacked condonement, it was a decided mis- demeanour in this
instance. Carson was innocent; he was no accomplice at the matrimonial proceedings; nor
had any one heard him quote the line &ldquo;Christmas comes but once a year&rdquo; to the guests.
But the sortie failed in its vengeance. McRoy was on his horse and away, shouting back
curses and threats as he galloped into the concealing chaparral.
That night was the birthnight of the Frio Kid. He became the &ldquo;bad man&rdquo; of that portion
of the State. The rejection of his suit by Miss McMullen turned him to a dangerous man.
When officers went after him for the shooting of Carson, he killed two of them, and entered
upon the life of an outlaw. He became a marvellous shot with either hand. He would turn up
in towns and settlements, raise a quarrel at the slightest opportunity, pick off his man and
laugh at the officers of the law. He was so cool, so deadly, so rapid, so inhumanly bloodthirsty that none but faint attempts were ever made to capture him. When he was at last
shot and killed by a little one-armed Mexican who was nearly dead himself from fright, the
Frio Kid had the deaths of eighteen men on his head. About half of these were killed in fair
duels depending upon the quickness of the draw. The other half were men whom be
assassinated from absolute wantonness and cruelty.
Many tales are told along the border of his impudent courage and daring. But he was
not one of the breed of desperadoes who have seasons of generosity and even of softness.
They say he never had mercy on the object of his anger. Yet at this and every Christmastide it
is well to give each one credit, if it can be done, for what- ever speck of good he may have
possessed. If the Frio Kid ever did a kindly act or felt a throb of generosity in his heart it was
once at such a time and season, and this is the way it happened.
One who has been crossed in love should never breathe the odour from the blossoms
of the ratama tree. It stirs the memory to a dangerous degree.
One December in the Frio country there was a ratama tree in full bloom, for the winter
had been as warm as springtime. That way rode the Frio Kid and his satellite aW
co-murderer, Mexican Frank. The kid reined in his mustang, and sat in his saddle, thoughtful
and grim, with dangerously narrowing eyes. The rich, sweet scent touched him somewhere
beneath his ice and iron.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve been thinking about, Mex,&rdquo; he remarked in his usual mild drawl,
&ldquo;to have forgot all about a Christmas present I got to give. I&rsquo;m going to ride over to-morrownight and shoot Madison Lane in his own house. He got my girl &ndash; Rosita would have had me
if he hadn&rsquo;t cut into the game. I wonder why I happened to overlook it up to now?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah, shucks, Kid,&rdquo; said Mexican, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk foolish- ness. You know you can&rsquo;t get within
a mile of Mad Lane&rsquo;s house to-morrow night. I see old man Allen day before yesterday, and
he says Mad is going to have Christmas doings at his house. You remember how you shot up
the festivities when Mad was married, and about the threats you made? Don&rsquo;t you suppose
Mad Lane&rsquo;ll kind of keep his eye open for a certain Mr. Kid? You plumb make me tired, Kid,
with such remarks.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; repeated the Frio Kid, without heat, &ldquo;to go to Madison Lane&rsquo;s Christmas
doings, and kill him. I ought to have done it a long time ago. Why, Mex, just two weeks ago I
dreamed me and Rosita was married instead of her and him; and we was living in a house,
and I could see her smiling at me, and &ndash; oh! h&ndash;l, Mex, he got her; and I&rsquo;ll get him &ndash; yes, sir,
on Christmas Eve he got her, and then&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;ll get him.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s other ways of committing suicide,&rdquo; advised Mexican. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go and
surrender to the sheriff?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him,&rdquo; said the Kid.
Christmas Eve fell as balmy as April. Perhaps there was a hint of far-away frostiness in
the air, but it tingles like seltzer, perfumed faintly with late prairie blossoms and the
mesquite grass.
When night came the five or six rooms of the ranch- house were brightly lit. In one
room was a Christmas tree, for the Lanes had a boy of three, and a dozen or more guests
were expected from the nearer ranches.
At nightfall Madison Lane called aside Jim Belcher and three other cowboys employed
on his ranch.
&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; said Lane, &ldquo;keep your eyes open. Walk around the house and watch the
road well. All of you know the &lsquo;Frio Kid,&rsquo; as they call him now, and if you see him, open fire
on him without asking any questions. I&rsquo;m not afraid of his coming around, but Rosita is. She&rsquo;s
been afraid he&rsquo;d come in on us every Christmas since we were married.&rdquo;
The guests had arrived in buckboards and on horseback, and were making themselves
comfortable inside.
The evening went along pleasantly. The guests enjoyed and praised Rosita&rsquo;s excellent
supper, and after- ward the men scattered in groups about the rooms or on the broad
&ldquo;gallery,&rdquo; smoking and chatting.The Christmas tree, of course, delighted the youngsters, and above all were they
pleased when Santa Claus himself in magnificent white beard and furs appeared and began
to distribute the toys.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my papa,&rdquo; announced Billy Sampson, aged six. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him wear &lsquo;em before.&rdquo;
Berkly, a sheepman, an old friend of Lane, stopped Rosita as she was passing by him on
the gallery, where he was sitting smoking.
&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Lane,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I suppose by this Christ- mas you&rsquo;ve gotten over being
afraid of that fellow McRoy, haven&rsquo;t you? Madison and I have talked about it, you know.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Very nearly,&rdquo; said Rosita, smiling, &ldquo;but I am still nervous sometimes. I shall never forget
that awful time when he came so near to killing us.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the most cold-hearted villain in the world,&rdquo; said Berkly. &ldquo;The citizens all along the
border ought to turn out and hunt him down like a wolf.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He has committed awful crimes,&rdquo; said Rosita, but &ndash; I &ndash; don&rsquo;t &ndash; know. I think there is a
spot of good somewhere in everybody. He was not always bad &ndash; that I know.&rdquo;
Rosita turned into the hallway between the rooms. Santa Claus, in muffling whiskers
and furs, was just coming through.
&ldquo;I heard what you said through the window, Mrs. Lane,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was just going down
in my pocket for a Christmas present for your husband. But I&rsquo;ve left one for you, instead. It&rsquo;s
in the room to your right.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, thank you, kind Santa Claus,&rdquo; said Rosita, brightly.
Rosita went into the room, while Santa Claus stepped into the cooler air of the yard.
She found no one in the room but Madison.
&ldquo;Where is my present that Santa said he left for me in here?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen anything in the way of a present,&rdquo; said her husband, laughing, &ldquo;unless he
could have meant me.&rdquo;
The next day Gabriel Radd, the foreman of the X 0 Ranch, dropped into the post-office
at Loma Alta.
&ldquo;Well, the Frio Kid&rsquo;s got his dose of lead at last,&rdquo; he remarked to the postmaster.&ldquo;That so? How&rsquo;d it happen?&rdquo;
&ldquo;One of old Sanchez&rsquo;s Mexican sheep herders did it! &ndash; think of it! the Frio Kid killed bv a
sheep herder! The Greaser saw him riding along past his camp about twelve o&rsquo;clock last
night, and was so skeered that he up with a Winchester and let him have it. Funniest part of
it was that the Kid was dressed all up with white Angora- skin whiskers and a regular Santy
Claus rig-out from head to foot. Think of the Frio Kid playing Santy!&rdquo;
A Chaparral Prince （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Nine o&rsquo;clock at last, and the drudging toil of the day was ended. Lena climbed to her
room in the third half-story of the Quarrymen&rsquo;s Hotel. Since daylight she had slaved, doing
the work of a full-grown woman, scrubbing the floors, washing the heavy ironstone plates
and cups, making the beds, and supplying the insatiate demands for wood and water in that
turbulent and depressing hostelry.
The din of the day&rsquo;s quarrying was over&ndash;the blasting and drilling, the creaking of the
great cranes, the shouts of the foremen, the backing and shifting of the flat-cars hauling the
heavy blocks of limestone. Down in the hotel office three or four of the labourers were
growling and swearing over a belated game of checkers. Heavy odours of stewed meat, hot
grease, and cheap coffee hung like a depressing fog about the house.
Lena lit the stump of a candle and sat limply upon her wooden chair. She was eleven
years old, thin and ill-nourished. Her back and limbs were sore and aching. But the ache in
her heart made the biggest trouble. The last straw had been added to the burden upon her
small shoulders. They had taken away Grimm. Always at night, however tired she might be,
she had turned to Grimm for comfort and hope. Each time had Grimm whispered to her that
the prince or the fairy would come and deliver her out of the wicked enchantment. Every
night she had taken fresh courage and strength from Grimm.
To whatever tale she read she found an analogy in her own condition. The woodcutter&rsquo;s
lost child, the unhappy goose girl, the persecuted stepdaughter, the little maiden imprisoned
in the witch&rsquo;s hut&ndash;all these were but transparent disguises for Lena, the overworked
kitchenmaid in the Quarrymen&rsquo;s Hotel. And always when the extremity was direst came the
good fairy or the gallant prince to the rescue.
So, here in the ogre&rsquo;s castle, enslaved by a wicked spell, Lena had leaned upon Grimm
and waited, longing for the powers of goodness to prevail. But on the day before Mrs.
Maloney had found the book in her room and had carried it away, declaring sharply that it
would not do for servants to read at night; they lost sleep and did not work briskly the nextday. Can one only eleven years old, living away from one&rsquo;s mamma, and never having any
time to play, live entirely deprived of Grimm? Just try it once and you will see what a difficult
thing it is.
Lena&rsquo;s home was in Texas, away up among the little mountains on the Pedernales River,
in a little town called Fredericksburg. They are all German people who live in Fredericksburg.
Of evenings they sit at little tables along the sidewalk and drink beer and play pinochle and
scat. They are very thrifty people.
Thriftiest among them was Peter Hildesmuller, Lena&rsquo;s father. And that is why Lena was
sent to work in the hotel at the quarries, thirty miles away. She earned three dollars every
week there, and Peter added her wages to his well-guarded store. Peter had an ambition to
become as rich as his neighbour, Hugo Heffelbauer, who smoked a meerschaum pipe three
feet long and had wiener schnitzel and hassenpfeffer for dinner every day in the week. And
now Lena was quite old enough to work and assist in the accumulation of riches. But
conjecture, if you can, what it means to be sentenced at eleven years of age from a home in
the pleasant little Rhine village to hard labour in the ogre&rsquo;s castle, where you must fly to
serve the ogres, while they devour cattle and sheep, growling fiercely as they stamp white
limestone dust from their great shoes for you to sweep and scour with your weak, aching
fingers. And then&ndash;to have Grimm taken away from you!
Lena raised the lid of an old empty case that had once contained canned corn and got
out a sheet of paper and a piece of pencil. She was going to write a letter to her mamma.
Tommy Ryan was going to post it for her at Ballinger&rsquo;s. Tommy was seventeen, worked in the
quarries, went home to Ballinger&rsquo;s every night, and was now waiting in the shadows under
Lena&rsquo;s window for her to throw the letter out to him. That was the only way she could send
a letter to Fredericksburg. Mrs. Maloney did not like for her to write letters.
The stump of the candle was burning low, so Lena hastily bit the wood from around the
lead of her pencil and began. This is the letter she wrote:
Dearest Mamma:&ndash;I want so much to see you. And Gretel and Claus and Heinrich and
little Adolf. I am so tired. I want to see you. To-day I was slapped by Mrs. Maloney and had
no supper. I could not bring in enough wood, for my hand hurt. She took my book yesterday.
I mean &ldquo;Grimm&rsquo;s Fairy Tales,&rdquo; which Uncle Leo gave me. It did not hurt any one for me to
read the book. I try to work as well as I can, but there is so much to do. I read only a little bit
every night. Dear mamma, I shall tell you what I am going to do. Unless you send for me
to-morrow to bring me home I shall go to a deep place I know in the river and drown. It is
wicked to drown, I suppose, but I wanted to see you, and there is no one else. I am very
tired, and Tommy is waiting for the letter. You will excuse me, mamma, if I do it.
Your respectful and loving daughter,
Lena.Tommy was still waiting faithfully when the letter was concluded, and when Lena
dropped it out she saw him pick it up and start up the steep hillside. Without undressing she
blew out the candle and curled herself upon the mattress on the floor.
At 10:30 o&rsquo;clock old man Ballinger came out of his house in his stocking feet and leaned
over the gate, smoking his pipe. He looked down the big road, white in the moonshine, and
rubbed one ankle with the toe of his other foot. It was time for the Fredericksburg mail to
come pattering up the road.
Old man Ballinger had waited only a few minutes when he heard the lively hoofbeats of
Fritz&rsquo;s team of little black mules, and very soon afterward his covered spring wagon stood in
front of the gate. Fritz&rsquo;s big spectacles flashed in the moonlight and his tremendous voice
shouted a greeting to the postmaster of Ballinger&rsquo;s. The mail-carrier jumped out and took
the bridles from the mules, for he always fed them oats at Ballinger&rsquo;s.
While the mules were eating from their feed bags old man Ballinger brought out the
mail sack and threw it into the wagon.
Fritz Bergmann was a man of three sentiments&ndash;or to be more accurate&ndash; four, the pair
of mules deserving to be reckoned individually. Those mules were the chief interest and joy
of his existence. Next came the Emperor of Germany and Lena Hildesmuller.
&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Fritz, when he was ready to start, &ldquo;contains the sack a letter to Frau
Hildesmuller from the little Lena at the quarries? One came in the last mail to say that she is
a little sick, already. Her mamma is very anxious to hear again.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said old man Ballinger, &ldquo;thar&rsquo;s a letter for Mrs. Helterskelter, or some sich name.
Tommy Ryan brung it over when he come. Her little gal workin&rsquo; over thar, you say?&rdquo;
&ldquo;In the hotel,&rdquo; shouted Fritz, as he gathered up the lines; &ldquo;eleven years old and not
bigger as a frankfurter. The close-fist of a Peter Hildesmuller!&ndash;some day I shall with a big
club pound that man&rsquo;s dummkopf&ndash;all in and out the town. Perhaps in this letter Lena will
say that she is yet feeling better. So, her mamma will be glad. Auf wiedersehen, Herr
Ballinger&ndash;your feets will take cold out in the night air.&rdquo;
&ldquo;So long, Fritzy,&rdquo; said old man Ballinger. &ldquo;You got a nice cool night for your drive.&rdquo;
Up the road went the little black mules at their steady trot, while Fritz thundered at
them occasional words of endearment and cheer.
These fancies occupied the mind of the mail-carrier until he reached the big post oak
forest, eight miles from Ballinger&rsquo;s. Here his ruminations were scattered by the sudden flash
and report of pistols and a whooping as if from a whole tribe of Indians. A band of galloping
centaurs closed in around the mail wagon. One of them leaned over the front wheel,covered the driver with his revolver, and ordered him to stop. Others caught at the bridles of
Donder and Blitzen.
&ldquo;Donnerwetter!&rdquo; shouted Fritz, with all his tremendous voice&ndash;&ldquo;wass ist? Release your
hands from dose mules. Ve vas der United States mail!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hurry up, Dutch!&rdquo; drawled a melancholy voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know when you&rsquo;re in a
stick-up? Reverse your mules and climb out of the cart.&rdquo;
It is due to the breadth of Hondo Bill&rsquo;s demerit and the largeness of his achievements to
state that the holding up of the Fredericksburg mail was not perpetrated by way of an
exploit. As the lion while in the pursuit of prey commensurate to his prowess might set a
frivolous foot upon a casual rabbit in his path, so Hondo Bill and his gang had swooped
sportively upon the pacific transport of Meinherr Fritz.
The real work of their sinister night ride was over. Fritz and his mail bag and his mules
came as gentle relaxation, grateful after the arduous duties of their profession. Twenty miles
to the southeast stood a train with a killed engine, hysterical passengers and a looted
express and mail car. That represented the serious occupation of Hondo Bill and his gang.
With a fairly rich prize of currency and silver the robbers were making a wide detour to the
west through the less populous country, intending to seek safety in Mexico by means of
some fordable spot on the Rio Grande. The booty from the train had melted the desperate
bushrangers to jovial and happy skylarkers.
Trembling with outraged dignity and no little personal apprehension, Fritz climbed out
to the road after replacing his suddenly removed spectacles. The band had dismounted and
were singing, capering, and whooping, thus expressing their satisfied delight in the life of a
jolly outlaw. Rattlesnake Rogers, who stood at the heads of the mules, jerked a little too
vigorously at the rein of the tender-mouthed Donder, who reared and emitted a loud,
protesting snort of pain. Instantly Fritz, with a scream of anger, flew at the bulky Rogers and
began to assiduously pummel that surprised freebooter with his fists.
&ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; shouted Fritz, &ldquo;dog, bigstiff! Dot mule he has a soreness by his mouth. I vill
knock off your shoulders mit your head&ndash; robbermans!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yi-yi!&rdquo; howled Rattlesnake, roaring with laughter and ducking his head, &ldquo;somebody git
this here sour-krout off&rsquo;n me!&rdquo;
One of the band yanked Fritz back by the coat-tail, and the woods rang with
Rattlesnake&rsquo;s vociferous comments.
&ldquo;The dog-goned little wienerwurst,&rdquo; he yelled, amiably. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not so much of a skunk,
for a Dutchman. Took up for his animile plum quick, didn&rsquo;t he? I like to see a man like hishoss, even if it is a mule. The dad-blamed little Limburger he went for me, didn&rsquo;t he! Whoa,
now, muley&ndash;I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to hurt your mouth agin any more.&rdquo;
Perhaps the mail would not have been tampered with had not Ben Moody, the
lieutenant, possessed certain wisdom that seemed to promise more spoils.
&ldquo;Say, Cap,&rdquo; he said, addressing Hondo Bill, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s likely to be good pickings in these
mail sacks. I&rsquo;ve done some hoss tradin&rsquo; with these Dutchmen around Fredericksburg, and I
know the style of the varmints. There&rsquo;s big money goes through the mails to that town.
Them Dutch risk a thousand dollars sent wrapped in a piece of paper before they&rsquo;d pay the
banks to handle the money.&rdquo;
Hondo Bill, six feet two, gentle of voice and impulsive in action, was dragging the sacks
from the rear of the wagon before Moody had finished his speech. A knife shone in his hand,
and they heard the ripping sound as it bit through the tough canvas. The outlaws crowded
around and began tearing open letters and packages, enlivening their labours by swearing
affably at the writers, who seemed to have conspired to confute the prediction of Ben
Moody. Not a dollar was found in the Fredericksburg mail.
&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself,&rdquo; said Hondo Bill to the mail- carrier in solemn
tones, &ldquo;to be packing around such a lot of old, trashy paper as this. What d&rsquo;you mean by it,
anyhow? Where do you Dutchers keep your money at?&rdquo;
The Ballinger mail sack opened like a cocoon under Hondo&rsquo;s knife. It contained but a
handful of mail. Fritz had been fuming with terror and excitement until this sack was
reached. He now remembered Lena&rsquo;s letter. He addressed the leader of the band, asking
that that particular missive be spared.
&ldquo;Much obliged, Dutch,&rdquo; he said to the disturbed carrier. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s the letter we
want. Got spondulicks in it, ain&rsquo;t it? Here she is. Make a light, boys.&rdquo;
Hondo found and tore open the letter to Mrs. Hildesmuller. The others stood about,
lighting twisted up letters one from another. Hondo gazed with mute disapproval at the
single sheet of paper covered with the angular German script.
&ldquo;Whatever is this you&rsquo;ve humbugged us with, Dutchy? You call this here a valuable
letter? That&rsquo;s a mighty low-down trick to play on your friends what come along to help you
distribute your mail.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Chiny writin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Sandy Grundy, peering over Hondo&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re off your kazip,&rdquo; declared another of the gang, an effective youth, covered with
silk handkerchiefs and nickel plating. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s shorthand. I see &lsquo;em do it once in court.&rdquo;&ldquo;Ach, no, no, no&ndash;dot is German,&rdquo; said Fritz. &ldquo;It is no more as a little girl writing a letter
to her mamma. One poor little girl, sick and vorking hard avay from home. Ach! it is a shame.
Good Mr. Robberman, you vill please let me have dot letter?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What the devil do you take us for, old Pretzels?&rdquo; said Hondo with sudden and
surprising severity. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t presumin&rsquo; to insinuate that we gents ain&rsquo;t possessed of
sufficient politeness for to take an interest in the miss&rsquo;s health, are you? Now, you go on,
and you read that scratchin&rsquo; out loud and in plain United States language to this here
company of educated society.&rdquo;
Hondo twirled his six-shooter by its trigger guard and stood towering above the little
German, who at once began to read the letter, translating the simple words into English. The
gang of rovers stood in absolute silence, listening intently.
&ldquo;How old is that kid?&rdquo; asked Hondo when the letter was done.
&ldquo;Eleven,&rdquo; said Fritz.
&ldquo;And where is she at?&rdquo;
&ldquo;At dose rock quarries&ndash;working. Ach, mein Gott&ndash;little Lena, she speak of drowning. I
do not know if she vill do it, but if she shall I schwear I vill dot Peter Hildesmuller shoot mit a
gun.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You Dutchers,&rdquo; said Hondo Bill, his voice swelling with fine contempt, &ldquo;make me plenty
tired. Hirin&rsquo; out your kids to work when they ought to be playin&rsquo; dolls in the sand. You&rsquo;re a
hell of a sect of people. I reckon we&rsquo;ll fix your clock for a while just to show what we think of
your old cheesy nation. Here, boys!&rdquo;
Hondo Bill parleyed aside briefly with his band, and then they seized Fritz and conveyed
him off the road to one side. Here they bound him fast to a tree with a couple of lariats. His
team they tied to another tree near by.
&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t going to hurt you bad,&rdquo; said Hondo reassuringly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twon&rsquo;t hurt you to be tied
up for a while. We will now pass you the time of day, as it is up to us to depart.
Ausgespielt&ndash;nixcumrous, Dutchy. Don&rsquo;t get any more impatience.&rdquo;
Fritz heard a great squeaking of saddles as the men mounted their horses. Then a loud
yell and a great clatter of hoofs as they galloped pell-mell back along the Fredericksburg
road.
For more than two hours Fritz sat against his tree, tightly but not painfully bound. Then
from the reaction after his exciting adventure he sank into slumber. How long he slept he
knew not, but he was at last awakened by a rough shake. Hands were untying his ropes. Hewas lifted to his feet, dazed, confused in mind, and weary of body. Rubbing his eyes, he
looked and saw that he was again in the midst of the same band of terrible bandits. They
shoved him up to the seat of his wagon and placed the lines in his hands.
&ldquo;Hit it out for home, Dutch,&rdquo; said Hondo Bill&rsquo;s voice commandingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given us
lots of trouble and we&rsquo;re pleased to see the back of your neck. Spiel! Zwei bier! Vamoose!&rdquo;
Hondo reached out and gave Blitzen a smart cut with his quirt.
The little mules sprang ahead, glad to be moving again. Fritz urged them along, himself
dizzy and muddled over his fearful adventure.
According to schedule time, he should have reached Fredericksburg at daylight. As it
was, he drove down the long street of the town at eleven o&rsquo;clock A.M. He had to pass Peter
Hildesmuller&rsquo;s house on his way to the post-office. He stopped his team at the gate and
called. But Frau Hildesmuller was watching for him. Out rushed the whole family of
Hildesmullers.
Frau Hildesmuller, fat and flushed, inquired if he had a letter from Lena, and then Fritz
raised his voice and told the tale of his adventure. He told the contents of that letter that the
robber had made him read, and then Frau Hildesmuller broke into wild weeping. Her little
Lena drown herself! Why had they sent her from home? What could be done? Perhaps it
would be too late by the time they could send for her now. Peter Hildesmuller dropped his
meerschaum on the walk and it shivered into pieces.
&ldquo;Woman!&rdquo; he roared at his wife, &ldquo;why did you let that child go away? It is your fault if
she comes home to us no more.&rdquo;
Every one knew that it was Peter Hildesmuller&rsquo;s fault, so they paid no attention to his
words.
A moment afterward a strange, faint voice was heard to call: &ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo; Frau
Hildesmuller at first thought it was Lena&rsquo;s spirit calling, and then she rushed to the rear of
Fritz&rsquo;s covered wagon, and, with a loud shriek of joy, caught up Lena herself, covering her
pale little face with kisses and smothering her with hugs. Lena&rsquo;s eyes were heavy with the
deep slumber of exhaustion, but she smiled and lay close to the one she had longed to see.
There among the mail sacks, covered in a nest of strange blankets and comforters, she had
lain asleep until wakened by the voices around her.
Fritz stared at her with eyes that bulged behind his spectacles.
&ldquo;Gott in Himmel!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;How did you get in that wagon? Am I going crazy as
well as to be murdered and hanged by robbers this day?&ldquo;&ldquo;You brought her to us, Fritz,&rdquo; cried Frau Hildesmuller. &ldquo;How can we ever thank you
enough?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tell mamma how you came in Fritz&rsquo;s wagon,&rdquo; said Frau Hildesmuller.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Lena. &ldquo;But I know how I got away from the hotel. The Prince
brought me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;By the Emperor&rsquo;s crown!&rdquo; shouted Fritz, &ldquo;we are all going crazy.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I always knew he would come,&rdquo; said Lena, sitting down on her bundle of bedclothes on
the sidewalk. &ldquo;Last night he came with his armed knights and captured the ogre&rsquo;s castle.
They broke the dishes and kicked down the doors. They pitched Mr. Maloney into a barrel of
rain water and threw flour all over Mrs. Maloney. The workmen in the hotel jumped out of
the windows and ran into the woods when the knights began firing their guns. They
wakened me up and I peeped down the stair. And then the Prince came up and wrapped me
in the bedclothes and carried me out. He was so tall and strong and fine. His face was as
rough as a scrubbing brush, and he talked soft and kind and smelled of schnapps. He took
me on his horse before him and we rode away among the knights. He held me close and I
went to sleep that way, and didn&rsquo;t wake up till I got home.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; cried Fritz Bergmann. &ldquo;Fairy tales! How did you come from the quarries to
my wagon?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Prince brought me,&rdquo; said Lena, confidently.
And to this day the good people of Fredericksburg haven&rsquo;t been able to make her give
any other explanation.
Christmas by Injunction （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Cherokee was the civic father of Yellowhammer. Yellowhammer was a new mining town
constructed mainly of canvas and undressed pine. Cherokee was a prospector. One day while
his burro was eating quartz and pine burrs Cherokee turned up with his pick a nugget,
weighing thirty ounces. He staked his claim and then, being a man of breadth and hospitality,
sent out invitations to his friends in three States to drop in and share his luck.
Not one of the invited guests sent regrets. They rolled in from the Gila country, from
Salt River, from the Pecos, from Albuquerque and Phoenix and Santa Fe, and from the camps
intervening.When a thousand citizens had arrived and taken up claims they named the town
Yellowhammer, appointed a vigilance committee, and presented Cherokee with a
watch-chain made of nuggets.
Three hours after the presentation ceremonies Cherokee&rsquo;s claim played out. He had
located a pocket instead of a vein. He abandoned it and staked others one by one. Luck had
kissed her hand to him. Never afterward did he turn up enough dust in Yellowhammer to
pay his bar bill. But his thousand invited guests were mostly prospering, and Cherokee
smiled and congratulated them.
Yellowhammer was made up of men who took off their hats to a smiling loser; so they
invited Cherokee to say what he wanted.
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Cherokee, &ldquo;oh, grubstakes will be about the thing. I reckon I&rsquo;ll prospect
along up in the Mariposas. If I strike it up there I will most certainly let you all know about
the facts. I never was any hand to hold out cards on my friends.&rdquo;
In May Cherokee packed his burro and turned its thoughtful, mouse- coloured forehead
to the north. Many citizens escorted him to the undefined limits of Yellowhammer and
bestowed upon him shouts of commendation and farewells. Five pocket flasks without an air
bubble between contents and cork were forced upon him; and he was bidden to consider
Yellowhammer in perpetual commission for his bed, bacon and eggs, and hot water for
shaving in the event that luck did not see fit to warm her hands by his campfire in the
Mariposas.
The name of the father of Yellowhammer was given him by the gold hunters in
accordance with their popular system of nomenclature. It was not necessary for a citizen to
exhibit his baptismal certificate in order to acquire a cognomen. A man&rsquo;s name was his
personal property. For convenience in calling him up to the bar and in designating him
among other blue-shirted bipeds, a temporary appellation, title, or epithet was conferred
upon him by the public. Personal peculiarities formed the source of the majority of such
informal baptisms. Many were easily dubbed geographically from the regions from which
they confessed to have hailed. Some announced themselves to be &ldquo;Thompsons,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Adamses,&rdquo; and the like, with a brazenness and loudness that cast a cloud upon their titles.
A few vaingloriously and shamelessly uncovered their proper and indisputable names. This
was held to be unduly arrogant, and did not win popularity. One man who said he was
Chesterton L. C. Belmont, and proved it by letters, was given till sundown to leave the town.
Such names as &ldquo;Shorty,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bow-legs,&rdquo; &ldquo;Texas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lazy Bill,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thirsty Rogers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Limping Riley,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Judge,&rdquo; and &ldquo;California Ed&rdquo; were in favour. Cherokee derived his title from the fact that
he claimed to have lived for a time with that tribe in the Indian Nation.
On the twentieth day of December Baldy, the mail rider, brought Yellowhammer a piece
of news.&ldquo;What do I see in Albuquerque,&rdquo; said Baldy, to the patrons of the bar, &ldquo;but Cherokee all
embellished and festooned up like the Czar of Turkey, and lavishin&rsquo; money in bulk. Him and
me seen the elephant and the owl, and we had specimens of this seidlitz powder wine; and
Cherokee he audits all the bills, C.O.D. His pockets looked like a pool table&rsquo;s after a
fifteen-ball run.
&ldquo;Cherokee must have struck pay ore,&rdquo; remarked California Ed. &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s white. I&rsquo;m
much obliged to him for his success.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Seems like Cherokee would ramble down to Yellowhammer and see his friends,&rdquo; said
another, slightly aggrieved. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the way. Prosperity is the finest cure there is for lost
forgetfulness.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You wait,&rdquo; said Baldy; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo; to that. Cherokee strikes a three- foot vein up in the
Mariposas that assays a trip to Europe to the ton, and he closes it out to a syndicate outfit
for a hundred thousand hasty dollars in cash. Then he buys himself a baby sealskin overcoat
and a red sleigh, and what do you think he takes it in his head to do next?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Chuck-a-luck,&rdquo; said Texas, whose ideas of recreation were the gamester&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Come and Kiss Me, Ma Honey,&rdquo; sang Shorty, who carried tintypes in his pocket and
wore a red necktie while working on his claim.
&ldquo;Bought a saloon?&rdquo; suggested Thirsty Rogers.
&ldquo;Cherokee took me to a room,&rdquo; continued Baldy, &ldquo;and showed me. He&rsquo;s got that room
full of drums and dolls and skates and bags of candy and jumping-jacks and toy lambs and
whistles and such infantile truck. And what do you think he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to do with them
inefficacious knick- knacks? Don&rsquo;t surmise none&ndash;Cherokee told me. He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to lead &lsquo;em up
in his red sleigh and&ndash;wait a minute, don&rsquo;t order no drinks yet&ndash; he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to drive down here
to Yellowhammer and give the kids&ndash;the kids of this here town&ndash;the biggest Christmas tree
and the biggest cryin&rsquo; doll and Little Giant Boys&rsquo; Tool Chest blowout that was ever seen west
of the Cape Hatteras.&rdquo;
Two minutes of absolute silence ticked away in the wake of Baldy&rsquo;s words. It was
broken by the House, who, happily conceiving the moment to be ripe for extending
hospitality, sent a dozen whisky glasses spinning down the bar, with the slower travelling
bottle bringing up the rear.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell him?&rdquo; asked the miner called Trinidad.
&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; answered Baldy, pensively; &ldquo;I never exactly seen my way to.&ldquo;You see, Cherokee had this Christmas mess already bought and paid for; and he was all
flattered up with self-esteem over his idea; and we had in a way flew the flume with that
fizzy wine I speak of; so I never let on.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I cannot refrain from a certain amount of surprise,&rdquo; said the Judge, as he hung his
ivory-handled cane on the bar, &ldquo;that our friend Cherokee should possess such an erroneous
conception of&ndash;ah&ndash;his, as it were, own town.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, it ain&rsquo;t the eighth wonder of the terrestrial world,&rdquo; said Baldy. &ldquo;Cherokee&rsquo;s been
gone from Yellowhammer over seven months. Lots of things could happen in that time.
How&rsquo;s he to know that there ain&rsquo;t a single kid in this town, and so far as emigration is
concerned, none expected?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Come to think of it,&rdquo; remarked California Ed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s funny some ain&rsquo;t drifted in. Town
ain&rsquo;t settled enough yet for to bring in the rubber- ring brigade, I reckon.&rdquo;
&ldquo;To top off this Christmas-tree splurge of Cherokee&rsquo;s,&rdquo; went on Baldy, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to give
an imitation of Santa Claus. He&rsquo;s got a white wig and whiskers that disfigure him up exactly
like the pictures of this William Cullen Longfellow in the books, and a red suit of fur-trimmed
outside underwear, and eight-ounce gloves, and a stand-up, lay-down croshayed red cap.
Ain&rsquo;t it a shame that a outfit like that can&rsquo;t get a chance to connect with a Annie and Willie&rsquo;s
prayer layout?&rdquo;
&ldquo;When does Cherokee allow to come over with his truck?&rdquo; inquired Trinidad.
&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo; before Christmas,&rdquo; said Baldy. &ldquo;And he wants you folks to have a room fixed
up and a tree hauled and ready. And such ladies to assist as can stop breathin&rsquo; long enough
to let it be a surprise for the kids.&rdquo;
The unblessed condition of Yellowhammer had been truly described. The voice of
childhood had never gladdened its flimsy structures; the patter of restless little feet had
never consecrated the one rugged highway between the two rows of tents and rough
buildings. Later they would come. But now Yellowhammer was but a mountain camp, and
nowhere in it were the roguish, expectant eyes, opening wide at dawn of the enchanting day;
the eager, small hands to reach for Santa&rsquo;s bewildering hoard; the elated, childish voicings of
the season&rsquo;s joy, such as the coming good things of the warm-hearted Cherokee deserved.
Of women there were five in Yellowhammer. The assayer&rsquo;s wife, the proprietress of the
Lucky Strike Hotel, and a laundress whose washtub panned out an ounce of dust a day.
These were the permanent feminines; the remaining two were the Spangler Sisters, Misses
Fanchon and Erma, of the Transcontinental Comedy Company, then playing in repertoire at
the (improvised) Empire Theatre. But of children there were none. Sometimes Miss Fanchon
enacted with spirit and address the part of robustious childhood; but between herdelineation and the visions of adolescence that the fancy offered as eligible recipients of
Cherokee&rsquo;s holiday stores there seemed to be fixed a gulf.
Christmas would come on Thursday. On Tuesday morning Trinidad, instead of going to
work, sought the Judge at the Lucky Strike Hotel.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a disgrace to Yellowhammer,&rdquo; said Trinidad, &ldquo;if it throws Cherokee down on his
Christmas tree blowout. You might say that that man made this town. For one, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to
see what can be done to give Santa Claus a square deal.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My co-operation,&rdquo; said the Judge, &ldquo;would be gladly forthcoming. I am indebted to
Cherokee for past favours. But, I do not see&ndash;I have heretofore regarded the absence of
children rather as a luxury&ndash;but in this instance&ndash;still, I do not see&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; said Trinidad, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll see old Ways and Means with the fur on. I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; to hitch up a team and rustle a load of kids for Cherokee&rsquo;s Santa Claus act, if I have to
rob an orphan asylum.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo; cried the Judge, enthusiastically.
&ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Trinidad, decidedly. &ldquo;I found it myself. I learned about that Latin
word at school.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I will accompany you,&rdquo; declared the Judge, waving his cane. &ldquo;Perhaps such eloquence
and gift of language as I possess will be of benefit in persuading our young friends to lend
themselves to our project.&rdquo;
Within an hour Yellowhammer was acquainted with the scheme of Trinidad and the
Judge, and approved it. Citizens who knew of families with offspring within a forty-mile
radius of Yellowhammer came forward and contributed their information. Trinidad made
careful notes of all such, and then hastened to secure a vehicle and team.
The first stop scheduled was at a double log-house fifteen miles out from
Yellowhammer. A man opened the door at Trinidad&rsquo;s hail, and then came down and leaned
upon the rickety gate. The doorway was filled with a close mass of youngsters, some ragged,
all full of curiosity and health.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; explained Trinidad. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re from Yellowhammer, and we come kidnappin&rsquo;
in a gentle kind of a way. One of our leading citizens is stung with the Santa Claus affliction,
and he&rsquo;s due in town to-morrow with half the folderols that&rsquo;s painted red and made in
Germany. The youngest kid we got in Yellowhammer packs a forty-five and a safety razor.
Consequently we&rsquo;re mighty shy on anybody to say &lsquo;Oh&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ah&rsquo; when we light the candles
on the Christmas tree. Now, partner, if you&rsquo;ll loan us a few kids we guarantee to return &lsquo;em
safe and sound on Christmas Day. And they&rsquo;ll come back loaded down with a good time andSwiss Family Robinsons and cornucopias and red drums and similar testimonials. What do
you say?&rdquo;
&ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; said the Judge, &ldquo;we have discovered for the first time in our
embryonic but progressive little city the inconveniences of the absence of adolescence. The
season of the year having approximately arrived during which it is a custom to bestow
frivolous but often appreciated gifts upon the young and tender&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said the parent, packing his pipe with a forefinger. &ldquo;I guess I needn&rsquo;t
detain you gentlemen. Me and the old woman have got seven kids, so to speak; and, runnin&rsquo;
my mind over the bunch, I don&rsquo;t appear to hit upon none that we could spare for you to take
over to your doin&rsquo;s. The old woman has got some popcorn candy and rag dolls hid in the
clothes chest, and we allow to give Christmas a little whirl of our own in a insignificant sort
of style. No, I couldn&rsquo;t, with any degree of avidity, seem to fall in with the idea of lettin&rsquo; none
of &lsquo;em go. Thank you kindly, gentlemen.&rdquo;
Down the slope they drove and up another foothill to the ranch-house of Wiley Wilson.
Trinidad recited his appeal and the Judge boomed out his ponderous antiphony. Mrs. Wiley
gathered her two rosy-cheeked youngsters close to her skirts and did not smile until she had
seen Wiley laugh and shake his head. Again a refusal.
Trinidad and the Judge vainly exhausted more than half their list before twilight set in
among the hills. They spent the night at a stage road hostelry, and set out again early the
next morning. The wagon had not acquired a single passenger.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s creepin&rsquo; upon my faculties,&rdquo; remarked Trinidad, &ldquo;that borrowin&rsquo; kids at Christmas is
somethin&rsquo; like tryin&rsquo; to steal butter from a man that&rsquo;s got hot pancakes a-comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is undoubtedly an indisputable fact,&rdquo; said the Judge, &ldquo;that the&ndash; ah&ndash;family ties seem
to be more coherent and assertive at that period of the year.&rdquo;
On the day before Christmas they drove thirty miles, making four fruitless halts and
appeals. Everywhere they found &ldquo;kids&rdquo; at a premium.
The sun was low when the wife of a section boss on a lonely railroad huddled her
unavailable progeny behind her and said:
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a woman that&rsquo;s just took charge of the railroad eatin&rsquo; house down at Granite
Junction. I hear she&rsquo;s got a little boy. Maybe she might let him go.&rdquo;
Trinidad pulled up his mules at Granite Junction at five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. The
train had just departed with its load of fed and appeased passengers.On the steps of the eating house they found a thin and glowering boy of ten smoking a
cigarette. The dining-room had been left in chaos by the peripatetic appetites. A youngish
woman reclined, exhausted, in a chair. Her face wore sharp lines of worry. She had once
possessed a certain style of beauty that would never wholly leave her and would never
wholly return. Trinidad set forth his mission.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d count it a mercy if you&rsquo;d take Bobby for a while,&rdquo; she said, wearily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the go
from morning till night, and I don&rsquo;t have time to &lsquo;tend to him. He&rsquo;s learning bad habits from
the men. It&rsquo;ll be the only chance he&rsquo;ll have to get any Christmas.&rdquo;
The men went outside and conferred with Bobby. Trinidad pictured the glories of the
Christmas tree and presents in lively colours.
&ldquo;And, moreover, my young friend,&rdquo; added the Judge, &ldquo;Santa Claus himself will
personally distribute the offerings that will typify the gifts conveyed by the shepherds of
Bethlehem to&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Aw, come off,&rdquo; said the boy, squinting his small eyes. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no kid. There ain&rsquo;t any
Santa Claus. It&rsquo;s your folks that buys toys and sneaks &lsquo;em in when you&rsquo;re asleep. And they
make marks in the soot in the chimney with the tongs to look like Santa&rsquo;s sleigh tracks.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That might be so,&rdquo; argued Trinidad, &ldquo;but Christmas trees ain&rsquo;t no fairy tale. This one&rsquo;s
goin&rsquo; to look like the ten-cent store in Albuquerque, all strung up in a redwood. There&rsquo;s tops
and drums and Noah&rsquo;s arks and&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, rats!&rdquo; said Bobby, wearily. &ldquo;I cut them out long ago. I&rsquo;d like to have a rifle&ndash;not a
target one&ndash;a real one, to shoot wildcats with; but I guess you won&rsquo;t have any of them on
your old tree.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say for sure,&rdquo; said Trinidad diplomatically; &ldquo;it might be. You go along with
us and see.&rdquo;
The hope thus held out, though faint, won the boy&rsquo;s hesitating consent to go. With this
solitary beneficiary for Cherokee&rsquo;s holiday bounty, the canvassers spun along the homeward
road.
In Yellowhammer the empty storeroom had been transformed into what might have
passed as the bower of an Arizona fairy. The ladies had done their work well. A tall Christmas
tree, covered to the topmost branch with candles, spangles, and toys sufficient for more
than a score of children, stood in the centre of the floor. Near sunset anxious eyes had
begun to scan the street for the returning team of the child-providers. At noon that day
Cherokee had dashed into town with his new sleigh piled high with bundles and boxes and
bales of all sizes and shapes. So intent was he upon the arrangements for his altruistic plans
that the dearth of children did not receive his notice. No one gave away the humiliatingstate of Yellowhammer, for the efforts of Trinidad and the Judge were expected to supply the
deficiency.
When the sun went down Cherokee, with many wings and arch grins on his seasoned
face, went into retirement with the bundle containing the Santa Claus raiment and a pack
containing special and undisclosed gifts.
&ldquo;When the kids are rounded up,&rdquo; he instructed the volunteer arrangement committee,
&ldquo;light up the candles on the tree and set &lsquo;em to playin&rsquo; &lsquo;Pussy Wants a Corner&rsquo; and &lsquo;King
William.&rsquo; When they get good and at it, why&ndash;old Santa&rsquo;ll slide in the door. I reckon there&rsquo;ll
be plenty of gifts to go &lsquo;round.&rdquo;
The ladies were flitting about the tree, giving it final touches that were never final. The
Spangled Sisters were there in costume as Lady Violet de Vere and Marie, the maid, in their
new drama, &ldquo;The Miner&rsquo;s Bride.&rdquo; The theatre did not open until nine, and they were
welcome assistants of the Christmas tree committee. Every minute heads would pop out the
door to look and listen for the approach of Trinidad&rsquo;s team. And now this became an anxious
function, for night had fallen and it would soon be necessary to light the candles on the tree,
and Cherokee was apt to make an irruption at any time in his Kriss Kringle garb.
At length the wagon of the child &ldquo;rustlers&rdquo; rattled down the street to the door. The
ladies, with little screams of excitement, flew to the lighting of the candles. The men of
Yellowhammer passed in and out restlessly or stood about the room in embarrassed groups.
Trinidad and the Judge, bearing the marks of protracted travel, entered, conducting
between them a single impish boy, who stared with sullen, pessimistic eyes at the gaudy
tree.
&ldquo;Where are the other children?&rdquo; asked the assayer&rsquo;s wife, the acknowledged leader of
all social functions.
&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Trinidad with a sigh, &ldquo;prospectin&rsquo; for kids at Christmas time is like huntin&rsquo;
in a limestone for silver. This parental business is one that I haven&rsquo;t no chance to
comprehend. It seems that fathers and mothers are willin&rsquo; for their offsprings to be
drownded, stole, fed on poison oak, and et by catamounts 364 days in the year; but on
Christmas Day they insists on enjoyin&rsquo; the exclusive mortification of their company. This here
young biped, ma&rsquo;am, is all that washes out of our two days&rsquo; manoeuvres.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, the sweet little boy!&rdquo; cooed Miss Erma, trailing her De Vere robes to centre of
stage.
&ldquo;Aw, shut up,&rdquo; said Bobby, with a scowl. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a kid? You ain&rsquo;t, you bet.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fresh brat!&rdquo; breathed Miss Erma, beneath her enamelled smile.&ldquo;We done the best we could,&rdquo; said Trinidad. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough on Cherokee, but it can&rsquo;t be
helped.&rdquo;
Then the door opened and Cherokee entered in the conventional dress of Saint Nick. A
white rippling beard and flowing hair covered his face almost to his dark and shining eyes.
Over his shoulder he carried a pack.
No one stirred as he came in. Even the Spangler Sisters ceased their coquettish poses
and stared curiously at the tall figure. Bobby stood with his hands in his pockets gazing
gloomily at the effeminate and childish tree. Cherokee put down his pack and looked
wonderingly about the room. Perhaps he fancied that a bevy of eager children were being
herded somewhere, to be loosed upon his entrance. He went up to Bobby and extended his
red-mittened hand.
&ldquo;Merry Christmas, little boy,&rdquo; said Cherokee. &ldquo;Anything on the tree you want they&rsquo;ll get
it down for you. Won&rsquo;t you shake hands with Santa Claus?&rdquo;
&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t any Santa Claus,&rdquo; whined the boy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got old false billy goat&rsquo;s whiskers
on your face. I ain&rsquo;t no kid. What do I want with dolls and tin horses? The driver said you&rsquo;d
have a rifle, and you haven&rsquo;t. I want to go home.&rdquo;
Trinidad stepped into the breach. He shook Cherokee&rsquo;s hand in warm greeting.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Cherokee,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;There never was a kid in Yellowhammer. We tried
to rustle a bunch of &lsquo;em for your swaree, but this sardine was all we could catch. He&rsquo;s a
atheist, and he don&rsquo;t believe in Santa Claus. It&rsquo;s a shame for you to be out all this truck. But
me and the Judge was sure we could round up a wagonful of candidates for your gimcracks.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Cherokee gravely. &ldquo;The expense don&rsquo;t amount to nothin&rsquo; worth
mentionin&rsquo;. We can dump the stuff down a shaft or throw it away. I don&rsquo;t know what I was
thinkin&rsquo; about; but it never occurred to my cogitations that there wasn&rsquo;t any kids in
Yellowhammer.&rdquo;
Meanwhile the company had relaxed into a hollow but praiseworthy imitation of a
pleasure gathering.
Bobby had retreated to a distant chair, and was coldly regarding the scene with ennui
plastered thick upon him. Cherokee, lingering with his original idea, went over and sat
beside him.
&ldquo;Where do you live, little boy?&rdquo; he asked respectfully.
&ldquo;Granite Junction,&rdquo; said Bobby without emphasis.The room was warm. Cherokee took off his cap, and then removed his beard and wig.
&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; exclaimed Bobby, with a show of interest, &ldquo;I know your mug, all right.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Did you ever see me before?&rdquo; asked Cherokee.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but I&rsquo;ve seen your picture lots of times.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
The boy hesitated. &ldquo;On the bureau at home,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have your name, if you please, buddy.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Robert Lumsden. The picture belongs to my mother. She puts it under her pillow of
nights. And once I saw her kiss it. I wouldn&rsquo;t. But women are that way.&rdquo;
Cherokee rose and beckoned to Trinidad.
&ldquo;Keep this boy by you till I come back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to shed these Christmas duds,
and hitch up my sleigh. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to take this kid home.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, infidel,&rdquo; said Trinidad, taking Cherokee&rsquo;s vacant chair, &ldquo;and so you are too
superannuated and effete to yearn for such mockeries as candy and toys, it seems.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like you,&rdquo; said Bobby, with acrimony. &ldquo;You said there would be a rifle. A fellow
can&rsquo;t even smoke. I wish I was at home.&rdquo;
Cherokee drove his sleigh to the door, and they lifted Bobby in beside him. The team of
fine horses sprang away prancingly over the hard snow. Cherokee had on his $500 overcoat
of baby sealskin. The laprobe that he drew about them was as warm as velvet.
Bobby slipped a cigarette from his pocket and was trying to snap a match.
&ldquo;Throw that cigarette away,&rdquo; said Cherokee, in a quiet but new voice.
Bobby hesitated, and then dropped the cylinder overboard.
&ldquo;Throw the box, too,&rdquo; commanded the new voice.
More reluctantly the boy obeyed.&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Bobby, presently, &ldquo;I like you. I don&rsquo;t know why. Nobody never made me do
anything I didn&rsquo;t want to do before.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tell me, kid,&rdquo; said Cherokee, not using his new voice, &ldquo;are you sure your mother kissed
that picture that looks like me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dead sure. I seen her do it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you remark somethin&rsquo; a while ago about wanting a rifle?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You bet I did. Will you get me one?&rdquo;
&ldquo;To-morrow&ndash;silver-mounted.&rdquo;
Cherokee took out his watch.
&ldquo;Half-past nine. We&rsquo;ll hit the Junction plumb on time with Christmas Day. Are you cold?
Sit closer, son.&rdquo;
The Coming-Out of Maggie （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Every Saturday night the Clover Leaf Social Club gave a hop in the hall of the Give and
Take Athletic Association on the East Side. In order to attend one of these dances you must
be a member of the Give and Take&ndash;or, if you belong to the division that starts off with the
right foot in waltzing, you must work in Rhinegold&rsquo;s paper-box factory. Still, any Clover Leaf
was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance. But mostly each
Give and Take brought the paper-box girl that he affected; and few strangers could boast of
having shaken a foot at the regular hops.
Maggie Toole, on account of her dull eyes, broad mouth and left- handed style of
footwork in the twostep, went to the dances with Anna McCarty and her &ldquo;fellow.&rdquo; Anna and
Maggie worked side by side in the factory, and were the greatest chums ever. So Anna
always made Jimmy Burns take her by Maggie&rsquo;s house every Saturday night so that her
friend could go to the dance with them.
The Give and Take Athletic Association lived up to its name. The hall of the association
in Orchard street was fitted out with muscle- making inventions. With the fibres thus
builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic
organisations in joyous combat. Between these more serious occupations the Saturday night
hop with the paper-box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen.For sometimes the tip went &lsquo;round, and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the
dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter- weight affair to a
finish as ever happened inside the ropes.
On Saturdays Rhinegold&rsquo;s paper-box factory closed at 3 P. M. On one such afternoon
Anna and Maggie walked homeward together. At Maggie&rsquo;s door Anna said, as usual: &ldquo;Be
ready at seven, sharp, Mag; and Jimmy and me&rsquo;ll come by for you.&rdquo;
But what was this? Instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the
non-escorted one there was to be perceived a high- poised head, a prideful dimpling at the
corners of a broad mouth, and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye.
&ldquo;Thanks, Anna,&rdquo; said Maggie; &ldquo;but you and Jimmy needn&rsquo;t bother to- night. I&rsquo;ve a
gentleman friend that&rsquo;s coming &lsquo;round to escort me to the hop.&rdquo;
The comely Anna pounced upon her friend, shook her, chided and beseeched her.
Maggie Toole catch a fellow! Plain, dear, loyal, unattractive Maggie, so sweet as a chum, so
unsought for a two-step or a moonlit bench in the little park. How was it? When did it
happen? Who was it?
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see to-night,&rdquo; said Maggie, flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had
gathered in Cupid&rsquo;s vineyard. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s swell all right. He&rsquo;s two inches taller than Jimmy, and an
up-to-date dresser. I&rsquo;ll introduce him, Anna, just as soon as we get to the hall.&rdquo;
Anna and Jimmy were among the first Clover Leafs to arrive that evening. Anna&rsquo;s eyes
were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friend&rsquo;s &ldquo;catch.&rdquo;
At 8:30 Miss Toole swept into the hall with her escort. Quickly her triumphant eye
discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful Jimmy.
&ldquo;Oh, gee!&rdquo; cried Anna, &ldquo;Mag ain&rsquo;t made a hit&ndash;oh, no! Swell fellow? well, I guess! Style?
Look at &lsquo;um.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Go as far as you like,&rdquo; said Jimmy, with sandpaper in his voice. &ldquo;Cop him out if you
want him. These new guys always win out with the push. Don&rsquo;t mind me. He don&rsquo;t squeeze
all the limes, I guess. Huh!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shut up, Jimmy. You know what I mean. I&rsquo;m glad for Mag. First fellow she ever had. Oh,
here they come.&rdquo;
Across the floor Maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser. And
truly, her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum. He stood two inches
taller than the average Give and Take athlete; his dark hair curled; his eyes and his teeth
flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles. The young men of the Clover Leaf Clubpinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess, its
achievements in hand-to-hand conflicts, and its preservation from the legal duress that
constantly menaced it. The member of the association who would bind a paperbox maiden
to his conquering chariot scorned to employ Beau Brumme1 airs. They were not considered
honourable methods of warfare. The swelling biceps, the coat straining at its buttons over
the chest, the air of conscious conviction of the supereminence of the male in the
cosmogony of creation, even a calm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents
in the gentle tourneys of Cupid&ndash;these were the approved arms and ammunition of the
Clover Leaf gallants. They viewed, then, genuflexions and alluring poses of this visitor with
their chins at a new angle.
&ldquo;A friend of mine, Mr. Terry O&rsquo;Sullivan,&rdquo; was Maggie&rsquo;s formula of introduction. She led
him around the room, presenting him to each new-arriving Clover Leaf. Almost was she
pretty now, with the unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor
and a kitten with its first mouse.
&ldquo;Maggie Toole&rsquo;s got a fellow at last,&rdquo; was the word that went round among the
paper-box girls. &ldquo;Pipe Mag&rsquo;s floor-walker&rdquo;&ndash;thus the Give and Takes expressed their
indifferent contempt.
Usually at the weekly hops Maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back. She felt
and showed so much gratitude whenever a self- sacrificing partner invited her to dance that
his pleasure was cheapened and diminished. She had even grown used to noticing Anna
joggle the reluctant Jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over
his feet through a two-step.
But to-night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six. Terry O&rsquo;Sullivan was a
victorious Prince Charming, and Maggie Toole winged her first butterfly flight. And though
our tropes of fairyland be mixed with those of entomology they shall not spill one drop of
ambrosia from the rose-crowned melody of Maggie&rsquo;s one perfect night.
The girls besieged her for introductions to her &ldquo;fellow.&rdquo; The Clover Leaf young men,
after two years of blindness, suddenly perceived charms in Miss Toole. They flexed their
compelling muscles before her and bespoke her for the dance.
Thus she scored; but to Terry O&rsquo;Sullivan the honours of the evening fell thick and fast.
He shook his curls; he smiled and went easily through the seven motions for acquiring grace
in your own room before an open window ten minutes each day. He danced like a faun; he
introduced manner and style and atmosphere; his words came trippingly upon his tongue,
and&ndash;he waltzed twice in succession with the paper- box girl that Dempsey Donovan
brought.
Dempsey was the leader of the association. He wore a dress suit, and could chin the bar
twice with one hand. He was one of &ldquo;Big Mike&rdquo; O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s lieutenants, and was nevertroubled by trouble. No cop dared to arrest him. Whenever be broke a pushcart man&rsquo;s head
or shot a member of the Heinrick B. Sweeney Outing and Literary Association in the kneecap,
an officer would drop around and say:
&ldquo;The Cap&rsquo;n &rsquo;d like to see ye a few minutes round to the office whin ye have time,
Dempsey, me boy.&rdquo;
But there would be sundry gentlemen there with large gold fob chains and black cigars;
and somebody would tell a funny story, and then Dempsey would go back and work half an
hour with the sixpound dumbbells. So, doing a tight-rope act on a wire stretched across
Niagara was a safe terpsichorean performance compared with waltzing twice with Dempsey
Donovan&rsquo;s paper-box girl. At 10 o&rsquo;clock the jolly round face of &ldquo;Big Mike&rdquo; O&rsquo;Sullivan shone at
the door for five minutes upon the scene. He always looked in for five minutes, smiled at the
girls and handed out real perfectos to the delighted boys.
Dempsey Donovan was at his elbow instantly, talking rapidly. &ldquo;Big Mike&rdquo; looked
carefully at the dancers, smiled, shook his head and departed.
The music stopped. The dancers scattered to the chairs along the walls. Terry O&rsquo;Sullivan,
with his entrancing bow, relinquished a pretty girl in blue to her partner and started back to
find Maggie. Dempsey intercepted him in the middle of the floor.
Some fine instinct that Rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly every one to
turn and look at them&ndash;there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena.
Two or three Give and Takes with tight coat sleeves drew nearer.
&ldquo;One moment, Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan,&rdquo; said Dempsey. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re enjoying yourself. Where
did you say you live?&rdquo;
The two gladiators were well matched. Dempsey had, perhaps, ten pounds of weight to
give away. The O&rsquo;Sullivan had breadth with quickness. Dempsey had a glacial eye, a
dominating slit of a mouth, an indestructible jaw, a complexion like a belle&rsquo;s and the
coolness of a champion. The visitor showed more fire in his contempt and less control over
his conspicuous sneer. They were enemies by the law written when the rocks were molten.
They were each too splendid, too mighty, too incomparable to divide pre-eminence. One
only must survive.
&ldquo;I live on Grand,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Sullivan, insolently; &ldquo;and no trouble to find me at home. Where
do you live?&rdquo;
Dempsey ignored the question.
&ldquo;You say your name&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Sullivan,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Well, &lsquo;Big Mike&rsquo; says he never saw you
before.&ldquo;&ldquo;Lots of things he never saw,&rdquo; said the favourite of the hop.
&ldquo;As a rule,&rdquo; went on Dempsey, huskily sweet, &ldquo;O&rsquo;Sullivans in this district know one
another. You escorted one of our lady members here, and we want chance to make good. If
you&rsquo;ve got a family tree let&rsquo;s see a few historical O&rsquo;Sullivan buds come out on it. Or do you
want us to dig it out of you by the roots?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Suppose you mind your own business,&rdquo; suggested O&rsquo;Sullivan, blandly.
Dempsey&rsquo;s eye brightened. He held up an inspired forefinger as though a brilliant idea
had struck him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it now,&rdquo; he said cordially. &ldquo;It was just a little mistake. You ain&rsquo;t no O&rsquo;Sullivan.
You are a ring-tailed monkey. Excuse us for not recognising you at first.&rdquo;
O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s eye flashed. He made a quick movement, but Andy Geoghan was ready and
caught his arm.
Dempsey nodded at Andy and William McMahan, the secretary of the club, and walked
rapidly toward a door at the rear of the hall. Two other members of the Give and Take
Association swiftly joined the little group. Terry O&rsquo;Sullivan was now in the hands of the
Board of Rules and Social Referees. They spoke to him briefly and softly, and conducted him
out through the same door at the rear.
This movement on the part of the Clover Leaf members requires a word of elucidation.
Back of the association hall was a smaller room rented by the club. In this room personal
difficulties that arose on the ballroom floor were settled, man to man, with the weapons of
nature, under the supervision of the board. No lady could say that she had witnessed a fight
at a Clover Leaf hop in several years. Its gentlemen members guaranteed that.
So easily and smoothly had Dempsey and the board done their preliminary work that
many in the hall had not noticed the checking of the fascinating O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s social triumph.
Among these was Maggie. She looked about for her escort.
&ldquo;Smoke up!&rdquo; said Rose Cassidy. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t you on? Demps Donovan picked a scrap with
your Lizzie-boy, and they&rsquo;ve waltzed out to the slaughter room with him. How&rsquo;s my hair look
done up this way, Mag?&rdquo;
Maggie laid a hand on the bosom of her cheesecloth waist.
&ldquo;Gone to fight with Dempsey!&rdquo; she said, breathlessly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got to be stopped.
Dempsey Donovan can&rsquo;t fight him. Why, he&rsquo;ll&ndash;he&rsquo;ll kill him!&ldquo;&ldquo;Ah, what do you care?&rdquo; said Rosa. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t some of &lsquo;em fight every hop?&rdquo;
But Maggie was off, darting her zig-zag way through the maze of dancers. She burst
through the rear door into the dark hall and then threw her solid shoulder against the door
of the room of single combat. It gave way, and in the instant that she entered her eye caught
the scene&ndash;the Board standing about with open watches; Dempsey Donovan in his shirt
sleeves dancing, light-footed, with the wary grace of the modern pugilist, within easy reach
of his adversary; Terry O&rsquo;Sullivan standing with arms folded and a murderous look in his dark
eyes. And without slacking the speed of her entrance she leaped forward with a
scream&ndash;leaped in time to catch and hang upon the arm of O&rsquo;Sullivan that was suddenly
uplifted, and to whisk from it the long, bright stiletto that he had drawn from his bosom.
The knife fell and rang upon the floor. Cold steel drawn in the rooms of the Give and
Take Association! Such a thing had never happened before. Every one stood motionless for a
minute. Andy Geoghan kicked the stiletto with the toe of his shoe curiously, like an
antiquarian who has come upon some ancient weapon unknown to his learning.
And then O&rsquo;Sullivan hissed something unintelligible between his teeth. Dempsey and
the board exchanged looks. And then Dempsey looked at O&rsquo;Sullivan without anger, as one
looks at a stray dog, and nodded his head in the direction of the door.
&ldquo;The back stairs, Giuseppi,&rdquo; he said, briefly. &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;11 pitch your hat down after
you.&rdquo;
Maggie walked up to Dempsey Donovan. There was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks,
down which slow tears were running. But she looked him bravely in the eye.
&ldquo;I knew it, Dempsey,&rdquo; she said, as her eyes grew dull even in their tears. &ldquo;I knew he was
a Guinea. His name&rsquo;s Tony Spinelli. I hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin&rsquo;.
Them Guineas always carries knives. But you don&rsquo;t understand, Dempsey. I never had a
fellow in my life. I got tired of comin&rsquo; with Anna and Jimmy every night, so I fixed it with him
to call himself O&rsquo;Sullivan, and brought him along. I knew there&rsquo;d be nothin&rsquo; doin&rsquo; for him if
he came as a Dago. I guess I&rsquo;ll resign from the club now.&rdquo;
Dempsey turned to Andy Geoghan.
&ldquo;Chuck that cheese slicer out of the window,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and tell &lsquo;em inside that Mr.
O&rsquo;Sullivan has had a telephone message to go down to Tammany Hall.&rdquo;
And then he turned back to Maggie.
&ldquo;Say, Mag,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you home. And how about next Saturday night? Will you
come to the hop with me if I call around for you?&ldquo;It was remarkable how quickly Maggie&rsquo;s eyes could change from dull to a shining
brown.
&ldquo;With you, Dempsey?&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;Say&ndash;will a duck swim?&rdquo;
Compliments Of The Season （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>There are no more Christmas stories to write. Fiction is exhausted; and newspaper
items, the next best, are manufactured by clever young journalists who have married early
and have an engagingly pessimistic view of life. Therefore, for seasonable diversion, we are
reduced to very questionable sources - facts and philosophy. We will begin with - whichever
you choose to call it.
Children are pestilential little animals with which we have to cope under a bewildering
variety of conditions. Especially when childish sorrows overwhelm them are we put to our
wits&rsquo; end. We exhaust our paltry store of consolation; and then beat them, sobbing, to sleep.
Then we grovel in the dust of a million years, and ask God why. Thus we call out of the
rat-trap. As for the children, no one understands them except old maids, hunchbacks, and
shepherd dogs.
Now comes the facts in the case of the Rag-Doll, the Tatterdemalion, and the
Twenty-fifth of December.
On the tenth of that month the Child of the Millionaire lost her rag-doll. There were
many servants in the Millionaire&rsquo;s palace on the Hudson, and these ransacked the house and
grounds, but without finding the lost treasure. The child was a girl of five, and one of those
perverse little beasts that often wound the sensibilities of wealthy parents by fixing their
affections upon some vulgar, inexpensive toy instead of upon diamond-studded automobiles
and pony phaetons.
The Child grieved sorely and truly, a thing inexplicable to the Millionaire, to whom the
rag-doll market was about as interesting as Bay State Gas; and to the Lady, the Child&rsquo;s
mother, who was all form - that is, nearly all, as you shall see.
The Child cried inconsolably, and grew hollow-eyed, knock-kneed, spindling, and
corykilverty in many other respects. The Millionaire smiled and tapped his coffers
confidently. The pick of the output of the French and German toymakers was rushed by
special delivery to the mansion; but Rachel refused to be comforted. She was weeping for
her rag child, and was for a high protective tariff against all foreign foolishness. Then doctors
with the finest bedside manners and stop-watches were called in. One by one they chatteredfutilely about peptomanganate of iron and sea voyages and hypophosphites until their
stop-watches showed that Bill Rendered was under the wire for show or place. Then, as men,
they advised that the rag-doll be found as soon as possible and restored to its mourning
parent. The Child sniffed at therapeutics, chewed a thumb, and wailed for her Betsy. And all
this time cablegrams were coming from Santa Claus saying that he would soon be here and
enjoining us to show a true Christian spirit and let up on the pool-rooms and tontine policies
and platoon systems long enough to give him a welcome. Everywhere the spirit of Christmas
was diffusing itself. The banks were refusing loans, the pawn-brokers had doubled their gang
of helpers, people bumped your shins on the streets with red sleds, Thomas and Jeremiah
bubbled before you on the bars while you waited on one foot, holly-wreaths of hospitality
were hung in windows of the stores, they who had &lsquo;em were getting their furs. You hardly
knew which was the best bet in balls - three, high, moth, or snow. It was no time at which to
lose the rag-doll or your heart.
If Doctor Watson&rsquo;s investigating friend had been called in to solve this mysterious
disappearance he might have observed on the Millionaire&rsquo;s wall a copy of &ldquo;The Vampire.&rdquo;
That would have quickly suggested, by induction, &ldquo;A rag and a bone and a hank of hair.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Flip,&rdquo; a Scotch terrier, next to the rag-doll in the Child&rsquo;s heart, frisked through the halls. The
hank of hair! Aha! X, the unfound quantity, represented the rag-doll. But, the bone? Well,
when dogs find bones they - Done! It were an easy and a fruitful task to examine Flip&rsquo;s
forefeet. Look, Watson! Earth - dried earth between the toes. Of course, the dog - but
Sherlock was not there. Therefore it devolves. But topography and architecture must
intervene.
The Millionaire&rsquo;s palace occupied a lordly space. In front of it was a lawn close-mowed
as a South Ireland man&rsquo;s face two days after a shave. At one side of it, and fronting on
another street was a pleasuance trimmed to a leaf, and the garage and stables. The Scotch
pup had ravished the rag-doll from the nursery, dragged it to a corner of the lawn, dug a
hole, and buried it after the manner of careless undertakers. There you have the mystery
solved, and no checks to write for the hypodermical wizard of fi&rsquo;-pun notes to toss to the
sergeant. Then let&rsquo;s get down to the heart of the thing, tiresome readers - the Christmas
heart of the thing.
Fuzzy was drunk - not riotously or helplessly or loquaciously, as you or I might get, but
decently, appropriately, and inoffensively, as becomes a gentleman down on his luck.
Fuzzy was a soldier of misfortune. The road, the haystack, the park bench, the kitchen
door, the bitter round of eleemosynary beds-with-shower-bath-attachment, the petty
pickings and ignobly garnered largesse of great cities - these formed the chapters of his
history.
Fuzzy walked toward the river, down the street that bounded one side of the
Millionaire&rsquo;s house and grounds. He saw a leg of Betsy, the lost rag-doll, protruding, like the
clue to a Lilliputian murder mystery, from its untimely grave in a corner of the fence. Hedragged forth the maltreated infant, tucked it under his arm, and went on his way crooning a
road song of his brethrren that no doll that has been brought up to the sheltered life should
hear. Well for Betsy that she had no ears. And well that she had no eyes save unseeing circles
of black; for the faces of Fuzzy and the Scotch terrier were those of brothers, and the heart
of no rag-doll could withstand twice to become the prey of such fearsome monsters.
Though you may not know it, Grogan&rsquo;s saloon stands near the river and near the foot of
the street down which Fuzzy traveled. In Grogan&rsquo;s, Christmas cheer was already rampant.
Fuzzy entered with his doll. He fancied that as a mummer at the feast of Saturn he
might earn a few drops from the wassail cup.
He set Betsy on the bar and addressed her loudly and humorously, seasoning his
speech with exaggerated compliments and endearments, as one entertaining his lady friend.
The loafers and bibbers around caught the farce of it, and roared. The bartender gave Fuzzy
a drink. Oh, many of us carry rag-dolls.
&ldquo;One for the lady?&rdquo; suggested Fuzzy impudently, and tucked another contribution to
Art beneath his waistcoat.
He began to see possibilities in Betsy. His first-night had been a success. Visions of a
vaudeville circuit about town dawned upon him.
In a group near the stove sat &ldquo;Pigeon&rdquo; McCarthy, Black Riley, and &ldquo;One-ear&rdquo; Mike, well
and unfavorably known in the tough shoestring district that blackened the left bank of the
river. They passed a newspaper back and forth among themselves. The item that each solid
and blunt forefinger pointed out was an advertisement headed &ldquo;One Hundred Dollars
Reward.&rdquo; To earn it one must return the rag-doll lost, strayed, or stolen from the
Millionaire&rsquo;s mansion. It seemed that grief still ravaged, unchecked, in the bosom of the too
faithful Child. Flip, the terrier, capered and shook his absurd whisker before her, powerless
to distract. She wailed for her Betsy in the faces of walking, talking, mama-ing, and
eye-closing French Mabelles and Violettes. The advertisement was a last resort.
Black Riley came from behind the stove and approached Fuzzy in his one-sided
parabolic way.
The Christmas mummer, flushed with success, had tucked Betsy under his arm, and was
about to depart to the filling of impromptu dates elsewhere.
&ldquo;Say, &lsquo;Bo,&rdquo; said Black Riley to him, &ldquo;where did you cop out dat doll?&rdquo;
&ldquo;This doll?&rdquo; asked Fuzzy, touching Betsy with his forefinger to be sure that she was the
one referred to. his doll was presented to me by the Emperor of Beloochistan. I have seven
hundred others in my country home in Newport. This doll -&ldquo;&ldquo;Cheese the funny business,&rdquo; said Riley. &ldquo;You swiped it or picked it up at de house on de
hill where - but never mind dat. You want to take fifty cents for de rags, and take it quick. Me
brother&rsquo;s kid at home might be wantin&rsquo; to play wid it. Hey - what?&rdquo;
He produced the coin.
Fuzzy laughed a gurgling, insolent, alcoholic laugh in his face. Go to the office of Sarah
Bernhardt&rsquo;s manager and propose to him that she be released from a night&rsquo;s performance to
entertain the Tackytown Lyceum and Literary Coterie. You will hear the duplicate of Fuzzy&rsquo;s
laugh.
Black Riley gauged Fuzzy quickly with his blueberry eye as a wrestler does. His hand was
itching to play the Roman and wrest the rag Sabine from the extemporaneous merry-andrew
who was entertaining an angel unaware. But he refrained. Fuzzy was fat and solid and big.
Three inches of well-nourished corporeity, defended from the winter winds by dingy linen,
intervened between his vest and trousers. Countless small, circular wrinkles running around
his coat-sleeves and knees guaranteed the quality of his bone and muscle. His small, blue
eyes, bathed in the moisture of altruism and wooziness, looked upon you kindly, yet without
abashment. He was whiskerly, whiskyly, fleshily formidable. So, Black Riley temporized.
&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;ll you take for it, den?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Money,&rdquo; said Fuzzy, with husky firmness, &ldquo;cannot buy her.&rdquo;
He was intoxicated with the artist&rsquo;s first sweet cup of attainment. To set a faded-blue,
earth-stained rag-doll on a bar, to hold mimic converse with it, and to find his heart leaping
with the sense of plaudits earned and his throat scorching with free libations poured in his
honor - could base coin buy him from such achievements? You will perceive that Fuzzy had
the temperament.
Fuzzy walked out with the gait of a trained sea-lion in search of other caf&rsquo;es to conquer.
Though the dusk of twilight was hardly yet apparent, lights were beginning to spangle
the city like pop-corn bursting in a deep skillet. Christmas Eve, impatiently expected, was
peeping over the brink of the hour. Millions had prepared for its celebration. Towns would
be painted red. You, yourself, have heard the horns and dodged the capers of the
Saturnalians.
&ldquo;Pigeon&rdquo; McCarthy, Black Riley, and &ldquo;One-ear&rdquo; Mike held a hasty converse outside
Grogan&rsquo;s. They were narrow-chested, pallid striplings, not fighters in the open, but more
dangerous in their ways of warfare than the most terrible of Turks. Fuzzy, in a pitched battle,
could have eaten the three of them. In a go-as-you-please encounter he was already
doomed.They overtook him just as he and Betsy were entering Costigan&rsquo;s Casino. They deflected
him, and shoved the newspaper under his nose. Fuzzy could read - and more.
&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are certainly damn true friends. Give me a week to think it over.&rdquo;
The soul of a real artist is quenched with difficulty.
The boys carefully pointed out to him that advertisements were soulless, and that the
deficiencies of the day might not be supplied by the morrow.
&ldquo;A cool hundred,&rdquo; said Fuzzy thoughtfully and mushily.
&ldquo;Booys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are true friends. I&rsquo;ll go up and claim the reward. The show
business is not what it used to be.&rdquo;
Night was falling more surely. The three tagged at his sides to the foot of the rise on
which stood the Millionaire&rsquo;s house. There Fuzzy turned upon them acrimoniously.
&ldquo;You are a pack of putty-faced beagle-hounds,&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Go away.&rdquo;
They went away - a little way.
In &ldquo;Pigeon&rdquo; McCarthy&rsquo;s pocket was a section of one-inch gas-pipe eight inches long. In
one end of it and in the middle of it was a lead plug. One-half of it was packed tight with
solder. Black Riley carried a slung-shot, being a conventional thug. &ldquo;One-ear&rdquo; Mike relied
upon a pair of brass knucks - an heirloom in the family.
&ldquo;Why fetch and carry,&rdquo; said Black Riley, &ldquo;when some one will do it for ye? Let him bring
it out to us. Hey - what?&rdquo;
&ldquo;We can chuck him in the river,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Pigeon&rdquo; McCarthy, &ldquo;with a stone tied to his feet.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Youse guys make me tired,&rdquo; said &ldquo;One-ear&rdquo; Mike sadly. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t progress ever appealed
to none of yez? Sprinkle a little gasoline on &lsquo;im, and drop &lsquo;im on the Drive - well?&rdquo;
Fuzzy entered the Millionaire&rsquo;s gate and zigzagged toward the softly glowing entrance
of the mansion. The three goblins came up to the gate and lingered - one on each side of it,
one beyond the roadway. They fingered their cold metal and leather, confident.
Fuzzy rang the door-bell, smiling foolishly and dreamily. An atavistic instrinct prompted
him to reach for the button of his right glove. But he wore no gloves; so his left hand
dropped, embarrassed.The particular menial whose duty it was to open doors to silks and laces shied at first
sight of Fuzzy. But a second glance took in his passport, his card of admission, his surety of
welcome - the lost rag-doll of the daughter of the house dangling under his arm.
Fuzzy was admitted into a great hall, dim with the glow from unseen lights. The hireling
went away and returned with a maid and the Child. The doll was restored to the mourning
one. She clasped her lost darling to her breast; and then, with the inordinate selfishness and
candor of childhood, stamped her foot and whined hatred and fear of the odious being who
had rescued her from the depths of sorrow and despair. Fuzzy wriggled himself into an
ingratiatory attitude and essayed the idiotic smile and blattering small talk that is supposed
to charm the budding intellect of the young. The Child bawled, and was dragged away,
hugging her Betsy close.
There came the Secretary, pale, poised, polished, gliding in pumps, and worshipping
pomp and ceremony. He counted out into Fuzzy&rsquo;s hand ten ten-dollar bills; then dropped his
eye upon the door, transferred it to James, its custodian, indicated the obnoxious earner of
the reward with the other, and allowed his pumps to waft him away to secretarial regions.
James gathered Fuzzy with his own commanding optic and swept him as far as the front
door.
When the money touched fuzzy&rsquo;s dingy palm his first instinct was to take to his heels;
but a second thought restrained him from that blunder of etiquette. It was his; it had been
given him. It - and, oh, what an elysium it opened to the gaze of his mind&rsquo;s eye! He had
tumbled to the foot of the ladder; he was hungry, homeless, friendless, ragged, cold, drifting;
and he held in his hand the key to a paradise of the mud-honey that he craved. The fairy doll
had waved a wand with her rag-stuffed hand; and now wherever he might go the enchanted
palaces with shining foot-rests and magic red fluids in gleaming glassware would be open to
him.
He followed James to the door.
He paused there as the flunky drew open the great mahogany portal for him to pass
into the vestibule.
Beyond the wrought-iron gates in the dark highway Black Riley and his two pals casually
strolled, fingering under their coats the inevitably fatal weapons that were to make the
reward of the rag-doll theirs.
Fuzzy stopped at the Millionaire&rsquo;s door and bethought himself. Like little sprigs of
mistletoe on a dead tree, certain living green thoughts and memories began to decorate his
confused mind. He was quite drunk, mind you, and the present was beginning to fade. Those
wreaths aand festoons of holly with their scarlet berries making the great hall gay - where
had he seen such things before? Somewhere he had known polished floors and odors offresh flowers in winter, and - and some one was singing a song in the house that he thought
he had heard before. Some one singing and playing a harp. Of course, it was Christmas -
Fuzzy though he must have been pretty drunk to have overlooked that.
And then he went out of the present, and there came back to him out of some
impossible, vanished, and irrevocable past a little, pure-white, transient, forgotten ghost -
the spirit of nobless oblige. Upon a gentleman certain things devolve.
James opened the outer door. A stream of light went down the graveled walk to the
iron gate. Black Riley, McCarthy, and &ldquo;One-ear&rdquo; Mike saw, and carelessly drew their sinister
cordon closer about the gate.
With a more imperious gesture than James&rsquo;s master had ever used or could ever use,
Fuzzy compelled the menial to close the door. Upon a gentleman certain things devolve.
Especially at the Christmas season.
&ldquo;It is cust - customary,&rdquo; he said to James, the flustered, &ldquo;when a gentleman calls on
Christmas Eve to pass the compliments of the season with the lady of the house. You
und&rsquo;stand? I shall not move shtep till I pass compl&rsquo;ments season with lady the house.
Und&rsquo;stand?&rdquo;
There was an argument. James lost. Fuzzy raised his voice and sent it through the house
unpleasantly. I did not say he was a gentleman. He was simply a tramp being visited by a
ghost.
A sterling silver bell rang. James went back to answer it, leaving Fuzzy in the hall. James
explained somewhere to some one.
Then he came and conducted Fuzzy into the library.
The lady entered a moment later. She was more beautiful and holy than any picture
that Fuzzy had seen. She smiled, and said something about a doll. Fuzzy didn&rsquo;t understand
that; he remembered nothing about a doll.
A footman brought in two small glasses of sparkling wine on a stamped sterling-silver
waiter. The Lady took one. The other was handed to Fuzzy.
As his fingers closed on the slender glass stem his disabilities dropped from him for one
brief moment. He straightened himself; and Time, so disobliging to most of us, turned
backward to accomodate Fuzzy.
Forgotten Christmas ghosts whiter than the false beards of the most opulent Kris
Kringle were rising in the fumes of Grogan&rsquo;s whisky. What had the Millionaire&rsquo;s mansion to
do with a long, wainscoted Virginia hall, where the riders were grouped around a silverpunch-bowl, drinking the ancient toast of the House? And why should the patter of the cab
horses&rsquo; hoofs on the frozen street be in any wise related to the sound of the saddled hunters
stamping under the shelter of the west veranda? And what had Fuzzy to do with any of it?
The Lady, looking at him over her glass, let her condescending smile fade away like a
false dawn. Her eyes turned serious. She saw something beneath the rags and Scotch terrier
whiskers that she did not understand. But it did not matter.
Fuzzy lifted his glass and smiled vacantly.
&ldquo;P-pardon, lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but couldn&rsquo;t leave without exchangin&rsquo; comp&rsquo;ments sheason
with lady th&rsquo; house. &lsquo;Gainst princ&rsquo;ples gen&rsquo;leman do sho.&rdquo;
And then he began the ancient salutation that was a tradition in the House when men
wore lace ruffles and powder.
&ldquo;The blessings of another year -&rdquo;
Fuzzy&rsquo;s memory failed him. The Lady prompted:
&ldquo;- Be upon this hearth.&rdquo;
&ldquo;- The guest -&rdquo; stammered Fuzzy.
&ldquo;- And upon her who -&rdquo; continued the Lady, with a leading smile.
&ldquo;Oh, cut it out,&rdquo; said Fuzzy, ill-manneredly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember. Drink hearty.&rdquo;
Fuzzy had shot his arrow. They drank. The Lady smiled again the smile of her caste.
James enveloped and re-conducted him toward the front door. The harp music still softly
drifted through the house.
Outside, Black Riley breathed on his cold hands and hugged the gate.
&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the Lady to herself, musing, &ldquo;who - but there were so many who came.
I wonder whether memory is a curse or a blessing to them after they have fallen so low.&rdquo;
Fuzzy and his escort were nearly at the door. The Lady called: &ldquo;James!&rdquo;
James stalked back obsequiously, leaving Fuzzy waiting unsteadily, with his brief spark
of the divine fire gone.
Outside, Black Riley stamped his cold feet and got a firmer grip on his section of
gas-pipe.&ldquo;You will conduct this gentleman,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;Downstairs. Then tell Louis to get out
the Mercedes and take him to whatever place he wishes to go.&rdquo;
Confessions of a Humorist （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>There was a painless stage of incubation that lasted twenty-five years, and then it broke
out on me, and people said I was It.
But they called it humor instead of measles.
The employees in the store bought a silver inkstand for the senior partner on his fiftieth
birthday. We crowded into his private office to present it. I had been selected for spokesman,
and I made a little speech that I had been preparing for a week.
It made a hit. It was full of puns and epigrams and funny twists that brought down the
house&ndash;which was a very solid one in the wholesale hardware line. Old Marlowe himself
actually grinned, and the employees took their cue and roared.
My reputation as a humorist dates from half-past nine o&rsquo;clock on that morning. For
weeks afterward my fellow clerks fanned the flame of my self-esteem. One by one they
came to me, saying what an awfully clever speech that was, old man, and carefully explained
to me the point of each one of my jokes.
Gradually I found that I was expected to keep it up. Others might speak sanely on
business matters and the day&rsquo;s topics, but from me something gamesome and airy was
required.
I was expected to crack jokes about the crockery and lighten up the granite ware with
persiflage. I was second bookkeeper, and if I failed to show up a balance sheet without
something comic about the footings or could find no cause for laughter in an invoice of
plows, the other clerks were disappointed. By degrees my fame spread, and I became a local
&ldquo;character.&rdquo; Our town was small enough to make this possible. The daily newspaper quoted
me. At social gatherings I was indispensable.
I believe I did possess considerable wit and a facility for quick and spontaneous
repartee. This gift I cultivated and improved by practice. And the nature of it was kindly and
genial, not running to sarcasm or offending others. People began to smile when they saw me
coming, and by the time we had met I generally had the word ready to broaden the smile
into a laugh.I had married early. We had a charming boy of three and a girl of five. Naturally, we
lived in a vine-covered cottage, and were happy. My salary as bookkeeper in the hardware
concern kept at a distance those ills attendant upon superfluous wealth.
At sundry times I had written out a few jokes and conceits that I considered peculiarly
happy, and had sent them to certain periodicals that print such things. All of them had been
instantly accepted. Several of the editors had written to request further contributions.
One day I received a letter from the editor of a famous weekly publication. He
suggested that I submit to him a humorous composition to fill a column of space; hinting
that he would make it a regular feature of each issue if the work proved satisfactory. I did so,
and at the end of two weeks he offered to make a contract with me for a year at a figure
that was considerably higher than the amount paid me by the hardware firm.
I was filled with delight. My wife already crowned me in her mind with the
imperishable evergreens of literary success. We had lobster croquettes and a bottle of
blackberry wine for supper that night. Here was the chance to liberate myself from drudgery.
I talked over the matter very seriously with Louisa. We agreed that I must resign my place at
the store and devote myself to humor.
I resigned. My fellow clerks gave me a farewell banquet. The speech I made there
coruscated. It was printed in full by the Gazette. The next morning I awoke and looked at the
clock.
&ldquo;Late, by George!&rdquo; I exclaimed, and grabbed for my clothes. Louisa reminded me that I
was no longer a slave to hardware and contractors&rsquo; supplies. I was now a professional
humorist.
After breakfast she proudly led me to the little room off the kitchen. Dear girl! There
was my table and chair, writing pad, ink, and pipe tray. And all the author&rsquo;s trappings&ndash;the
celery stand full of fresh roses and honeysuckle, last year&rsquo;s calendar on the wall, the
dictionary, and a little bag of chocolates to nibble between inspirations. Dear girl!
I sat me to work. The wall paper is patterned with arabesques or odalisks
or&ndash;perhaps&ndash;it is trapezoids. Upon one of the figures I fixed my eyes. I bethought me of
humor.
A voice startled me&ndash;Louisa&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;If you aren&rsquo;t too busy, dear,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;come to dinner.&rdquo;
I looked at my watch. Yes, five hours had been gathered in by the grim scytheman. I
went to dinner.&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t work too hard at first,&rdquo; said Louisa. &ldquo;Goethe&ndash;or was it Napoleon?&ndash;said
five hours a day is enough for mental labor. Couldn&rsquo;t you take me and the children to the
woods this afternoon?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am a little tired,&rdquo; I admitted. So we went to the woods.
But I soon got the swing of it. Within a month I was turning out copy as regular as
shipments of hardware.
And I had success. My column in the weekly made some stir, and I was referred to in a
gossipy way by the critics as something fresh in the line of humorists. I augmented my
income considerably by contributing to other publications.
I picked up the tricks of the trade. I could take a funny idea and make a two-line joke of
it, earning a dollar. With false whiskers on, it would serve up cold as a quatrain, doubling its
producing value. By turning the skirt and adding a ruffle of rhyme you would hardly
recognize it as vers de societe with neatly shod feet and a fashion-plate illustration.
I began to save up money, and we had new carpets, and a parlor organ. My
townspeople began to look upon me as a citizen of some consequence instead of the merry
trifier I had been when I clerked in the hardware store.
After five or six months the spontaniety seemed to depart from my humor. Quips and
droll sayings no longer fell carelessly from my lips. I was sometimes hard run for material. I
found myself listening to catch available ideas from the conversation of my friends.
Sometimes I chewed my pencil and gazed at the wall paper for hours trying to build up some
gay little bubble of unstudied fun.
And then I became a harpy, a Moloch, a Jonah, a vampire, to my acquaintances.
Anxious, haggard, greedy, I stood among them like a veritable killjoy. Let a bright saying, a
witty comparison, a piquant phrase fall from their lips and I was after it like a hound
springing upon a bone. I dared not trust my memory; but, turning aside guiltily and meanly, I
would make a note of it in my ever-present memorandum book or upon my cuff for my own
future use.
My friends regarded me in sorrow and wonder. I was not the same man. Where once I
had furnished them entertainment and jollity, I now preyed upon them. No jests from me
ever bid for their smiles now. They were too precious. I could not afford to dispense
gratuitously the means of my livelihood.
I was a lugubrious fox praising the singing of my friends, the crow&rsquo;s, that they might
drop from their beaks the morsels of wit that I coveted.Nearly every one began to avoid me. I even forgot how to smile, not even paying that
much for the sayings I appropriated.
No persons, places, times, or subjects were exempt from my plundering in search of
material. Even in church my demoralized fancy went hunting among the solemn aisles and
pillars for spoil.
Did the minister give out the long-meter doxology, at once I began: &ldquo;Doxology
&ndash;sockdology&ndash;sockdolager&ndash;meter&ndash;meet her.&rdquo;
The sermon ran through my mental sieve, its precepts filtering unheeded, could I but
glean a suggestion of a pun or a bon mot. The solemnest anthems of the choir were but an
accompaniment to my thoughts as I conceived new changes to ring upon the ancient
comicalities concerning the jealousies of soprano, tenor, and basso.
My own home became a hunting ground. My wife is a singularly feminine creature,
candid, sympathetic, and impulsive. Once her conversation was my delight, and her ideas a
source of unfailing pleasure. Now I worked her. She was a gold mine of those amusing but
lovable inconsistencies that distinguish the female mind.
I began to market those pearls of unwisdom and humor that should have enriched only
the sacred precincts of home. With devilish cunning I encouraged her to talk. Unsuspecting,
she laid her heart bare. Upon the cold, conspicuous, common, printed page I offered it to
the public gaze.
A literary Judas, I kissed her and betrayed her. For pieces of silver I dressed her sweet
confidences in the pantalettes and frills of folly and made them dance in the market place.
Dear Louisa! Of nights I have bent over her cruel as a wolf above a tender lamb,
hearkening even to her soft words murmured in sleep, hoping to catch an idea for my next
day&rsquo;s grind. There is worse to come.
God help me! Next my fangs were buried deep in the neck of the fugitive sayings of my
little children.
Guy and Viola were two bright fountains of childish, quaint thoughts and speeches. I
found a ready sale for this kind of humor, and was furnishing a regular department in a
magazine with &ldquo;Funny Fancies of Childhood.&rdquo; I began to stalk them as an Indian stalks the
antelope. I would hide behind sofas and doors, or crawl on my hands and knees among the
bushes in the yard to eavesdrop while they were at play. I had all the qualities of a harpy
except remorse.
Once, when I was barren of ideas, and my copy must leave in the next mail, I covered
myself in a pile of autumn leaves in the yard, where I knew they intended to come to play. Icannot bring myself to believe that Guy was aware of my hiding place, but even if he was, I
would be loath to blame him for his setting fire to the leaves, causing the destruction of my
new suit of clothes, and nearly cremating a parent.
Soon my own children began to shun me as a pest. Often, when I was creeping upon
them like a melancholy ghoul, I would hear them say to each other: &ldquo;Here comes papa,&rdquo; and
they would gather their toys and scurry away to some safer hiding place. Miserable wretch
that I was!
And yet I was doing well financially. Before the first year had passed I had saved a
thousand dollars, and we had lived in comfort.
But at what a cost! I am not quite clear as to what a pariah is, but I was everything that
it sounds like. I had no friends, no amusements, no enjoyment of life. The happiness of my
family had been sacrificed. I was a bee, sucking sordid honey from life&rsquo;s fairest flowers,
dreaded and shunned on account of my stingo.
One day a man spoke to me, with a pleasant and friendly smile. Not in months had the
thing happened. I was passing the undertaking establishment of Peter Heffelbower. Peter
stood in the door and saluted me. I stopped, strangely wrung in my heart by his greeting. He
asked me inside.
The day was chill and rainy. We went into the back room, where a fire burned, in a little
stove. A customer came, and Peter left me alone for a while. Presently I felt a new feeling
stealing over me &ndash;a sense of beautiful calm and content, I looked around the place. There
were rows of shining rosewood caskets, black palls, trestles, hearse plumes, mourning
streamers, and all the paraphernalia of the solemn trade. Here was peace, order, silence, the
abode of grave and dignified reflections. Here, on the brink of life, was a little niche
pervaded by the spirit of eternal rest.
When I entered it, the follies of the world abandoned me at the door. I felt no
inclination to wrest a humorous idea from those sombre and stately trappings. My mind
seemed to stretch itself to grateful repose upon a couch draped with gentle thoughts.
A quarter of an hour ago I was an abandoned humorist. Now I was a philosopher, full of
serenity and ease. I had found a refuge from humor, from the hot chase of the shy quip,
from the degrading pursuit of the panting joke, from the restless reach after the nimble
repartee.
I had not known Heffelbower well. When he came back, I let him talk, fearful that he
might prove to be a jarring note in the sweet, dirgelike harmony of his establishment.
But, no. He chimed truly. I gave a long sigh of happiness. Never have I known a man&rsquo;s
talk to be as magnificently dull as Peter&rsquo;s was. Compared with it the Dead Sea is a geyser.Never a sparkle or a glimmer of wit marred his words. Commonplaces as trite and as
plentiful as blackberries flowed from his lips no more stirring in quality than a last week&rsquo;s
tape running from a ticker. Quaking a little, I tried upon him one of my best pointed jokes. It
fell back ineffectual, with the point broken. I loved that man from then on.
Two or three evenings each week I would steal down to Heffelbower&rsquo;s and revel in his
back room. That was my only joy. I began to rise early and hurry through my work, that I
might spend more time in my haven. In no other place could I throw off my habit of
extracting humorous ideas from my surroundings. Peter&rsquo;s talk left me no opening had I
besieged it ever so hard.
Under this influence I began to improve in spirits. It was the recreation from one&rsquo;s labor
which every man needs. I surprised one or two of my former friends by throwing them a
smile and a cheery word as I passed them on the streets. Several times I dumfounded my
family by relaxing long enough to make a jocose remark in their presence.
I had so long been ridden by the incubus of humor that I seized my hours of holiday
with a schoolboy&rsquo;s zest.
Mv work began to suffer. It was not the pain and burden to me that it had been. I often
whistled at my desk, and wrote with far more fluency than before. I accomplished my tasks
impatiently, as anxious to be off to my helpful retreat as a drunkard is to get to his tavern.
My wife had some anxious hours in conjecturing where I spent my afternoons. I
thought it best not to tell her; women do not understand these things. Poor girl!&ndash;she had
one shock out of it.
One day I brought home a silver coffin handle for a paper weight and a fine, fluffy
hearse plume to dust my papers with.
I loved to see them on my desk, and think of the beloved back room down at
Heffelbower&rsquo;s. But Louisa found them, and she shrieked with horror. I had to console her
with some lame excuse for having them, but I saw in her eyes that the prejudice was not
removed. I had to remove the articles, though, at double-quick time.
One day Peter Heffelbower laid before me a temptation that swept me off my feet. In
his sensible, uninspired way he showed me his books, and explained that his profits and his
business were increasing rapidly. He had thought of taking in a partner with some cash. He
would rather have me than any one he knew. When I left his place that afternoon Peter had
my check for the thousand dollars I had in the bank, and I was a partner in his undertaking
business.
I went home with feelings of delirious joy, mingled with a certain amount of doubt. I
was dreading to tell my wife about it. But I walked on air. To give up the writing of humorousstuff, once more to enjoy the apples of life, instead of squeezing them to a pulp for a few
drops of hard cider to make the pubic feel funny&ndash;what a boon that would be!
At the supper table Louisa handed me some letters that had come during my absence.
Several of them contained rejected manuscript. Ever since I first began going to
Heffelbower&rsquo;s my stuff had been coming back with alarming frequency. Lately I had been
dashing off my jokes and articles with the greatest fluency. Previously I had labored like a
bricklayer, slowly and with agony.
Presently I opened a letter from the editor of the weekly with which I had a regular
contract. The checks for that weekly article were still our main dependence. The letter ran
thus:
DEAR SIR:
As you are aware, our contract for the year expires with the present
month. While regretting the necessity for so doing, we must say that
we do not care to renew same for the coming year. We were quite
pleased with your style of humor, which seems to have delighted quite
a large proportion of our readers. But for the past two months we
have noticed a decided falling off in its quality. Your earlier work
showed a spontaneous, easy, natural flow of fun and wit. Of late it
is labored, studied, and unconvincing, giving painful evidence of hard
toil and drudging mechanism.
Again regretting that we do not consider your contributions
available any longer, we are, yours sincerely,
THE EDITOR.
I handed this letter to my wife. After she had read it her face grew extremely long, and
there were tears in her eyes.
&ldquo;The mean old thing!&rdquo; she exclaimed indignantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure your pieces are just as good
as they ever were. And it doesn&rsquo;t take you half as long to write them as it did.&rdquo; And then, I
suppose, Louisa thought of the checks that would cease coming. &ldquo;Oh, John,&rdquo; she wailed,
&ldquo;what will you do now?&rdquo;
For an answer I got up and began to do a polka step around the supper table. I am sure
Louisa thought the trouble had driven me mad; and I think the children hoped it had, for
they tore after me, yelling with glee and emulating my steps. I was now something like their
old playmate as of yore.
&ldquo;The theatre for us to-night!&rdquo; I shouted; &ldquo;nothing less. And a late, wild, disreputable
supper for all of us at the Palace Restaurant. Lumpty-diddle-de-dee-de-dum!&ldquo;And then I explained my glee by declaring that I was now a partner in a prosperous
undertaking establishment, and that written jokes might go hide their heads in sackcloth and
ashes for all me.
With the editor&rsquo;s letter in her hand to justify the deed I had done, my wife could
advance no objections save a few mild ones based on the feminine inability to appreciate a
good thing such as the little back room of Peter Hef&ndash;no, of Heffelbower &amp; Co&rsquo;s. undertaking
establishment.
In conclusion, I will say that to-day you will find no man in our town as well liked, as
jovial, and full of merry sayings as I. My jokes are again noised about and quoted; once more
I take pleasure in my wife&rsquo;s confidential chatter without a mercenary thought, while Guy and
Viola play at my feet distributing gems of childish humor without fear of the ghastly
tormentor who used to dog their steps, notebook in hand.
Our business has prospered finely. I keep the books and look after the shop, while Peter
attends to outside matters. He says that my levity and high spirits would simply turn any
funeral into a regular Irish wake.
The Cop and the Anthem （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>On his bench in Madison Square Soapy moved uneasily. When wild geese honk high of
nights, and when women without sealskin coats grow kind to their husbands, and when
Soapy moves uneasily on his bench in the park, you may know that winter is near at hand.
A dead leaf fell in Soapy&rsquo;s lap. That was Jack Frost&rsquo;s card. Jack is kind to the regular
denizens of Madison Square, and gives fair warning of his annual call. At the corners of four
streets he hands his pasteboard to the North Wind, footman of the mansion of All Outdoors,
so that the inhabitants thereof may make ready.
Soapy&rsquo;s mind became cognisant of the fact that the time had come for him to resolve
himself into a singular Committee of Ways and Means to provide against the coming rigour.
And therefore he moved uneasily on his bench.
The hibernatorial ambitions of Soapy were not of the highest. In them there were no
considerations of Mediterranean cruises, of soporific Southern skies drifting in the Vesuvian
Bay. Three months on the Island was what his soul craved. Three months of assured board
and bed and congenial company, safe from Boreas and bluecoats, seemed to Soapy the
essence of things desirable.For years the hospitable Blackwell&rsquo;s had been his winter quarters. Just as his more
fortunate fellow New Yorkers had bought their tickets to Palm Beach and the Riviera each
winter, so Soapy had made his humble arrangements for his annual hegira to the Island. And
now the time was come. On the previous night three Sabbath newspapers, distributed
beneath his coat, about his ankles and over his lap, had failed to repulse the cold as he slept
on his bench near the spurting fountain in the ancient square. So the Island loomed big and
timely in Soapy&rsquo;s mind. He scorned the provisions made in the name of charity for the city&rsquo;s
dependents. In Soapy&rsquo;s opinion the Law was more benign than Philanthropy. There was an
endless round of institutions, municipal and eleemosynary, on which he might set out and
receive lodging and food accordant with the simple life. But to one of Soapy&rsquo;s proud spirit
the gifts of charity are encumbered. If not in coin you must pay in humiliation of spirit for
every benefit received at the hands of philanthropy. As Caesar had his Brutus, every bed of
charity must have its toll of a bath, every loaf of bread its compensation of a private and
personal inquisition. Wherefore it is better to be a guest of the law, which though conducted
by rules, does not meddle unduly with a gentleman&rsquo;s private affairs.
Soapy, having decided to go to the Island, at once set about accomplishing his desire.
There were many easy ways of doing this. The pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some
expensive restaurant; and then, after declaring insolvency, be handed over quietly and
without uproar to a policeman. An accommodating magistrate would do the rest.
Soapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across the level sea of asphalt,
where Broadway and Fifth Avenue flow together. Up Broadway he turned, and halted at a
glittering cafe, where are gathered together nightly the choicest products of the grape, the
silkworm and the protoplasm.
Soapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest upward. He was
shaven, and his coat was decent and his neat black, ready-tied four-in-hand had been
presented to him by a lady missionary on Thanksgiving Day. If he could reach a table in the
restaurant unsuspected success would be his. The portion of him that would show above the
table would raise no doubt in the waiter&rsquo;s mind. A roasted mallard duck, thought Soapy,
would be about the thing&ndash;with a bottle of Chablis, and then Camembert, a demi-tasse and a
cigar. One dollar for the cigar would be enough. The total would not be so high as to call
forth any supreme manifestation of revenge from the cafe management; and yet the meat
would leave him filled and happy for the journey to his winter refuge.
But as Soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head waiter&rsquo;s eye fell upon his
frayed trousers and decadent shoes. Strong and ready hands turned him about and
conveyed him in silence and haste to the sidewalk and averted the ignoble fate of the
menaced mallard.
Soapy turned off Broadway. It seemed that his route to the coveted island was not to be
an epicurean one. Some other way of entering limbo must be thought of.At a corner of Sixth Avenue electric lights and cunningly displayed wares behind
plate-glass made a shop window conspicuous. Soapy took a cobblestone and dashed it
through the glass. People came running around the corner, a policeman in the lead. Soapy
stood still, with his hands in his pockets, and smiled at the sight of brass buttons.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the man that done that?&rdquo; inquired the officer excitedly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you figure out that I might have had something to do with it?&rdquo; said Soapy, not
without sarcasm, but friendly, as one greets good fortune.
The policeman&rsquo;s mind refused to accept Soapy even as a clue. Men who smash
windows do not remain to parley with the law&rsquo;s minions. They take to their heels. The
policeman saw a man half way down the block running to catch a car. With drawn club he
joined in the pursuit. Soapy, with disgust in his heart, loafed along, twice unsuccessful.
On the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great pretensions. It catered
to large appetites and modest purses. Its crockery and atmosphere were thick; its soup and
napery thin. Into this place Soapy took his accusive shoes and telltale trousers without
challenge. At a table he sat and consumed beefsteak, flapjacks, doughnuts and pie. And then
to the waiter be betrayed the fact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers.
&ldquo;Now, get busy and call a cop,&rdquo; said Soapy. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t keep a gentleman waiting.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No cop for youse,&rdquo; said the waiter, with a voice like butter cakes and an eye like the
cherry in a Manhattan cocktail. &ldquo;Hey, Con!&rdquo;
Neatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters pitched Soapy. He arose,
joint by joint, as a carpenter&rsquo;s rule opens, and beat the dust from his clothes. Arrest seemed
but a rosy dream. The Island seemed very far away. A policeman who stood before a drug
store two doors away laughed and walked down the street.
Five blocks Soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to woo capture again. This
time the opportunity presented what he fatuously termed to himself a &ldquo;cinch.&rdquo; A young
woman of a modest and pleasing guise was standing before a show window gazing with
sprightly interest at its display of shaving mugs and inkstands, and two yards from the
window a large policeman of severe demeanour leaned against a water plug.
It was Soapy&rsquo;s design to assume the role of the despicable and execrated &ldquo;masher.&rdquo; The
refined and elegant appearance of his victim and the contiguity of the conscientious cop
encouraged him to believe that he would soon feel the pleasant official clutch upon his arm
that would insure his winter quarters on the right little, tight little isle.
Soapy straightened the lady missionary&rsquo;s readymade tie, dragged his shrinking cuffs
into the open, set his hat at a killing cant and sidled toward the young woman. He madeeyes at her, was taken with sudden coughs and &ldquo;hems,&rdquo; smiled, smirked and went brazenly
through the impudent and contemptible litany of the &ldquo;masher.&rdquo; With half an eye Soapy saw
that the policeman was watching him fixedly. The young woman moved away a few steps,
and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving mugs. Soapy followed, boldly
stepping to her side, raised his hat and said:
&ldquo;Ah there, Bedelia! Don&rsquo;t you want to come and play in my yard?&rdquo;
The policeman was still looking. The persecuted young woman had but to beckon a
finger and Soapy would be practically en route for his insular haven. Already he imagined he
could feel the cozy warmth of the station-house. The young woman faced him and,
stretching out a hand, caught Soapy&rsquo;s coat sleeve.
Sure, Mike,&rdquo; she said joyfully, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll blow me to a pail of suds. I&rsquo;d have spoke to you
sooner, but the cop was watching.&rdquo;
With the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak Soapy walked past the
policeman overcome with gloom. He seemed doomed to liberty.
At the next corner he shook off his companion and ran. He halted in the district where
by night are found the lightest streets, hearts, vows and librettos.
Women in furs and men in greatcoats moved gaily in the wintry air. A sudden fear
seized Soapy that some dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune to arrest. The
thought brought a little of panic upon it, and when he came upon another policeman
lounging grandly in front of a transplendent theatre he caught at the immediate straw of
&ldquo;disorderly conduct.&rdquo;
On the sidewalk Soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the top of his harsh voice. He
danced, howled, raved and otherwise disturbed the welkin.
The policeman twirled his club, turned his back to Soapy and remarked to a citizen.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis one of them Yale lads celebratin&rsquo; the goose egg they give to the Hartford College.
Noisy; but no harm. We&rsquo;ve instructions to lave them be.&rdquo;
Disconsolate, Soapy ceased his unavailing racket. Would never a policeman lay hands
on him? In his fancy the Island seemed an unattainable Arcadia. He buttoned his thin coat
against the chilling wind.
In a cigar store he saw a well-dressed man lighting a cigar at a swinging light. His silk
umbrella he had set by the door on entering. Soapy stepped inside, secured the umbrella
and sauntered off with it slowly. The man at the cigar light followed hastily.&ldquo;My umbrella,&rdquo; he said, sternly.
&ldquo;Oh, is it?&rdquo; sneered Soapy, adding insult to petit larceny. &ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you call a
policeman? I took it. Your umbrella! Why don&rsquo;t you call a cop? There stands one on the
corner.&rdquo;
The umbrella owner slowed his steps. Soapy did likewise, with a presentiment that luck
would again run against him. The policeman looked at the two curiously.
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the umbrella man&ndash;&ldquo;that is&ndash;well, you know how these mistakes
occur&ndash;I&ndash;if it&rsquo;s your umbrella I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse me&ndash;I picked it up this morning in a
restaurant&ndash;If you recognise it as yours, why&ndash;I hope you&rsquo;ll&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; said Soapy, viciously.
The ex-umbrella man retreated. The policeman hurried to assist a tall blonde in an
opera cloak across the street in front of a street car that was approaching two blocks away.
Soapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improvements. He hurled the
umbrella wrathfully into an excavation. He muttered against the men who wear helmets and
carry clubs. Because he wanted to fall into their clutches, they seemed to regard him as a
king who could do no wrong.
At length Soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where the glitter and turmoil
was but faint. He set his face down this toward Madison Square, for the homing instinct
survives even when the home is a park bench.
But on an unusually quiet corner Soapy came to a standstill. Here was an old church,
quaint and rambling and gabled. Through one violet-stained window a soft light glowed,
where, no doubt, the organist loitered over the keys, making sure of his mastery of the
coming Sabbath anthem. For there drifted out to Soapy&rsquo;s ears sweet music that caught and
held him transfixed against the convolutions of the iron fence.
The moon was above, lustrous and serene; vehicles and pedestrians were few;
sparrows twittered sleepily in the eaves&ndash;for a little while the scene might have been a
country churchyard. And the anthem that the organist played cemented Soapy to the iron
fence, for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers
and roses and ambitions and friends and immaculate thoughts and collars.
The conjunction of Soapy&rsquo;s receptive state of mind and the influences about the old
church wrought a sudden and wonderful change in his soul. He viewed with swift horror the
pit into which he had tumbled, the degraded days, unworthy desires, dead hopes, wrecked
faculties and base motives that made up his existence.And also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this novel mood. An
instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate. He would
pull himself out of the mire; he would make a man of himself again; he would conquer the
evil that had taken possession of him. There was time; he was comparatively young yet; he
would resurrect his old eager ambitions and pursue them without faltering. Those solemn
but sweet organ notes had set up a revolution in him. To-morrow he would go into the
roaring downtown district and find work. A fur importer had once offered him a place as
driver. He would find him to-morrow and ask for the position. He would be somebody in the
world. He would&ndash;
Soapy felt a hand laid on his arm. He looked quickly around into the broad face of a
policeman.
&ldquo;What are you doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo; asked the officer.
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Soapy.
&ldquo;Then come along,&rdquo; said the policeman.
&ldquo;Three months on the Island,&rdquo; said the Magistrate in the Police Court the next morning.
The Cop and the Anthem （O·Henry）</p>

At the next corner he shook off his companion and ran. He halted in the district where
by night are found the lightest streets, hearts, vows and librettos.
Women in furs and men in greatcoats moved gaily in the wintry air. A sudden fear
seized Soapy that some dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune to arrest. The
thought brought a little of panic upon it, and when he came upon another policeman
lounging grandly in front of a transplendent theatre he caught at the immediate straw of
&ldquo;disorderly conduct.&rdquo;
On the sidewalk Soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the top of his harsh voice. He
danced, howled, raved and otherwise disturbed the welkin.
The policeman twirled his club, turned his back to Soapy and remarked to a citizen.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis one of them Yale lads celebratin&rsquo; the goose egg they give to the Hartford College.
Noisy; but no harm. We&rsquo;ve instructions to lave them be.&rdquo;
Disconsolate, Soapy ceased his unavailing racket. Would never a policeman lay hands
on him? In his fancy the Island seemed an unattainable Arcadia. He buttoned his thin coat
against the chilling wind.In a cigar store he saw a well-dressed man lighting a cigar at a swinging light. His silk
umbrella he had set by the door on entering. Soapy stepped inside, secured the umbrella
and sauntered off with it slowly. The man at the cigar light followed hastily.
&ldquo;My umbrella,&rdquo; he said, sternly.
&ldquo;Oh, is it?&rdquo; sneered Soapy, adding insult to petit larceny. &ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you call a
policeman? I took it. Your umbrella! Why don&rsquo;t you call a cop? There stands one on the
corner.&rdquo;
The umbrella owner slowed his steps. Soapy did likewise, with a presentiment that luck
would again run against him. The policeman looked at the two curiously.
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the umbrella man&ndash;&ldquo;that is&ndash;well, you know how these mistakes
occur&ndash;I&ndash;if it&rsquo;s your umbrella I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse me&ndash;I picked it up this morning in a
restaurant&ndash;If you recognise it as yours, why&ndash;I hope you&rsquo;ll&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; said Soapy, viciously.
The ex-umbrella man retreated. The policeman hurried to assist a tall blonde in an
opera cloak across the street in front of a street car that was approaching two blocks away.
Soapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improvements. He hurled the
umbrella wrathfully into an excavation. He muttered against the men who wear helmets and
carry clubs. Because he wanted to fall into their clutches, they seemed to regard him as a
king who could do no wrong.
At length Soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where the glitter and turmoil
was but faint. He set his face down this toward Madison Square, for the homing instinct
survives even when the home is a park bench.
But on an unusually quiet corner Soapy came to a standstill. Here was an old church,
quaint and rambling and gabled. Through one violet-stained window a soft light glowed,
where, no doubt, the organist loitered over the keys, making sure of his mastery of the
coming Sabbath anthem. For there drifted out to Soapy&rsquo;s ears sweet music that caught and
held him transfixed against the convolutions of the iron fence.
The moon was above, lustrous and serene; vehicles and pedestrians were few;
sparrows twittered sleepily in the eaves&ndash;for a little while the scene might have been a
country churchyard. And the anthem that the organist played cemented Soapy to the iron
fence, for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers
and roses and ambitions and friends and immaculate thoughts and collars.The conjunction of Soapy&rsquo;s receptive state of mind and the influences about the old
church wrought a sudden and wonderful change in his soul. He viewed with swift horror the
pit into which he had tumbled, the degraded days, unworthy desires, dead hopes, wrecked
faculties and base motives that made up his existence.
And also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this novel mood. An
instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate. He would
pull himself out of the mire; he would make a man of himself again; he would conquer the
evil that had taken possession of him. There was time; he was comparatively young yet; he
would resurrect his old eager ambitions and pursue them without faltering. Those solemn
but sweet organ notes had set up a revolution in him. To-morrow he would go into the
roaring downtown district and find work. A fur importer had once offered him a place as
driver. He would find him to-morrow and ask for the position. He would be somebody in the
world. He would&ndash;
Soapy felt a hand laid on his arm. He looked quickly around into the broad face of a
policeman.
&ldquo;What are you doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo; asked the officer.
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Soapy.
&ldquo;Then come along,&rdquo; said the policeman.
&ldquo;Three months on the Island,&rdquo; said the Magistrate in the Police Court the next morning.

<hr />

<p>&ldquo;The dispositions of woman,&rdquo; said Jeff Peters, after various opinions on the subject had
been advanced, &ldquo;run, regular, to diversions. What a woman wants is what you&rsquo;re out of. She
wants more of a thing when it&rsquo;s scarce. She likes to have souvenirs of things that never
happened. She likes to be reminded of things she never heard of. A one-sided view of
objects is disjointing to the female composition.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a misfortune of mine, begotten by nature and travel,&rdquo; continued Jeff, looking
thoughtfully between his elevated feet at the grocery stove, &ldquo;to look deeper into some
subjects than most people do. I&rsquo;ve breathed gasoline smoke talking to street crowds in
nearly every town in the United States. I&rsquo;ve held &lsquo;em spellbound with music, oratory, sleight
of hand, and prevarications, while I&rsquo;ve sold &lsquo;em jewelry, medicine, soap, hair tonic, and junkof other nominations. And during my travels, as a matter of recreation and expiation, I&rsquo;ve
taken cognisance some of women. It takes a man a lifetime to find out about one particular
woman; but if he puts in, say, ten years, industrious and curious, he can acquire the general
rudiments of the sex. One lesson I picked up was when I was working the West with a line of
Brazilian diamonds and a patent fire kindler just after my trip from Savannah down through
the cotton belt with Dalby&rsquo;s Anti-explosive Lamp Oil Powder. &lsquo;Twas when the Oklahoma
country was in first bloom. Guthrie was rising in the middle of it like a lump of self-raising
dough. It was a boom town of the regular kind&ndash;you stood in line to get a chance to wash
your face; if you ate over ten minutes you had a lodging bill added on; if you slept on a plank
at night they charged it to you as board the next morning.
&ldquo;By nature and doctrines I am addicted to the habit of discovering choice places
wherein to feed. So I looked around and found a proposition that exactly cut the mustard. I
found a restaurant tent just opened up by an outfit that had drifted in on the tail of the
boom. They had knocked together a box house, where they lived and did the cooking, and
served the meals in a tent pitched against the side. That tent was joyful with placards on it
calculated to redeem the world-worn pilgrim from the sinfulness of boarding houses and
pick-me- up hotels. &lsquo;Try Mother&rsquo;s Home-Made Biscuits,&rsquo; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the Matter with Our Apple
Dumplings and Hard Sauce?&rsquo; &lsquo;Hot Cakes and Maple Syrup Like You Ate When a Boy,&rsquo; &lsquo;Our
Fried Chicken Never Was Heard to Crow&rsquo;&ndash; there was literature doomed to please the
digestions of man! I said to myself that mother&rsquo;s wandering boy should munch there that
night. And so it came to pass. And there is where I contracted my case of Mame Dugan.
&ldquo;Old Man Dugan was six feet by one of Indiana loafer, and he spent his time sitting on
his shoulder blades in a rocking-chair in the shanty memorialising the great corn-crop failure
of &lsquo;96. Ma Dugan did the cooking, and Mame waited on the table.
&ldquo;As soon as I saw Mame I knew there was a mistake in the census reports. There wasn&rsquo;t
but one girl in the United States. When you come to specifications it isn&rsquo;t easy. She was
about the size of an angel, and she had eyes, and ways about her. When you come to the
kind of a girl she was, you&rsquo;ll find a belt of &lsquo;em reaching from the Brooklyn Bridge west as far
as the courthouse in Council Bluffs, Ia. They earn their own living in stores, restaurants,
factories, and offices. They&rsquo;re chummy and honest and free and tender and sassy, and they
look life straight in the eye. They&rsquo;ve met man face to face, and discovered that he&rsquo;s a poor
creature. They&rsquo;ve dropped to it that the reports in the Seaside Library about his being a fairy
prince lack confirmation.
&ldquo;Mame was that sort. She was full of life and fun, and breezy; she passed the repartee
with the boarders quick as a wink; you&rsquo;d have smothered laughing. I am disinclined to make
excavations into the insides of a personal affection. I am glued to the theory that the
diversions and discrepancies of the indisposition known as love should be as private a
sentiment as a toothbrush. &lsquo;Tis my opinion that the biographies of the heart should be
confined with the historical romances of the liver to the advertising pages of the magazines.
So, you&rsquo;ll excuse the lack of an itemised bill of my feelings toward Mame.&ldquo;Pretty soon I got a regular habit of dropping into the tent to eat at irregular times
when there wasn&rsquo;t so many around. Mame would sail in with a smile, in a black dress and
white apron, and say: &lsquo;Hello, Jeff &ndash;why don&rsquo;t you come at mealtime? Want to see how much
trouble you can be, of course. Friedchickenbeefsteakporkchopshamandeggspotpie&rsquo;&ndash;and so
on. She called me Jeff, but there was no significations attached. Designations was all she
meant. The front names of any of us she used as they came to hand. I&rsquo;d eat about two meals
before I left, and string &lsquo;em out like a society spread where they changed plates and wives,
and josh one another festively between bites. Mame stood for it, pleasant, for it wasn&rsquo;t up
to her to take any canvas off the tent by declining dollars just because they were whipped in
after meal times.
&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t long until there was another fellow named Ed Collier got the between-meals
affliction, and him and me put in bridges between breakfast and dinner, and dinner and
supper, that made a three-ringed circus of that tent, and Mame&rsquo;s turn as waiter a
continuous performance. That Collier man was saturated with designs and contrivings. He
was in well-boring or insurance or claim-jumping, or something&ndash;I&rsquo;ve forgotten which. He
was a man well lubricated with gentility, and his words were such as recommended you to
his point of view. So, Collier and me infested the grub tent with care and activity. Mame was
level full of impartiality. &lsquo;Twas like a casino hand the way she dealt out her favours&ndash;one to
Collier and one to me and one to the board, and not a card up her sleeve.
&ldquo;Me and Collier naturally got acquainted, and gravitated together some on the outside.
Divested of his stratagems, he seemed to be a pleasant chap, full of an amiable sort of
hostility.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I notice you have an affinity for grubbing in the banquet hall after the guests have
fled,&rsquo; says I to him one day, to draw his conclusions.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, yes,&rsquo; says Collier, reflecting; &lsquo;the tumult of a crowded board seems to harass my
sensitive nerves.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;It exasperates mine some, too,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Nice little girl, don&rsquo;t you think?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; says Collier, laughing. &lsquo;Well, now that you mention it, I have noticed that she
doesn&rsquo;t seem to displease the optic nerve.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s a joy to mine,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m going after her. Notice is hereby served.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be as candid as you,&rsquo; admits Collier, &lsquo;and if the drug stores don&rsquo;t run out of pepsin
I&rsquo;ll give you a run for your money that&rsquo;ll leave you a dyspeptic at the wind-up.&lsquo;&ldquo;So Collier and me begins the race; the grub department lays in new supplies; Mame
waits on us, jolly and kind and agreeable, and it looks like an even break, with Cupid and the
cook working overtime in Dugan&rsquo;s restaurant.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Twas one night in September when I got Mame to take a walk after supper when the
things were all cleared away. We strolled out a distance and sat on a pile of lumber at the
edge of town. Such opportunities was seldom, so I spoke my piece, explaining how the
Brazilian diamonds and the fire kindler were laying up sufficient treasure to guarantee the
happiness of two, and that both of &lsquo;em together couldn&rsquo;t equal the light from somebody&rsquo;s
eyes, and that the name of Dugan should be changed to Peters, or reasons why not would
be in order.
&ldquo;Mame didn&rsquo;t say anything right away. Directly she gave a kind of shudder, and I began
to learn something.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Jeff,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you spoke. I like you as well as any of them, but there isn&rsquo;t a
man in the world I&rsquo;d ever marry, and there never will be. Do you know what a man is in my
eye? He&rsquo;s a tomb. He&rsquo;s a sarcophagus for the interment of
Beafsteakporkchopsliver&rsquo;nbaconham- andeggs. He&rsquo;s that and nothing more. For two years
I&rsquo;ve watched men eat, eat, eat, until they represent nothing on earth to me but ruminant
bipeds. They&rsquo;re absolutely nothing but something that goes in front of a knife and fork and
plate at the table. They&rsquo;re fixed that way in my mind and memory. I&rsquo;ve tried to overcome it,
but I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve heard girls rave about their sweethearts, but I never could understand it. A
man and a sausage grinder and a pantry awake in me exactly the same sentiments. I went to
a matinee once to see an actor the girls were crazy about. I got interested enough to wonder
whether he liked his steak rare, medium, or well done, and his eggs over or straight up. That
was all. No, Jeff; I&rsquo;ll marry no man and see him sit at the breakfast table and eat, and come
back to dinner and eat, and happen in again at supper to eat, eat, eat.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;But, Mame,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;it&rsquo;ll wear off. You&rsquo;ve had too much of it. You&rsquo;ll marry some time, of
course. Men don&rsquo;t eat always.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;As far as my observation goes, they do. No, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;m going to do.&rsquo; Mame
turns, sudden, to animation and bright eyes. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a girl named Susie Foster in Terre
Haute, a chum of mine. She waits in the railroad eating house there. I worked two years in a
restaurant in that town. Susie has it worse than I do, because the men who eat at railroad
stations gobble. They try to flirt and gobble at the same time. Whew! Susie and I have it all
planned out. We&rsquo;re saving our money, and when we get enough we&rsquo;re going to buy a little
cottage and five acres we know of, and live together, and grow violets for the Eastern market.
A man better not bring his appetite within a mile of that ranch.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t girls ever&ndash;&rsquo; I commenced, but Mame heads me off, sharp.
&ldquo;&lsquo;No, they don&rsquo;t. They nibble a little bit sometimes; that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lsquo;I thought the confect&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, change the subject,&rsquo; says Mame.
&ldquo;As I said before, that experience puts me wise that the feminine arrangement ever
struggles after deceptions and illusions. Take England&ndash;beef made her; wieners elevated
Germany; Uncle Sam owes his greatness to fried chicken and pie, but the young ladies of the
Shetalkyou schools, they&rsquo;ll never believe it. Shakespeare, they allow, and Rubinstein, and the
Rough Riders is what did the trick.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a situation calculated to disturb. I couldn&rsquo;t bear to give up Mame; and yet it
pained me to think of abandoning the practice of eating. I had acquired the habit too early.
For twenty-seven years I had been blindly rushing upon my fate, yielding to the insidious
lures of that deadly monster, food. It was too late. I was a ruminant biped for keeps. It was
lobster salad to a doughnut that my life was going to be blighted by it.
&ldquo;I continued to board at the Dugan tent, hoping that Mame would relent. I had
sufficient faith in true love to believe that since it has often outlived the absence of a square
meal it might, in time, overcome the presence of one. I went on ministering to my fatal vice,
although I felt that each time I shoved a potato into my mouth in Mame&rsquo;s presence I might
be burying my fondest hopes.
&ldquo;I think Collier must have spoken to Mame and got the same answer, for one day he
orders a cup of coffee and a cracker, and sits nibbling the corner of it like a girl in the parlour,
that&rsquo;s filled up in the kitchen, previous, on cold roast and fried cabbage. I caught on and did
the same, and maybe we thought we&rsquo;d made a hit! The next day we tried it again, and out
comes old man Dugan fetching in his hands the fairy viands.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Kinder off yer feed, ain&rsquo;t ye, gents?&rsquo; he asks, fatherly and some sardonic. &lsquo;Thought I&rsquo;d
spell Mame a bit, seein&rsquo; the work was light, and my rheumatiz can stand the strain.&rsquo;
&ldquo;So back me and Collier had to drop to the heavy grub again. I noticed about that time
that I was seized by a most uncommon and devastating appetite. I ate until Mame must
have hated to see me darken the door. Afterward I found out that I had been made the
victim of the first dark and irreligious trick played on me by Ed Collier. Him and me had been
taking drinks together uptown regular, trying to drown our thirst for food. That man had
bribed about ten bartenders to always put a big slug of Appletree&rsquo;s Anaconda Appetite
Bitters in every one of my drinks. But the last trick he played me was hardest to forget.
&ldquo;One day Collier failed to show up at the tent. A man told me he left town that morning.
My only rival now was the bill of fare. A few days before he left Collier had presented me
with a two-gallon jug of fine whisky which he said a cousin had sent him from Kentucky. I
now have reason to believe that it contained Appletree&rsquo;s Anaconda Appetite Bitters almostexclusively. I continued to devour tons of provisions. In Mame&rsquo;s eyes I remained a mere
biped, more ruminant than ever.
&ldquo;About a week after Collier pulled his freight there came a kind of side-show to town,
and hoisted a tent near the railroad. I judged it was a sort of fake museum and curiosity
business. I called to see Mame one night, and Ma Dugan said that she and Thomas, her
younger brother, had gone to the show. That same thing happened for three nights that
week. Saturday night I caught her on the way coming back, and got to sit on the steps a
while and talk to her. I noticed she looked different. Her eyes were softer, and shiny like.
Instead of a Mame Dugan to fly from the voracity of man and raise violets, she seemed to be
a Mame more in line as God intended her, approachable, and suited to bask in the light of
the Brazilians and the Kindler.
&ldquo;&lsquo;You seem to be right smart inveigled,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;with the Unparalleled Exhibition of the
World&rsquo;s Living Curiosities and Wonders.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a change,&rsquo; says Mame.
&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll need another,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;if you keep on going every night.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross, Jeff,&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;it takes my mind off business.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t the curiosities eat?&rsquo; I ask.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Not all of them. Some of them are wax.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Look out, then, that you don&rsquo;t get stuck,&rsquo; says I, kind of flip and foolish.
&ldquo;Mame blushed. I didn&rsquo;t know what to think about her. My hopes raised some that
perhaps my attentions had palliated man&rsquo;s awful crime of visibly introducing nourishment
into his system. She talked some about the stars, referring to them with respect and
politeness, and I drivelled a quantity about united hearts, homes made bright by true
affection, and the Kindler. Mame listened without scorn, and I says to myself, &lsquo;Jeff, old man,
you&rsquo;re removing the hoodoo that has clung to the consumer of victuals; you&rsquo;re setting your
heel upon the serpent that lurks in the gravy bowl.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Monday night I drop around. Mame is at the Unparalleled Exhibition with Thomas.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, may the curse of the forty-one seven-sided sea cooks,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and the bad luck
of the nine impenitent grasshoppers rest upon this self-same sideshow at once and forever
more. Amen. I&rsquo;ll go to see it myself to-morrow night and investigate its baleful charm. Shall
man that was made to inherit the earth be bereft of his sweetheart first by a knife and fork
and then by a ten-cent circus?&lsquo;&ldquo;The next night before starting out for the exhibition tent I inquire and find out that
Mame is not at home. She is not at the circus with Thomas this time, for Thomas waylays me
in the grass outside of the grub tent with a scheme of his own before I had time to eat
supper.
&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;ll you give me, Jeff,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;if I tell you something?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;The value of it, son,&rsquo; I says.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Sis is stuck on a freak,&rsquo; says Thomas, &lsquo;one of the side-show freaks. I don&rsquo;t like him. She
does. I overheard &lsquo;em talking. Thought maybe you&rsquo;d like to know. Say, Jeff, does it put you
wise two dollars&rsquo; worth? There&rsquo;s a target rifle up town that&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;I frisked my pockets and commenced to dribble a stream of halves and quarters into
Thomas&rsquo;s hat. The information was of the pile-driver system of news, and it telescoped my
intellects for a while. While I was leaking small change and smiling foolish on the outside,
and suffering disturbances internally, I was saying, idiotically and pleasantly:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you, Thomas&ndash;thank you&ndash;er&ndash;a freak, you said, Thomas. Now, could you make
out the monstrosity&rsquo;s entitlements a little clearer, if you please, Thomas?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the fellow,&rsquo; says Thomas, pulling out a yellow handbill from his pocket and
shoving it under my nose. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s the Champion Faster of the Universe. I guess that&rsquo;s why Sis
got soft on him. He don&rsquo;t eat nothing. He&rsquo;s going to fast forty-nine days. This is the sixth.
That&rsquo;s him.&rsquo;
&ldquo;I looked at the name Thomas pointed out&ndash;&lsquo;Professor Eduardo Collieri.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; says I, in
admiration, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s not so bad, Ed Collier. I give you credit for the trick. But I don&rsquo;t give you
the girl until she&rsquo;s Mrs. Freak.&rsquo;
&ldquo;I hit the sod in the direction of the show. I came up to the rear of the tent, and, as I did
so, a man wiggled out like a snake from under the bottom of the canvas, scrambled to his
feet, and ran into me like a locoed bronco. I gathered him by the neck and investigated him
by the light of the stars. It is Professor Eduardo Collieri, in human habiliments, with a
desperate look in one eye and impatience in the other.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Hello, Curiosity,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Get still a minute and let&rsquo;s have a look at your freakship. How
do you like being the willopus-wallopus or the bim-bam from Borneo, or whatever name
you are denounced by in the side-show business?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Jeff Peters,&rsquo; says Collier, in a weak voice. &lsquo;Turn me loose, or I&rsquo;ll slug you one. I&rsquo;m in the
extremest kind of a large hurry. Hands off!&lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;Tut, tut, Eddie,&rsquo; I answers, holding him hard; &lsquo;let an old friend gaze on the exhibition
of your curiousness. It&rsquo;s an eminent graft you fell onto, my son. But don&rsquo;t speak of assaults
and battery, because you&rsquo;re not fit. The best you&rsquo;ve got is a lot of nerve and a mighty empty
stomach.&rsquo; And so it was. The man was as weak as a vegetarian cat.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d argue this case with you, Jeff,&rsquo; says he, regretful in his style, &lsquo;for an unlimited
number of rounds if I had half an hour to train in and a slab of beefsteak two feet square to
train with. Curse the man, I say, that invented the art of going foodless. May his soul in
eternity be chained up within two feet of a bottomless pit of red- hot hash. I&rsquo;m abandoning
the conflict, Jeff; I&rsquo;m deserting to the enemy. You&rsquo;ll find Miss Dugan inside contemplating the
only living mummy and the informed hog. She&rsquo;s a fine girl, Jeff. I&rsquo;d have beat you out if I
could have kept up the grubless habit a little while longer. You&rsquo;ll have to admit that the
fasting dodge was aces-up for a while. I figured it out that way. But say, Jeff, it&rsquo;s said that love
makes the world go around. Let me tell you, the announcement lacks verification. It&rsquo;s the
wind from the dinner horn that does it. I love that Mame Dugan. I&rsquo;ve gone six days without
food in order to coincide with her sentiments. Only one bite did I have. That was when I
knocked the tattooed man down with a war club and got a sandwich he was gobbling. The
manager fined me all my salary; but salary wasn&rsquo;t what I was after. &lsquo;Twas that girl. I&rsquo;d give my
life for her, but I&rsquo;d endanger my immortal soul for a beef stew. Hunger is a horrible thing, Jeff.
Love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of
words when a man&rsquo;s starving!&rsquo;
&ldquo;In such language Ed Collier discoursed to me, pathetic. I gathered the diagnosis that
his affections and his digestions had been implicated in a scramble and the commissary had
won out. I never disliked Ed Collier. I searched my internal admonitions of suitable etiquette
to see if I could find a remark of a consoling nature, but there was none convenient.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d be glad, now,&rsquo; says Ed, &lsquo;if you&rsquo;ll let me go. I&rsquo;ve been hard hit, but I&rsquo;ll hit the ration
supply harder. I&rsquo;m going to clean out every restaurant in town. I&rsquo;m going to wade waist deep
in sirloins and swim in ham and eggs. It&rsquo;s an awful thing, Jeff Peters, for a man to come to
this pass&ndash;to give up his girl for something to eat&ndash;it&rsquo;s worse than that man Esau, that
swapped his copyright for a partridge&ndash; but then, hunger&rsquo;s a fierce thing. You&rsquo;ll excuse me,
now, Jeff, for I smell a pervasion of ham frying in the distance, and my legs are crying out to
stampede in that direction.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;A hearty meal to you, Ed Collier,&rsquo; I says to him, &lsquo;and no hard feelings. For myself, I am
projected to be an unseldom eater, and I have condolence for your predicaments.&rsquo;
&ldquo;There was a sudden big whiff of frying ham smell on the breeze; and the Champion
Faster gives a snort and gallops off in the dark toward fodder.
&ldquo;I wish some of the cultured outfit that are always advertising the extenuating
circumstances of love and romance had been there to see. There was Ed Collier, a fine man
full of contrivances and flirtations, abandoning the girl of his heart and ripping out into thecontiguous territory in the pursuit of sordid grub. &lsquo;Twas a rebuke to the poets and a slap at
the best-paying element of fiction. An empty stomach is a sure antidote to an overfull heart.
&ldquo;I was naturally anxious to know how far Mame was infatuated with Collier and his
stratagems. I went inside the Unparalleled Exhibition, and there she was. She looked
surprised to see me, but unguilty.
&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s an elegant evening outside,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;The coolness is quite nice and gratifying, and
the stars are lined out, first class, up where they belong. Wouldn&rsquo;t you shake these
by-products of the animal kingdom long enough to take a walk with a common human who
never was on a programme in his life?&rsquo;
&ldquo;Mame gave a sort of sly glance around, and I knew what that meant.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I hate to tell you; but the curiosity that lives on wind has flew the coop. He
just crawled out under the tent. By this time he has amalgamated himself with half the
delicatessen truck in town.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;You mean Ed Collier?&rsquo; says Mame.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I do,&rsquo; I answers; &lsquo;and a pity it is that he has gone back to crime again. I met him
outside the tent, and he exposed his intentions of devastating the food crop of the world.
&lsquo;Tis enormously sad when one&rsquo;s ideal descends from his pedestal to make a seventeen-year
locust of himself.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Mame looked me straight in the eye until she had corkscrewed my reflections.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Jeff,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t quite like you to talk that way. I don&rsquo;t care to hear Ed Collier
ridiculed. A man may do ridiculous things, but they don&rsquo;t look ridiculous to the girl he does
&lsquo;em for. That was one man in a hundred. He stopped eating just to please me. I&rsquo;d be hardhearted and ungrateful if I didn&rsquo;t feel kindly toward him. Could you do what he did?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; says I, seeing the point, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m condemned. I can&rsquo;t help it. The brand of the
consumer is upon my brow. Mrs. Eve settled that business for me when she made the dicker
with the snake. I fell from the fire into the frying-pan. I guess I&rsquo;m the Champion Feaster of
the Universe.&rsquo; I spoke humble, and Mame mollified herself a little.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Ed Collier and I are good friends,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;the same as me and you. I gave him the
same answer I did you&ndash;no marrying for me. I liked to be with Ed and talk with him. There
was something mighty pleasant to me in the thought that here was a man who never used a
knife and fork, and all for my sake.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t you in love with him?&rsquo; I asks, all injudicious. &lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t there a deal on for you to
become Mrs. Curiosity?&lsquo;&ldquo;All of us do it sometimes. All of us get jostled out of the line of profitable talk now and
then. Mame put on that little lemon glace smile that runs between ice and sugar, and says,
much too pleasant: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re short on credentials for asking that question, Mr. Peters. Suppose
you do a forty-nine day fast, just to give you ground to stand on, and then maybe I&rsquo;ll answer
it.&rsquo;
&ldquo;So, even after Collier was kidnapped out of the way by the revolt of his appetite, my
own prospects with Mame didn&rsquo;t seem to be improved. And then business played out in
Guthrie.
&ldquo;I had stayed too long there. The Brazilians I had sold commenced to show signs of wear,
and the Kindler refused to light up right frequent on wet mornings. There is always a time, in
my business, when the star of success says, &lsquo;Move on to the next town.&rsquo; I was travelling by
wagon at that time so as not to miss any of the small towns; so I hitched up a few days later
and went down to tell Mame good-bye. I wasn&rsquo;t abandoning the game; I intended running
over to Oklahoma City and work it for a week or two. Then I was coming back to institute
fresh proceedings against Mame.
&ldquo;What do I find at the Dugans&rsquo; but Mame all conspicuous in a blue travelling dress, with
her little trunk at the door. It seems that sister Lottie Bell, who is a typewriter in Terre Haute,
is going to be married next Thursday, and Mame is off for a week&rsquo;s visit to be an accomplice
at the ceremony. Mame is waiting for a freight wagon that is going to take her to Oklahoma,
but I condemns the freight wagon with promptness and scorn, and offers to deliver the
goods myself. Ma Dugan sees no reason why not, as Mr. Freighter wants pay for the job; so,
thirty minutes later Mame and I pull out in my light spring wagon with white canvas cover,
and head due south.
&ldquo;That morning was of a praiseworthy sort. The breeze was lively, and smelled excellent
of flowers and grass, and the little cottontail rabbits entertained themselves with skylarking
across the road. My two Kentucky bays went for the horizon until it come sailing in so fast
you wanted to dodge it like a clothesline. Mame was full of talk and rattled on like a kid
about her old home and her school pranks and the things she liked and the hateful ways of
those Johnson girls just across the street, &lsquo;way up in Indiana. Not a word was said about Ed
Collier or victuals or such solemn subjects. About noon Mame looks and finds that the lunch
she had put up in a basket had been left behind. I could have managed quite a collation, but
Mame didn&rsquo;t seem to be grieving over nothing to eat, so I made no lamentations. It was a
sore subject with me, and I ruled provender in all its branches out of my conversation.
&ldquo;I am minded to touch light on explanations how I came to lose the way. The road was
dim and well grown with grass; and there was Mame by my side confiscating my intellects
and attention. The excuses are good or they are not, as they may appear to you. But I lost it,
and at dusk that afternoon, when we should have been in Oklahoma City, we were
seesawing along the edge of nowhere in some undiscovered river bottom, and the rain wasfalling in large, wet bunches. Down there in the swamps we saw a little log house on a small
knoll of high ground. The bottom grass and the chaparral and the lonesome timber crowded
all around it. It seemed to be a melancholy little house, and you felt sorry for it. &lsquo;Twas that
house for the night, the way I reasoned it. I explained to Mame, and she leaves it to me to
decide. She doesn&rsquo;t become galvanic and prosecuting, as most women would, but she says
it&rsquo;s all right; she knows I didn&rsquo;t mean to do it.
&ldquo;We found the house was deserted. It had two empty rooms. There was a little shed in
the yard where beasts had once been kept. In a loft of it was a lot of old hay. I put my horses
in there and gave them some of it, for which they looked at me sorrowful, expecting
apologies. The rest of the hay I carried into the house by armfuls, with a view to
accommodations. I also brought in the patent kindler and the Brazilians, neither of which
are guaranteed against the action of water.
&ldquo;Mame and I sat on the wagon seats on the floor, and I lit a lot of the kindler on the
hearth, for the night was chilly. If I was any judge, that girl enjoyed it. It was a change for her.
It gave her a different point of view. She laughed and talked, and the kindler made a dim
light compared to her eyes. I had a pocketful of cigars, and as far as I was concerned there
had never been any fall of man. We were at the same old stand in the Garden of Eden. Out
there somewhere in the rain and the dark was the river of Zion, and the angel with the
flaming sword had not yet put up the keep-off-the-grass sign. I opened up a gross or two of
the Brazilians and made Mame put them on&ndash;rings, brooches, necklaces, eardrops, bracelets,
girdles, and lockets. She flashed and sparkled like a million-dollar princess until she had pink
spots in her cheeks and almost cried for a looking-glass.
&ldquo;When it got late I made a fine bunk on the floor for Mame with the hay and my lap
robes and blankets out of the wagon, and persuaded her to lie down. I sat in the other room
burning tobacco and listening to the pouring rain and meditating on the many vicissitudes
that came to a man during the seventy years or so immediately preceding his funeral.
&ldquo;I must have dozed a little while before morning, for my eyes were shut, and when I
opened them it was daylight, and there stood Mame with her hair all done up neat and
correct, and her eyes bright with admiration of existence.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Gee whiz, Jeff!&rsquo; she exclaims, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m hungry. I could eat a&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;I looked up and caught her eye. Her smile went back in and she gave me a cold look of
suspicion. Then I laughed, and laid down on the floor to laugh easier. It seemed funny to me.
By nature and geniality I am a hearty laugher, and I went the limit. When I came to, Mame
was sitting with her back to me, all contaminated with dignity.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, Mame,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;for I couldn&rsquo;t help it. It&rsquo;s the funny way you&rsquo;ve done up
your hair. If you could only see it!&lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell stories, sir,&rsquo; said Mame, cool and advised. &lsquo;My hair is all right. I know
what you were laughing about. Why, Jeff, look outside,&rsquo; she winds up, peeping through a
chink between the logs. I opened the little wooden window and looked out. The entire river
bottom was flooded, and the knob of land on which the house stood was an island in the
middle of a rushing stream of yellow water a hundred yards wide. And it was still raining
hard. All we could do was to stay there till the doves brought in the olive branch.
&ldquo;I am bound to admit that conversations and amusements languished during that day. I
was aware that Mame was getting a too prolonged one-sided view of things again, but I had
no way to change it. Personally, I was wrapped up in the desire to eat. I had hallucinations of
hash and visions of ham, and I kept saying to myself all the time, &lsquo;What&rsquo;ll you have to eat,
Jeff?&ndash;what&rsquo;ll you order now, old man, when the waiter comes?&rsquo; I picks out to myself all sorts
of favourites from the bill of fare, and imagines them coming. I guess it&rsquo;s that way with all
hungry men. They can&rsquo;t get their cogitations trained on anything but something to eat. It
shows that the little table with the broken-legged caster and the imitation Worcester sauce
and the napkin covering up the coffee stains is the paramount issue, after all, instead of the
question of immortality or peace between nations.
&ldquo;I sat there, musing along, arguing with myself quite heated as to how I&rsquo;d have my
steak&ndash;with mushrooms, or a la creole. Mame was on the other seat, pensive, her head
leaning on her hand. &lsquo;Let the potatoes come home-fried,&rsquo; I states in my mind, &lsquo;and brown
the hash in the pan, with nine poached eggs on the side.&rsquo; I felt, careful, in my own pockets to
see if I could find a peanut or a grain or two of popcorn.
&ldquo;Night came on again with the river still rising and the rain still falling. I looked at Mame
and I noticed that desperate look on her face that a girl always wears when she passes an
ice-cream lair. I knew that poor girl was hungry&ndash;maybe for the first time in her life. There
was that anxious look in her eye that a woman has only when she has missed a meal or feels
her skirt coming unfastened in the back.
&ldquo;It was about eleven o&rsquo;clock or so on the second night when we sat, gloomy, in our
shipwrecked cabin. I kept jerking my mind away from the subject of food, but it kept
flopping back again before I could fasten it. I thought of everything good to eat I had ever
heard of. I went away back to my kidhood and remembered the hot biscuit sopped in
sorghum and bacon gravy with partiality and respect. Then I trailed along up the years,
pausing at green apples and salt, flapjacks and maple, lye hominy, fried chicken Old Virginia
style, corn on the cob, spareribs and sweet potato pie, and wound up with Georgia
Brunswick stew, which is the top notch of good things to eat, because it comprises &lsquo;em all.
&ldquo;They say a drowning man sees a panorama of his whole life pass before him. Well,
when a man&rsquo;s starving he sees the ghost of every meal he ever ate set out before him, and
he invents new dishes that would make the fortune of a chef. If somebody would collect the
last words of men who starved to death, they&rsquo;d have to sift &lsquo;em mighty fine to discover the
sentiment, but they&rsquo;d compile into a cook book that would sell into the millions.&ldquo;I guess I must have had my conscience pretty well inflicted with culinary meditations,
for, without intending to do so, I says, out loud, to the imaginary waiter, &lsquo;Cut it thick and
have it rare, with the French fried, and six, soft-scrambled, on toast.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Mame turned her head quick as a wing. Her eyes were sparkling and she smiled
sudden.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Medium for me,&rsquo; she rattles out, &lsquo;with the Juliennes, and three, straight up. Draw one,
and brown the wheats, double order to come. Oh, Jeff, wouldn&rsquo;t it be glorious! And then I&rsquo;d
like to have a half fry, and a little chicken curried with rice, and a cup custard with ice cream,
and&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Go easy,&rsquo; I interrupts; &lsquo;where&rsquo;s the chicken liver pie, and the kidney saute on toast,
and the roast lamb, and&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; cuts in Mame, all excited, &lsquo;with mint sauce, and the turkey salad, and stuffed
olives, and raspberry tarts, and&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Keep it going,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Hurry up with the fried squash, and the hot corn pone with
sweet milk, and don&rsquo;t forget the apple dumpling with hard sauce, and the cross-barred
dew-berry pie&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;Yes, for ten minutes we kept up that kind of restaurant repartee. We ranges up and
down and backward and forward over the main trunk lines and the branches of the victual
subject, and Mame leads the game, for she is apprised in the ramifications of grub, and the
dishes she nominates aggravates my yearnings. It seems that there is a feeling that Mame
will line up friendly again with food. It seems that she looks upon the obnoxious science of
eating with less contempt than before.
&ldquo;The next morning we find that the flood has subsided. I geared up the bays, and we
splashed out through the mud, some precarious, until we found the road again. We were
only a few miles wrong, and in two hours we were in Oklahoma City. The first thing we saw
was a big restaurant sign, and we piled into there in a hurry. Here I finds myself sitting with
Mame at table, with knives and forks and plates between us, and she not scornful, but
smiling with starvation and sweetness.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a new restaurant and well stocked. I designated a list of quotations from the bill
of fare that made the waiter look out toward the wagon to see how many more might be
coming.
&ldquo;There we were, and there was the order being served. &lsquo;Twas a banquet for a dozen,
but we felt like a dozen. I looked across the table at Mame and smiled, for I had recollections.
Mame was looking at the table like a boy looks at his first stem-winder. Then she looked atme, straight in the face, and two big tears came in her eyes. The waiter was gone after more
grub.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Jeff,&rsquo; she says, soft like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been a foolish girl. I&rsquo;ve looked at things from the wrong
side. I never felt this way before. Men get hungry every day like this, don&rsquo;t they? They&rsquo;re big
and strong, and they do the hard work of the world, and they don&rsquo;t eat just to spite silly
waiter girls in restaurants, do they, Jeff? You said once&ndash;that is, you asked me&ndash;you wanted
me to&ndash;well, Jeff, if you still care&ndash;I&rsquo;d be glad and willing to have you always sitting across the
table from me. Now give me something to eat, quick, please.&rsquo;
&ldquo;So, as I&rsquo;ve said, a woman needs to change her point of view now and then. They get
tired of the same old sights&ndash;the same old dinner table, washtub, and sewing machine. Give
&lsquo;em a touch of the various&ndash;a little travel and a little rest, a little tomfoolery along with the
tragedies of keeping house, a little petting after the blowing-up, a little upsetting and a little
jostling around&ndash;and everybody in the game will have chips added to their stack by the play.&rdquo;
The Day Resurgent （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>I can see the artist bite the end of his pencil and frown when it comes to drawing his
Easter picture; for his legitimate pictorial conceptions of figures pertinent to the festival are
but four in number.
First comes Easter, pagan goddess of spring. Here his fancy may have free play. A
beautiful maiden with decorative hair and the proper number of toes will fill the bill. Miss
Clarice St. Vavasour, the well-known model, will pose for it in the &ldquo;Lethergogallagher,&rdquo; or
whatever it was that Trilby called it.
Second - the melancholy lady with upturned eyes in a framework of lilies. This is
magazine-covery, but reliable.
Third - Miss Manhattan in the Fifth Avenue Easter Sunday parade.
Fourth - Maggie Murphy with a new red feather in her old straw hat, happy and
self-conscious, in the Grand Street turnout.
Of course, the rabbits do not count. Nor the Easter eggs, since the higher criticism has
hard-boiled them.
The limited field of its pictorial possibilities proves that Easter, of all our festival days, is
the most vague and shifting in our conception. It belongs to all religions, although thepagans invented it. Going back still further to the first spring, we can see Eve choosing with
pride a new green leaf from the tree ficus carica.
Now, the object of this critical and learned preamble is to set forth the theorem that
Easter is neither a date, a season, a festival, a holiday nor an occasion. What it is you shall
find out if you follow in the footsteps of Danny McCree.
Easter Sunday dawned as it should, bright and early, in its place on the calendar
between Saturday and Monday. At 5:24 the sun rose, and at 10:30 Danny followed its
example. He went into the kitchen and washed his face at the sink. His mother was frying
bacon. She looked at his hard, smooth, knowing countenance as he juggled with the round
cake of soap, and thought of his father when she first saw him stopping a hot grounder
between second and third twenty-two years before on a vacant lot in Harlem, where the La
Paloma apartment house now stands. In the front room of the flat Danny&rsquo;s father sat by an
open window smoking his pipe, with his dishevelled gray hair tossed about by the breeze. He
still clung to his pipe, although his sight had been taken from him two years before by a
precocious blast of giant powder that went off without permission. Very few blind men care
for smoking, for the reason that they cannot see the smoke. Now, could you enjoy having
the news read to you from an evening newspaper unless you could see the colors of the
headlines?
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis Easter Day,&rdquo; said Mrs. McCree.
&ldquo;Scramble mine,&rdquo; said Danny.
After breakfast he dressed himself in the Sabbath morning costume of the Canal Street
importing house dray chauffeur - frock coat, striped trousers, patent leathers, gilded trace
chain across front of vest, and wing collar, rolled-brim derby and butterfly bow from
Schonstein&rsquo;s (between Fourteenth Street and Tony&rsquo;s fruit stand) Saturday night sale.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo; out this day, of course, Danny,&rdquo; said old man McCree, a little wistfully.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a kind of holiday, they say. Well, it&rsquo;s fine spring weather. I can feel it in the air.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why should I not be going out?&rdquo; demanded Danny in his grumpiest chest tones.
&ldquo;Should I stay in? Am I as good as a horse? One day of rest my team has a week. Who earns
the money for the rent and the breakfast you&rsquo;ve just eat, I&rsquo;d like to know? Answer me that!&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right, lad,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not complainin&rsquo;. While me two eyes was good
there was nothin&rsquo; better to my mind than a Sunday out. There&rsquo;s a smell of turf and burnin&rsquo;
brush comin&rsquo; in the windy. I have me tobaccy. A good fine day and rist to ye, lad. Times I
wish your mother had larned to read, so I might hear the rest about the hippopotamus - but
let that be.&ldquo;&ldquo;Now, what is this foolishness he talks of hippopotamuses?&rdquo; asked Danny of his mother,
as he passed through the kitchen. &ldquo;Have you been taking him to the Zoo? And for what?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; said Mrs. McCree. &ldquo;He sets by the windy all day. &lsquo;Tis little recreation a
blind man among the poor gets at all. I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; they wander in their minds at times. One
day he talks of grease without stoppin&rsquo; for the most of an hour. I looks to see if there&rsquo;s lard
burnin&rsquo; in the fryin&rsquo; pan. There is not. He says I do not understand. &lsquo;Tis weary days, Sundays,
and holidays and all, for a blind man, Danny. There was no better nor stronger than him
when he had his two eyes. &lsquo;Tis a fine day, son. Injoy yeself ag&rsquo;inst the morning. There will be
cold supper at six.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Have you heard any talk of a hippopotamus?&rdquo; asked Danny of Mike, the janitor, as he
went out the door downstairs.
&ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; said Mike, pulling his shirtsleeves higher. &ldquo;But &lsquo;tis the only subject in the
animal, natural and illegal lists of outrages that I&rsquo;ve not been compained to about these two
days. See the landlord. Or else move out if ye like. Have ye hippopotamuses in the lease? No,
then?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It was the old man who spoke of it,&rdquo; said Danny. &ldquo;Likely there&rsquo;s nothing in it.&rdquo;
Danny walked up the street to the Avenue and then struck northward into the heart of
the district where Easter - modern Easter, in new, bright raiment - leads the pascal march.
Out of towering brown churches came the blithe music of anthems from the choirs. The
broad sidewalks were moving parterres of living flowers - so it seemed when your eye
looked upon the Easter girl.
Gentlemen, frock-coated, silk-hatted, gardeniaed, sustained the background of the
tradition. Children carried lilies in their hands. The windows of the brownstone mansions
were packed with the most opulent creations of flora, the sister of the Lady of the Lilies.
Around a corner, white-gloved, pink-gilled and tightly buttoned, walked Corrigan, the
cop, shield to the curb. Danny knew him.
&ldquo;Why, Corrigan,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;is Easter? I know it comes the first you&rsquo;re full after the
moon rises on the seventeenth of March - but why? Is it a proper and religious ceremony, or
does the Governor appoint it out of politics?&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis an annual celebration,&rdquo; said Corrigan, with the judicial air of the Third Deputy
Police Commissioner, &ldquo;peculiar to New York. It extends up to Harlem. Sometimes they has
the reserves out at One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street. In my opinion &lsquo;tis not political.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Danny. &ldquo;And say - did you ever hear a man complain of hippopotamuses?
When not specially in drink, I mean.&ldquo;&ldquo;Nothing larger than sea turtles,&rdquo; said Corrigan, reflecting, &ldquo;and there was wood
alcohol in that.&rdquo;
Danny wandered. The double, heavy incumbency of enjoying simultaneously a Sunday
and a festival day was his.
The sorrows of the hand-toiler fit him easily. They are worn so often that they hang
with the picturesque lines of the best tailor-made garments. That is why well-fed artists of
pencil and pen find in the griefs of the common people their most striking models. But when
the Philistine would disport himself, the grimness of Melpomene, herself, attends upon his
capers. Therefore, Danny set his jaw hard at Easter, and took his pleasure sadly.
The family entrance of Dugan&rsquo;s cafe was feasible; so Danny yielded to the vernal season
as far as a glass of bock. Seated in a dark, linoleumed, humid back room, his heart and mind
still groped after the mysterious meaning of the springtime jubilee.
&ldquo;Say, Tim,&rdquo; he said to the waiter, &ldquo;why do they have Easter?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Skiddoo!&rdquo; said Tim, closing a sophisticated eye. &ldquo;Is that a new one? All right. Tony
Pastor&rsquo;s for you last night, I guess. I give it up. What&rsquo;s the answer - two apples or a yard and
a half?&rdquo;
From Dugan&rsquo;s Danny turned back eastward. The April sun seemed to stir in him a vague
feeling that he could not construe. He made a wrong diagnosis and decided that it was Katy
Conlon.
A block from her house on Avenue A he met her going to church. They pumped hands
on the corner.
&ldquo;Gee! but you look dumpish and dressed up,&rdquo; said Katy. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Come away
with me to church and be cheerful.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing at church?&rdquo; asked Danny.
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Easter Sunday. Silly! I waited till after eleven expectin&rsquo; you might come
around to go.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What does this Easter stand for, Katy,&rdquo; asked Danny gloomily. &ldquo;Nobody seems to
know.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nobody as blind as you,&rdquo; said Katy with spirit. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t even looked at my new hat.
And skirt. Why, it&rsquo;s when all the girls put on new spring clothes. Silly! Are you coming to
church with me?&ldquo;&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Danny. &ldquo;If this Easter is pulled off there, they ought to be able to give some
excuse for it. Not that the hat ain&rsquo;t a beauty. The green roses are great.&rdquo;
At church the preacher did some expounding with no pounding. He spoke rapidly, for
he was in a hurry to get home to his early Sabbath dinner; but he knew his business. There
was one word that controlled his theme - resurrection. Not a new creation; but a new life
arising out of the old. The congregation had heard it often before. But there was a
wonderful hat, a combination of sweet peas and lavender, in the sixth pew from the pulpit.
It attracted much attention.
After church Danny lingered on a corner while Katy waited, with pique in her sky-blue
eyes.
&ldquo;Are you coming along to the house?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t mind me. I&rsquo;ll get there all
right. You seem to be studyin&rsquo; a lot about something. All right. Will I see you at any time
specially, Mr. McCree?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be around Wednesday night as usual,&rdquo; said Danny, turning and crossing the street.
Katy walked away with the green roses dangling indignantly. Danny stopped two blocks
away. He stood still with his hands in his pockets, at the curb on the corner. His face was that
of a graven image. Deep in his soul something stirred so small, so fine, so keen and leavening
that his hard fibres did not recognize it. It was something more tender than the April day,
more subtle than the call of the senses, purer and deeper-rooted than the love of woman -
for had he not turned away from green roses and eyes that had kept him chained for a year?
And Danny did not know what it was. The preacher, who was in a hurry to go to his dinner,
had told him, but Danny had had no libretto with which to follow the drowsy intonation. But
the preacher spoke the truth.
Suddenly Danny slapped his leg and gave forth a hoarse yell of delight.
&ldquo;Hippopotamus!&rdquo; he shouted to an elevated road pillar. &ldquo;Well, how is that for a bum
guess? Why, blast my skylights! I know what he was driving at now.
&ldquo;Hippopotamus! Wouldn&rsquo;t that send you to the Bronx! It&rsquo;s been a year since he heard it;
and he didn&rsquo;t miss it so very far. We quit at 469 B. C., and this comes next. Well, a wooden
man wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed what he was trying to get out of him.&rdquo;
Danny caught a crosstown car and went up to the rear flat that his labor supported.
Old man McCree was still sitting by the window. His extinct pipe lay on the sill.
&ldquo;Will that be you, lad?&rdquo; he asked.Danny flared into the rage of a strong man who is surprised at the outset of committing
a good deed.
&ldquo;Who pays the rent and buys the food that is eaten in this house?&rdquo; he snapped,
viciously. &ldquo;Have I no right to come in?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re a faithful lad,&rdquo; said old man McCree, with a sigh. &ldquo;Is it evening yet?&rdquo;
Danny reached up on a shelf and took down a thick book labeled in gilt letters, &ldquo;The
History of Greece.&rdquo; Dust was on it half an inch thick. He laid it on the table and found a place
in it marked by a strip of paper. And then he gave a short roar at the top of his voice, and
said:
&ldquo;Was it the hippopotamus you wanted to be read to about then?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Did I hear ye open the book?&rdquo; said old man McCree. &ldquo;Many and weary be the months
since my lad has read it to me. I dinno; but I took a great likings to them Greeks. Ye left off at
a place. &lsquo;Tis a fine day outside, lad. Be out and take rest from your work. I have gotten used
to me chair by the windy and me pipe.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pel-Peloponnesus was the place where we left off, and not hippopotamus,&rdquo; said Danny.
&ldquo;The war began there. It kept something doing for thirty years. The headlines says that a guy
named Philip of Macedon, in 338 B. C., got to be boss of Greece by getting the decision at
the battle of Cher-Cheronaea. I&rsquo;ll read it.&rdquo;
With his hand to his ear, rapt in the Peloponnesian War, old man McCree sat for an
hour, listening.
Then he got up and felt his way to the door of the kitchen. Mrs. McCree was slicing cold
meat. She looked up. Tears were running from old man McCree&rsquo;s eyes.
&ldquo;Do you hear our lad readin&rsquo; to me?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is none finer in the land. My two
eyes have come back to me again.&rdquo;
After supper he said to Danny: &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a happy day, this Easter. And now ye will be off to
see Katy in the evening. Well enough.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Who pays the rent and buys the food that is eaten in this house?&rdquo; said Danny, angrily.
&ldquo;Have I no right to stay in it? After supper there is yet to come the reading of the battle of
Corinth, 146 B. C., when the kingdom, as they say, became an in-integral portion of the
Roman Empire. Am I nothing in this house?&ldquo;The Detective Detector （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>I was walking in Central Park with Avery Knight, the great New York burglar,
highwayman, and murderer.
&ldquo;But, my dear Knight,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it sounds incredible. You have undoubtedly performed
some of the most wonderful feats in your profession known to modern crime. You have
committed some marvellous deeds under the very noses of the police&ndash;you have boldly
entered the homes of millionaires and held them up with an empty gun while you made free
with their silver and jewels; you have sandbagged citizens in the glare of Broadway&rsquo;s electric
lights; you have killed and robbed with superb openness and absolute impunity&ndash;but when
you boast that within forty-eight hours after committing a murder you can run down and
actually bring me face to face with the detective assigned to apprehend you, I must beg
leave to express my doubts&ndash;remember, you are in New York.&rdquo;
Avery Knight smiled indulgently.
&ldquo;You pique my professional pride, doctor,&rdquo; he said in a nettled tone. &ldquo;I will convince
you.&rdquo;
About twelve yards in advance of us a prosperous-looking citizen was rounding a clump
of bushes where the walk curved. Knight suddenly drew a revolver and shot the man in the
back. His victim fell and lay without moving.
The great murderer went up to him leisurely and took from his clothes his money,
watch, and a valuable ring and cravat pin. He then rejoined me smiling calmly, and we
continued our walk.
Ten steps and we met a policeman running toward the spot where the shot had been
fired. Avery Knight stopped him.
&ldquo;I have just killed a man,&rdquo; he announced, seriously, &ldquo;and robbed him of his
possessions.&rdquo;
&ldquo;G&rsquo;wan,&rdquo; said the policeman, angrily, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll run yez in! Want yer name in the papers,
don&rsquo;t yez? I never knew the cranks to come around so quick after a shootin&rsquo; before. Out of
th&rsquo; park, now, for yours, or I&rsquo;ll fan yez.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What you have done,&rdquo; I said, argumentatively, as Knight and I walked on, &ldquo;was easy.
But when you come to the task of hunting down the detective that they send upon your trail
you will find that you have undertaken a difficult feat.&ldquo;&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said Knight, lightly. &ldquo;I will admit that my success depends in a degree
upon the sort of man they start after me. If it should be an ordinary plain-clothes man I
might fail to gain a sight of him. If they honor me by giving the case to some one of their
celebrated sleuths I do not fear to match my cunning and powers of induction against his.&rdquo;
On the next afternoon Knight entered my office with a satisfied look on his keen
countenance.
&ldquo;How goes the mysterious murder?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;As usual,&rdquo; said Knight, smilingly. &ldquo;I have put in the morning at the police station and at
the inquest. It seems that a card case of mine containing cards with my name and address
was found near the body. They have three witnesses who saw the shooting and gave a
description of me. The case has been placed in the hands of Shamrock Jolnes, the famous
detective. He left Headquarters at 11:30 on the assignment. I waited at my address until two,
thinking he might call there.&rdquo;
I laughed, tauntingly.
&ldquo;You will never see Jolnes,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;until this murder has been forgotten, two or
three weeks from now. I had a better opinion of your shrewdness, Knight. During the three
hours and a half that you waited he has got out of your ken. He is after you on true induction
theories now, and no wrongdoer has yet been known to come upon him while thus engaged.
I advise you to give it up.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said Knight, with a sudden glint in his keen gray eye and a squaring of his chin,
&ldquo;in spite of the record your city holds of something like a dozen homicides without a
subsequent meeting of the perpetrator, and the sleuth in charge of the case, I will undertake
to break that record. To-morrow I will take you to Shamrock Jolnes&ndash; I will unmask him
before you and prove to you that it is not an impossibility for an officer of the law and a
manslayer to stand face to face in your city.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll have the sincere thanks of the Police Department.&rdquo;
On the next day Knight called for me in a cab.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been on one or two false scents, doctor,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I know something of
detectives&rsquo; methods, and I followed out a few of them, expecting to find Jolnes at the other
end. The pistol being a .45- caliber, I thought surely I would find him at work on the clue in
Forty-fifth Street. Then, again, I looked for the detective at the Columbia University, as the
man&rsquo;s being shot in the back naturally suggested hazing. But I could not find a trace of him.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&ndash;Nor will you,&rdquo; I said, emphatically.&ldquo;Not by ordinary methods,&rdquo; said Knight. &ldquo;I might walk up and down Broadway for a
month without success. But you have aroused my pride, doctor; and if I fail to show you
Shamrock Jolnes this day, I promise you I will never kill or rob in your city again.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nonsense, man,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;When our burglars walk into our houses and politely
demand, thousands of dollars&rsquo; worth of jewels, and then dine and bang the piano an hour or
two before leaving, how do you, a mere murderer, expect to come in contact with the
detective that is looking for you?&rdquo;
Avery Knight, sat lost in thought for a while. At length he looked up brightly.
&ldquo;Doc,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have it. Put on your hat, and come with me. In half an hour I
guarantee that you shall stand in the presence of Shamrock Jolnes.&rdquo;
I entered a cab with Avery Knight. I did not hear his instructions to the driver, but the
vehicle set out at a smart pace up Broadway, turning presently into Fifth Avenue, and
proceeding northward again. It was with a rapidly beating heart that I accompanied this
wonderful and gifted assassin, whose analytical genius and superb self- confidence had
prompted him to make me the tremendous promise of bringing me into the presence of a
murderer and the New York detective in pursuit of him simultaneously. Even yet I could not
believe it possible.
&ldquo;Are you sure that you are not being led into some trap?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Suppose that your
clue, whatever it is, should bring us only into the presence of the Commissioner of Police
and a couple of dozen cops!&rdquo;
&ldquo;My dear doctor,&rdquo; said Knight, a little stiffly. &ldquo;I would remind you that I am no gambler.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But I do not think you will find Jolnes.&rdquo;
The cab stopped before one of the handsomest residences on the avenue. Walking up
and down in front of the house was a man with long red whiskers, with a detective&rsquo;s badge
showing on the lapel of his coat. Now and then the man would remove his whiskers to wipe
his face, and then I would recognize at once the well-known features of the great New York
detective. Jolnes was keeping a sharp watch upon the doors and windows of the house.
&ldquo;Well, doctor,&rdquo; said Knight, unable to repress a note of triumph in his voice, &ldquo;have you
seen?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is wonderful&ndash;wonderful!&rdquo; I could not help exclaiming as our cab started on its return
trip. &ldquo;But how did you do it? By what process of induction&ndash;&rdquo;&ldquo;My dear doctor,&rdquo; interrupted the great murderer, &ldquo;the inductive theory is what the
detectives use. My process is more modern. I call it the saltatorial theory. Without bothering
with the tedious mental phenomena necessary to the solution of a mystery from slight clues,
I jump at once to a conclusion. I will explain to you the method I employed in this case.
&ldquo;In the first place, I argued that as the crime was committed in New York City in broad
daylight, in a public place and under peculiarly atrocious circumstances, and that as the
most skilful sleuth available was let loose upon the case, the perpetrator would never be
discovered. Do you not think my postulation justified by precedent?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; I replied, doggedly. &ldquo;But if Big Bill Dev&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Stop that,&rdquo; interrupted Knight, with a smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that several times. It&rsquo;s too late
now. I will proceed.
&ldquo;If homicides in New York went undiscovered, I reasoned, although the best detective
talent was employed to ferret them out, it must be true that the detectives went about their
work in the wrong way. And not only in the wrong way, but exactly opposite from the right
way. That was my clue.
&ldquo;I slew the man in Central Park. Now, let me describe myself to you.
&ldquo;I am tall, with a black beard, and I hate publicity. I have no money to speak of; I do not
like oatmeal, and it is the one ambition of my life to die rich. I am of a cold and heartless
disposition. I do not care for my fellowmen and I never give a cent to beggars or charity.
&ldquo;Now, my dear doctor, that is the true description of myself, the man whom that
shrewd detective was to hunt down. You who are familiar with the history of crime in New
York of late should be able to foretell the result. When I promised you to exhibit to your
incredulous gaze the sleuth who was set upon me, you laughed at me because you said that
detectives and murderers never met in New York. I have demonstrated to you that the
theory is possible.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But how did you do it?&rdquo; I asked again.
&ldquo;It was very simple,&rdquo; replied the distinguished murderer. &ldquo;I assumed that the detective
would go exactly opposite to the clues he had. I have given you a description of myself.
Therefore, he must necessarily set to work and trail a short man with a white beard who
likes to be in the papers, who is very wealthy, is fond &lsquo;of oatmeal, wants to die poor, and is of
an extremely generous and philanthropic disposition. When thus far is reached the mind
hesitates no longer. I conveyed you at once to the spot where Shamrock Jolnes was piping
off Andrew Carnegie&rsquo;s residence.&ldquo;&ldquo;Knight,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a wonder. If there was no danger of your reforming, what a
rounds man you&rsquo;d make for the Nineteenth Precinct!&rdquo;
The Dog and the Playlet （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Usually it is a cold day in July when you can stroll up Broadway in that month and get a
story out of the drama. I found one a few breathless, parboiling days ago, and it seems to
decide a serious question in art.
There was not a soul left in the city except Hollis and me&ndash;and two or three million
sunworshippers who remained at desks and counters. The elect had fled to seashore, lake,
and mountain, and had already begun to draw for additional funds. Every evening Hollis and
I prowled about the deserted town searching for coolness in empty cafes, dining-rooms, and
roofgardens. We knew to the tenth part of a revolution the speed of every electric fan in
Gotham, and we followed the swiftest as they varied. Hollis&rsquo;s fiancee. Miss Loris Sherman,
had been in the Adirondacks, at Lower Saranac Lake, for a month. In another week he would
join her party there. In the meantime, he cursed the city cheerfully and optimistically, and
sought my society because I suffered him to show me her photograph during the black
coffee every time we dined together.
My revenge was to read to him my one-act play.
It was one insufferable evening when the overplus of the day&rsquo;s heat was being hurled
quiveringly back to the heavens by every surcharged brick and stone and inch of iron in the
panting town. But with the cunning of the two-legged beasts we had found an oasis where
the hoofs of Apollo&rsquo;s steed had not been allowed to strike. Our seats were on an ocean of
cool, polished oak; the white linen of fifty deserted tables flapped like seagulls in the
artificial breeze; a mile away a waiter lingered for a heliographic signal&ndash;we might have
roared songs there or fought a duel without molestation.
Out came Miss Loris&rsquo;s photo with the coffee, and I once more praised the elegant poise
of the neck, the extremely low-coiled mass of heavy hair, and the eyes that followed one,
like those in an oil painting.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the greatest ever,&rdquo; said Hollis, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Good as Great Northern
Preferred, and a disposition built like a watch. One week more and I&rsquo;ll be happy
Jonny-on-the-spot. Old Tom Tolliver, my best college chum, went up there two weeks ago.
He writes me that Loris doesn&rsquo;t talk about anything but me. Oh, I guess Rip Van Winkle
didn&rsquo;t have all the good luck!&ldquo;&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said I, hurriedly, pulling out my typewritten play. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s no doubt a charming
girl. Now, here&rsquo;s that little curtain- raiser you promised to listen to.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ever been tried on the stage?&rdquo; asked Hollis.
&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I read half of it the other day to a fellow whose brother
knows Robert Edeson; but he had to catch a train before I finished.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Hollis, sliding back in his chair like a good fellow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no stage carpenter,
but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think of it from a first-row balcony standpoint. I&rsquo;m a theatre bug during
the season, and I can size up a fake play almost as quick as the gallery can. Flag the waiter
once more, and then go ahead as hard as you like with it. I&rsquo;ll be the dog.&rdquo;
I read my little play lovingly, and, I fear, not without some elocution. There was one
scene in it that I believed in greatly. The comedy swiftly rises into thrilling and unexpectedly
developed drama. Capt. Marchmont suddenly becomes cognizant that his wife is an
unscrupulous adventuress, who has deceived him from the day of their first meeting. The
rapid and mortal duel between them from that moment&ndash;she with her magnificent lies and
siren charm, winding about him like a serpent, trying to recover her lost ground; he with his
man&rsquo;s agony and scorn and lost faith, trying to tear her from his heart. That scene I always
thought was a crackerjack. When Capt. Marchmont discovers her duplicity by reading on a
blotter in a mirror the impression of a note that she has written to the Count, he raises his
hand to heaven and exclaims: &ldquo;O God, who created woman while Adam slept, and gave her
to him for a companion, take back Thy gift and return instead the sleep, though it last
forever!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Rot,&rdquo; said Hollis, rudely, when I had given those lines with proper emphasis.
&ldquo;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; I said, as sweetly as I could.
&ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; went on Hollis, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be an idiot. You know very well that nobody spouts
any stuff like that these days. That sketch went along all right until you rang in the skyrockets.
Cut out that right-arm exercise and the Adam and Eve stunt, and make your captain talk as
you or I or Bill Jones would.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit,&rdquo; said I, earnestly (for my theory was being touched upon), &ldquo;that on all
ordinary occasions all of us use commonplace language to convey our thoughts. You will
rememberthat up to the moment when the captain makes his terrible discovery all the
characters on the stage talk pretty much as they would, in real life. But I believe that I am
right in allowing him lines suitable to the strong and tragic situation into which he falls.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tragic, my eye!&rdquo; said my friend, irreverently. &ldquo;In Shakespeare&rsquo;s day he might have
sputtered out some high-cockalorum nonsense of that sort, because in those days theyordered ham and eggs in blank verse and discharged the cook with an epic. But not for
B&rsquo;way in the summer of 1905!&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is my opinion,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that great human emotions shake up our vocabulary and
leave the words best suited to express them on top. A sudden violent grief or loss or
disappointment will bring expressions out of an ordinary man as strong and solemn and
dramatic as those used in fiction or on the stage to portray those emotions.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you fellows are wrong,&rdquo; said Hollis. &ldquo;Plain, every-day talk is what goes.
Your captain would very likely have kicked the cat, lit a cigar, stirred up a highball, and
telephoned for a lawyer, instead of getting off those Robert Mantell pyrotechnics.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Possibly, a little later,&rdquo; I continued. &ldquo;But just at the time&ndash;just as the blow is delivered,
if something Scriptural or theatrical and deep-tongued isn&rsquo;t wrung from a man in spite of his
modern and practical way of speaking, then I&rsquo;m wrong.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Hollis, kindly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to whoop her up some degrees for the stage.
The audience expects it. When the villain kidnaps little Effie you have to make her mother
claw some chunks out of the atmosphere, and scream: &ldquo;Me chee-ild, me chee-ild!&rdquo; What
she would actually do would be to call up the police by &lsquo;phone, ring for some strong tea, and
get the little darling&rsquo;s photo out, ready for the reporters. When you get your villain in a
corner&ndash;a stage corner &ndash;it&rsquo;s all right for him to clap his hand to his forehead and hiss: &ldquo;All is
lost!&rdquo; Off the stage he would remark: &ldquo;This is a conspiracy against me&ndash; I refer you to my
lawyers.&lsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I get no consolation,&rdquo; said I, gloomily, &ldquo;from your concession of an accentuated stage
treatment. In my play I fondly hoped that I was following life. If people in real life meet great
crises in a commonplace way, they should do the same on the stage.&rdquo;
And then we drifted, like two trout, out of our cool pool in the great hotel and began to
nibble languidly at the gay flies in the swift current of Broadway. And our question of
dramatic art was unsettled.
We nibbled at the flies, and avoided the hooks, as wise trout do; but soon the
weariness of Manhattan in summer overcame us. Nine stories up, facing the south, was
Hollis&rsquo;s apartment, and we soon stepped into an elevator bound for that cooler haven.
I was familiar in those quarters, and quickly my play was forgotten, and I stood at a
sideboard mixing things, with cracked ice and glasses all about me. A breeze from the bay
came in the windows not altogether blighted by the asphalt furnace over which it had
passed. Hollis, whistling softly, turned over a late-arrived letter or two on his table, and drew
around the coolest wicker armchairs.I was just measuring the Vermouth carefully when I heard a sound. Some man&rsquo;s voice
groaned hoarsely: &ldquo;False, oh, God!&ndash;false, and Love is a lie and friendship but the byword of
devils!&rdquo;
I looked around quickly. Hollis lay across the table with his head down upon his
outstretched arms. And then he looked up at me and laughed in his ordinary manner.
I knew him&ndash;he was poking fun at me about my theory. And it did seem so unnatural,
those swelling words during our quiet gossip, that I half began to believe I had been
mistaken&ndash;that my theory was wrong.
Hollis raised himself slowly from the table.
&ldquo;You were right about that theatrical business, old man,&rdquo; he said, quietly, as he tossed a
note to me.
I read it.
Loris had run away with Tom Tolliver.
The Duel （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The gods, lying beside their nectar on &lsquo;Lympus and peeping over the edge of the cliff,
perceive a difference in cities. Although it would seem that to their vision towns must
appear as large or small ant-hills without special characteristics, yet it is not so. Studying the
habits of ants frm so great a height should be but a mild diversion when coupled with the
soft drink that mythology tells us is their only solace. But doubtless they have amused
themselves by the comparison of villages and towns; and it will be no news to them (nor,
perhaps, to many mortals), that in one particularity New York stands unique among the
cities of the world. This shall be the theme of a little story addressed to the man who sits
smoking with his Sabbath-slippered feet on another chair, and to the woman who snatches
the paper for a moment while boiling greens or a narcotized baby leaves her free. With
these I love to sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of Kings.
New York City is inhabited by 4,000,000 mysterious strangers; thus beating Bird Centre
by three millions and half a dozen nine&rsquo;s. They came here in various ways and for many
reasons - Hendrik Hudson, the art schools, green goods, the stork, the annual dressmakers&rsquo;
convention, the Pennsylvania Railroad, love of money, the stage, cheap excursion rates,
brains, personal column ads., heavy walking shoes, ambition, freight trains - all these have
had a hand in making up the population.But every man Jack when he first sets foot on the stones of Manhattan has got to fight.
He has got to fight at once until either he or his adversary wins. There is no resting between
rounds, for there are no rounds. It is slugging from the first. It is a fight to a finish.
Your opponent is the City. You must do battle with it from the time the ferry-boat lands
you on the island until either it is yours or it has conquered you. It is the same whether you
have a million in your pocket or only the price of a week&rsquo;s lodging.
The battle is to decide whether you shall become a New Yorker or turn the rankest
outlander and Philistine. You must be one or the other. You cannot remain neutral. You must
be for or against - lover or enemy - bosom friend or outcast. And, oh, the city is a general in
the ring. Not only by blows does it seek to subdue you. It woos you to its heart with the
subtlety of a siren. It is a combination of Delilah, green Chartreuse, Beethoven, chloral and
John L. in his best days.
In other cities you may wander and abide as a stranger man as long as you please. You
may live in Chicago until your hair whitens, and be a citizen and still prate of beans if Boston
mothered you, and without rebuke. You may become a civic pillar in any other town but
Knickerbocker&rsquo;s, and all the time publicly sneering at its buildings, comparing them with the
architecture of Colonel Telfair&rsquo;s residence in Jackson, Miss., whence you hail, and you will
not be set upon. But in New York you must be either a New Yorker or an invader of a
modern Troy, concealed in the wooden horse of your conceited provincialism. And this
dreary preamble is only to introduce to you the unimportant figures of William and Jack.
They came out of the West together, where they had been friends. They came to dig
their fortunes out of the big city.
Father Knickerbocker met them at the ferry, giving one a right-hander on the nose and
the other an upper-cut with his left, just to let them know that the fight was on.
William was for business; Jack was for Art. Both were young and ambitious; so they
countered and clinched. I think they were from Nebraska or possibly Missouri or Minnesota.
Anyhow, they were out for success and scraps and scads, and they tackled the city like two
Lochinvars with brass knucks and a pull at the City Hall.
Four years afterward William and Jack met at luncheon. The business man blew in like a
March wind, hurled his silk hat at a waiter, dropped into the chair that was pushed under
him, seized the bill of fare, and had ordered as far as cheese before the artist had time to do
more than nod. After the nod a humorous smile came into his eyes.
&ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re done for. The city has gobbled you up. It has taken you and cut
you to its pattern and stamped you with its brand. You are so nearly like ten thousand men Ihave seen to-day that you couldn&rsquo;t be picked out from them if it weren&rsquo;t for your laundry
marks.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Camembert,&rdquo; finished William. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? Oh, you&rsquo;ve still got your hammer out for
New York, have you? Well, little old Noisyville-on-the-Subway is good enough for me. It&rsquo;s
giving me mine. And, say, I used to think the West was the whole round world - only slightly
flattened at the poles whenever Bryan ran. I used to yell myself hoarse about the free
expense, and hang my hat on the horizon, and say cutting things in the grocery to little soap
drummers from the East. But I&rsquo;d never seen New York, then, Jack. Me for it from the
rathskellers up. Sixth Avenue is the West to me now. Have you heard this fellow Crusoe sing?
The desert isle for him, I say, but my wife made me go. Give me May Irwin or E. S. Willard
any time.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Poor Billy,&rdquo; said the artist, delicately fingering a cigarette. &ldquo;You remember, when we
were on our way to the East how we talked about this great, wonderful city, and how we
meant to conquer it and never let it get the best of us? We were going to be just the same
fellows we had always been, and never let it master us. It has downed you, old man. You
have changed from a maverick into a butterick.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see exactly what you are driving at,&rdquo; said William. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wear an alpaca coat
with blue trousers and a seersucker vest on dress occasions, like I used to do at home. You
talk about being cut to a pattern - well, ain&rsquo;t the pattern all right? When you&rsquo;re in Rome
you&rsquo;ve got to do as the Dagoes do. This town seems to me to have other alleged
metropolises skinned to flag stations. According to the railroad schedule I&rsquo;ve got in mind,
Chicago and Saint Jo and Paris, France, are asterisk stops - which means you wave a red flag
and get on every other Tuesday. I like this little suburb of Tarrytown-on-the-Hudson. There&rsquo;s
something or somebody doing all the time. I&rsquo;m clearing $8,000 a year selling automatic
pumps, and I&rsquo;m living like kings-up. Why, yesterday, I was introduced to John W. Gates. I took
an auto ride with a wine agent&rsquo;s sister. I saw two men run over by a street car, and I seen
Edna May play in the evening. Talk about the West, why, the other night I woke everybody
up in the hotel hollaring. I dreamed I was walking on a board sidewalk in Oshkosh. What
have you got against this town, Jack? There&rsquo;s only one thing in it that I don&rsquo;t care for, and
that&rsquo;s a ferryboat.&rdquo;
The artist gazed dreamily at the cartridge paper on the wall. &ldquo;This town,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is a
leech. It drains the blood of the country. Whoever comes to it accepts a challenge to a duel.
Abandoning the figure of the leech, it is a juggernaut, a Moloch, a monster to which the
innocence, the genius, and the beauty of the land must pay tribute. Hand to hand every
newcomer must struggle with the leviathan. You&rsquo;ve lost, Billy. It shall never conquer me. I
hate it as one hates sin or pestilence or - the color work in a ten-cent magazine. I despise its
very vastness and power. It has the poorest millionaires, the littlest great men, the lowest
skyscrapers, the dolefulest pleasures of any town I ever saw. It has caught you, old man, but
I will never run beside its chariot wheels. It glosses itself as the Chinaman glosses his collars.
Give me the domestic finish. I could stand a town ruled by wealth or one ruled by anaristocracy; but this is one controlled by its lowest ingredients. Claiming culture, it is the
crudest; asseverating its pre-eminence, it is the basest; denying all outside values and virtue,
it is the narrowest. Give me the pure and the open heart of the West country. I would go
back there to-morrow if I could.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like this filet mgnon?&rdquo; said William. &ldquo;Shucks, now, what&rsquo;s the use to knock
the town! It&rsquo;s the greatest ever. I couldn&rsquo;t sell one automatic pump between Harrisburg and
Tommy O&rsquo;Keefe&rsquo;s saloon, in Sacramento, where I sell twenty here. And have you seen Sara
Bernardt in &lsquo;Andrew Mack&rsquo; yet?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The town&rsquo;s got you, Billy,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said William. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to buy a cottage on Lake Ronkonkoma next
summer.&rdquo;
At midnight Jack raised his window and sat close to it. He caught his breath at what he
saw, though he had seen and felt it a hundred times.
Far below and around lay the city like a ragged purple dream. The irregular houses were
like the broken exteriors of cliffs lining deep gulches and winding streams. Some were
mountainous; some lay in long, desert canons. Such was the background of the wonderful,
cruel, enchanting, bewildering, fatal, great city. But into this background were cut myriads of
brilliant parallelograms and circles and squares through which glowed many colored lights.
And out of the violet and purple depths ascended like the city&rsquo;s soul sounds and odors and
thrills that make up the civic body. There arose the breath of gaiety unrestrained, of love, of
hate, of all the passions that man can know. There below him lay all things, good or bad, that
can be brought from the four corners of the earth to instruct, please, thrill, enrich, despoil,
elevate, cast down, nurture or kill. Thus the flavor of it came up to him and went into his
blood.
There was a knock on his door. A telegram had come for him. It came from the West,
and these were its words:
&ldquo;Come back and the answer will be yes. &ldquo;DOLLY.&rdquo;
He kept the boy waiting ten minutes, and then wrote the reply: &ldquo;Impossible to leave
here at present.&rdquo; Then he sat at the window again and let the city put its cup of mandragora
to his lips again.
After all it isn&rsquo;t a story; but I wanted to know which one of the heroes won the battle
against the city. So I went to a very learned friend and laid the case before him. What he said
was: &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t bother me; I have Christmas presents to buy.&rdquo;
So there it rests; and you will have to decide for yourself.The Duplicity of Hargraves （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>When Major Pendleton Talbot, of Mobile, sir, and his daughter, Miss Lydia Talbot, came
to Washington to reside, they selected for a boarding place a house that stood fifty yards
back from one of the quietest avenues. It was an old-fashioned brick building, with a portico
upheld by tall white pillars. The yard was shaded by stately locusts and elms, and a catalpa
tree in season rained its pink and white blossoms upon the grass. Rows of high box bushes
lined the fence and walks. It was the Southern style and aspect of the place that pleased the
eyes of the Talbots.
In this pleasant private boarding house they engaged rooms, including a study for
Major Talbot, who was adding the finishing chapters to his book, Anecdotes and
Reminiscences of the Alabama Army, Bench, and Bar.
Major Talbot was of the old, old South. The present day had little interest or excellence
in his eyes. His mind lived in that period before the Civil War when the Talbots owned
thousands of acres of fine cotton land and the slaves to till them; when the family mansion
was the scene of princely hospitality, and drew its guests from the aristocracy of the South.
Out of that period he had brought all its old pride and scruples of honor, an antiquated and
punctilious politeness, and (you would think) its wardrobe.
Such clothes were surely never made within fifty years. The Major was tall, but
whenever he made that wonderful, archaic genuflexion he called a bow, the corners of his
frock coat swept the floor. That garment was a surprise even to Washington, which has long
ago ceased to shy at the frocks and broad-brimmed hats of Southern Congressmen. One of
the boarders christened it a &ldquo;Father Hubbard,&rdquo; and it certainly was high in the waist and full
in the skirt.
But the Major, with all his queer clothes, his immense area of plaited, raveling shirt
bosom, and the little black string tie with the bow always slipping on one side, both was
smiled at and liked in Mrs. Vardeman&rsquo;s select boarding house. Some of the young
department clerks would often &ldquo;string him,&rdquo; as they called it, getting him started upon the
subject dearest to him&ndash;the traditions and history of his beloved Southland. During his talks
he would quote freely from the Anecdotes and Reminiscences. But they were very careful
not to let him see their designs, for in spite of his sixty-eight years he could make the boldest
of them uncomfortable under the steady regard of his piercing gray eyes.
Miss Lydia was a plump, little old maid of thirty-five, with smoothly drawn, tightly
twisted hair that made her look still older. Old-fashioned, too, she was; but antebellum glorydid not radiate from her as it did from the Major. She possessed a thrifty common sense,
and it was she who handled the finances of the family, and met all comers when there were
bills to pay. The Major regarded board bills and wash bills as contemptible nuisances. They
kept coming in so persistently and so often. Why, the Major wanted to know, could they not
be filed and paid in a lump sum at some convenient period&ndash;say when the Anecdotes and
Reminiscences had been published and paid for? Miss Lydia would calmly go on with her
sewing and say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pay as we go as long as the money lasts, and then perhaps they&rsquo;ll
have to lump it.&rdquo;
Most of Mrs. Vardeman&rsquo;s boarders were away during the day, being nearly all
department clerks and business men; but there was one of them who was about the house
a great deal from morning to night. This was a young man named Henry Hopkins
Hargraves&ndash;every one in the house addressed him by his full name&ndash;who was engaged at one
of the popular vaudeville theaters. Vaudeville has risen to such a respectable plane in the
last few years, and Mr. Hargraves was such a modest and well-mannered person, that Mrs.
Vardeman could find no objection to enrolling him upon her list of boarders.
At the theater Hargraves was known as an all-round dialect comedian, having a large
repertoire of German, Irish, Swede, and black-face specialties. But Mr. Hargraves was
ambitious, and often spoke of his great desire to succeed in legitimate comedy.
This young man appeared to conceive a strong fancy for Major Talbot. Whenever that
gentleman would begin his Southern reminiscences, or repeat some of the liveliest of the
anecdotes, Hargraves could always be found, the most attentive among his listeners.
For a time the Major showed an inclination to discourage the advances of the &ldquo;play
actor,&rdquo; as he privately termed him; but soon the young man&rsquo;s agreeable manner and
indubitable appreciation of the old gentleman&rsquo;s stories completely won him over.
It was not long before the two were like old chums. The Major set apart each afternoon
to read to him the manuscript of his book. During the anecdotes Hargraves never failed to
laugh at exactly the right point. The Major was moved to declare to Miss Lydia one day that
young Hargraves possessed remarkable perception and a gratifying respect for the old
regime. And when it came to talking of those old days&ndash;if Major Talbot liked to talk, Mr.
Hargraves was entranced to listen.
Like almost all old people who talk of the past, the Major loved to linger over details. In
describing the splendid, almost royal, days of the old planters, he would hesitate until he
had recalled the name of the negro who held his horse, or the exact date of certain minor
happenings, or the number of bales of cotton raised in such a year; but Hargraves never
grew impatient or lost interest. On the contrary, he would advance questions on a variety of
subjects connected with the life of that time, and he never failed to extract ready replies.The fox hunts, the &lsquo;possum suppers, the hoe-downs and jubilees in the negro quarters,
the banquets in the plantation-house hall, when invitations went for fifty miles around; the
occasional feuds with the neighboring gentry; the Major&rsquo;s duel with Rathbone Culbertson
about Kitty Chalmers, who afterward married a Thwaite of South Carolina; and private yacht
races for fabulous sums on Mobile Bay; the quaint beliefs, improvident habits, and loyal
virtues of the old slaves&ndash;all these were subjects that held both the Major and Hargraves
absorbed for hours at a time.
Sometimes, at night, when the young man would be coming upstairs to his room after
his turn at the theater was over, the Major would appear at the door of his study and beckon
archly to him. Going in, Hargraves would find a little table set with a decanter, sugar bowl,
fruit, and a big bunch of fresh green mint.
&ldquo;It occurred to me,&rdquo; the Major would begin&ndash;he was always ceremonious&ndash;&ldquo;that
perhaps you might have found your duties at the&ndash;at your place of occupation&ndash;sufficiently
arduous to enable you, Mr. Hargraves, to appreciate what the poet might well have had in
his mind when he wrote, &lsquo;tired Nature&rsquo;s sweet restorer&rsquo;&ndash;one of our Southern juleps.&rdquo;
It was a fascination to Hargraves to watch him make it. He took rank among artists
when he began, and he never varied the process. With what delicacy he bruised the mint;
with what exquisite nicety he estimated the ingredients; with what solicitous care he capped
the compound with the scarlet fruit glowing against the dark green fringe! And then the
hospitality and grace with which he offered it, after the selected oat straws had been
plunged into its tinkling depths!
After about four months in Washington, Miss Lydia discovered one morning that they
were almost without money. The Anecdotes and Reminiscences was completed, but
publishers had not jumped at the collected gems of Alabama sense and wit. The rental of a
small house which they still owned in Mobile was two months in arrears. Their board money
for the month would be due in three days. Miss Lydia called her father to a consultation.
&ldquo;No money?&rdquo; said he with a surprised look. &ldquo;It is quite annoying to be called on so
frequently for these petty sums, Really, I&ndash;&rdquo;
The Major searched his pockets. He found only a two-dollar bill, which he returned to
his vest pocket.
&ldquo;I must attend to this at once, Lydia,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Kindly get me my umbrella and I will go
downtown immediately. The congressman from our district, General Fulghum, assured me
some days ago that he would use his influence to get my book published at an early date. I
will go to his hotel at once and see what arrangement has been made.&rdquo;
With a sad little smile Miss Lydia watched him button his &ldquo;Father Hubbard&rdquo; and depart,
pausing at the door, as he always did, to bow profoundly.That evening, at dark, he returned. It seemed that Congressman Fulghum had seen the
publisher who had the Major&rsquo;s manuscript for reading. That person had said that if the
anecdotes, etc., were carefully pruned down about one-half, in order to eliminate the
sectional and class prejudice with which the book was dyed from end to end, he might
consider its publication.
The Major was in a white heat of anger, but regained his equanimity, according to his
code of manners, as soon as he was in Miss Lydia&rsquo;s presence.
&ldquo;We must have money,&rdquo; said Miss Lydia, with a little wrinkle above her nose. &ldquo;Give me
the two dollars, and I will telegraph to Uncle Ralph for some to-night.&rdquo;
The Major drew a small envelope from his upper vest pocket and tossed it on the table.
&ldquo;Perhaps it was injudicious,&rdquo; he said mildly, &ldquo;but the sum was so merely nominal that I
bought tickets to the theater to-night. It&rsquo;s a new war drama, Lydia. I thought you would be
pleased to witness its first production in Washington. I am told that the South has very fair
treatment in the play. I confess I should like to see the performance myself.&rdquo;
Miss Lydia threw up her hands in silent despair.
Still, as the tickets were bought, they might as well be used. So that evening, as they sat
in the theater listening to the lively overture, even Miss Lydia was minded to relegate their
troubles, for the hour, to second place. The Major, in spotless linen, with his extraordinary
coat showing only where it was closely buttoned, and his white hair smoothly roached,
looked really fine and distinguished. The curtain went up on the first act of A Magnolia
Flower, revealing a typical Southern plantation scene. Major Talbot betrayed some interest.
&ldquo;Oh, see!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Lydia, nudging his arm, and pointing to her program.
The Major put on his glasses and read the line in the cast of characters that her fingers
indicated.
Col. Webster Calhoun &hellip;. Mr. Hopkins Hargraves.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our Mr. Hargraves,&rdquo; said Miss Lydia. &ldquo;It must be his first appearance in what he calls
&lsquo;the legitimate.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m so glad for him.&rdquo;
Not until the second act did Col. Webster Calhoun appear upon the stage. When he
made his entry Major Talbot gave an audible sniff, glared at him, and seemed to freeze solid.
Miss Lydia uttered a little, ambiguous squeak and crumpled her program in her hand. For
Colonel Calhoun was made up as nearly resembling Major Talbot as one pea does another.
The long, thin white hair, curly at the ends, the aristocratic beak of a nose, the crumpled,wide, raveling shirt front, the string tie, with the bow nearly under one ear, were almost
exactly duplicated. And then, to clinch the imitation, he wore the twin to the Major&rsquo;s
supposed to be unparalleled coat. High-collared, baggy, empire-waisted, ample-skirted,
hanging a foot lower in front than behind, the garment could have been designed from no
other pattern. From then on, the Major and Miss Lydia sat bewitched, and saw the
counterfeit presentment of a haughty Talbot &ldquo;dragged,&rdquo; as the Major afterward expressed it,
&ldquo;through the slanderous mire of a corrupt stage.&rdquo;
Mr. Hargraves had used his opportunities well. He had caught the Major&rsquo;s little
idiosyncrasies of speech, accent, and intonation and his pompous courtliness to
perfection&ndash;exaggerating all to the purpose of the stage. When he performed that marvelous
bow that the Major fondly imagined to be the pink of all salutations, the audience sent forth
a sudden round of hearty applause.
Miss Lydia sat immovable, not daring to glance toward her father. Sometimes her hand
next to him would be laid against her cheek, as if to conceal the smile which, in spite of her
disapproval, she could not entirely suppress.
The culmination of Hargraves audacious imitation took place in the third act. The scene
is where Colonel Calhoun entertains a few of the neighboring planters in his &ldquo;den.&rdquo;
Standing at a table in the center of the stage, with his friends grouped about him, he
delivers that inimitable, rambling character monologue so famous in A Magnolia Flower, at
the same time that he deftly makes juleps for the party.
Major Talbot, sitting quietly, but white with indignation, heard his best stories retold,
his pet theories and hobbies advanced and expanded, and the dream of the Anecdotes and
Reminiscences served, exaggerated and garbled. His favorite narrative&ndash;that of his duel with
Rathbone Culbertson&ndash;was not omitted, and it was delivered with more fire, egotism, and
gusto than the Major himself put into it.
The monologue concluded with a quaint, delicious, witty little lecture on the art of
concocting a julep, illustrated by the act. Here Major Talbot&rsquo;s delicate but showy science was
reproduced to a hair&rsquo;s breadth&ndash;from his dainty handling of the fragrant weed&ndash;&ldquo;the
one-thousandth part of a grain too much pressure, gentlemen, and you extract the
bitterness, instead of the aroma, of this heaven-bestowed plant&rdquo;&ndash;to his solicitous selection
of the oaten straws.
At the close of the scene the audience raised a tumultuous roar of appreciation. The
portrayal of the type was so exact, so sure and thorough, that the leading characters in the
play were forgotten. After repeated calls, Hargraves came before the curtain and bowed, his
rather boyish face bright and flushed with the knowledge of success.At last Miss Lydia turned and looked at the Major. His thin nostrils were working like the
gills of a fish. He laid both shaking hands upon the arms of his chair to rise.
&ldquo;We will go, Lydia,&rdquo; he said chokingly. &ldquo;This is an abominable&ndash;desecration.&rdquo;
Before he could rise, she pulled him back into his seat.
&ldquo;We will stay it out,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Do you want to advertise the copy by exhibiting the
original coat?&rdquo; So they remained to the end.
Hargraves&rsquo;s success must have kept him up late that night, for neither at the breakfast
nor at the dinner table did he appear.
About three in the afternoon he tapped at the door of Major Talbot&rsquo;s study. The Major
opened it, and Hargraves walked in with his hands full of the morning papers&ndash;too full of his
triumph to notice anything unusual in the Major&rsquo;s demeanor.
&ldquo;I put it all over &lsquo;em last night, Major,&rdquo; he began exultantly. &ldquo;I had my inning, and, I
think, scored. Here&rsquo;s what The Post says:
&ldquo;&lsquo;His conception and portrayal of the old-time Southern colonel, with his absurd
grandiloquence, his eccentric garb, his quaint idioms and phrases, his motheaten pride of
family, and his really kind heart, fastidious sense of honor, and lovable simplicity, is the best
delineation of a character role on the boards to-day. The coat worn by Colonel Calhoun is
itself nothing less than an evolution of genius. Mr. Hargraves has captured his public.&rsquo;
&ldquo;How does that sound, Major, for a first-nighter?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I had the honor&rdquo;&ndash;the Major&rsquo;s voice sounded ominously frigid&ndash;&ldquo;of witnessing your
very remarkable performance, sir, last night.&rdquo;
Hargraves looked disconcerted.
&ldquo;You were there? I didn&rsquo;t know you ever&ndash;I didn&rsquo;t know you cared for the theater. Oh, I
say, Major Talbot,&rdquo; he exclaimed frankly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you be offended. I admit I did get a lot of
pointers from you that helped out wonderfully in the part. But it&rsquo;s a type, you know&ndash;not
individual. The way the audience caught on shows that. Half the patrons of that theater are
Southerners. They recognized it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mr. Hargraves,&rdquo; said the Major, who had remained standing, &ldquo;you have put upon me
an unpardonable insult. You have burlesqued my person, grossly betrayed my confidence,
and misused my hospitality. If I thought you possessed the faintest conception of what is the
sign manual of a gentleman, or what is due one, I would call you out, sir, old as I am. I will
ask you to leave the room, sir.&ldquo;The actor appeared to be slightly bewildered, and seemed hardly to take in the full
meaning of the old gentleman&rsquo;s words.
&ldquo;I am truly sorry you took offense,&rdquo; he said regretfully. &ldquo;Up here we don&rsquo;t look at things
just as you people do. I know men who would buy out half the house to have their
personality put on the stage so the public would recognize it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;They are not from Alabama, sir,&rdquo; said the Major haughtily.
&ldquo;Perhaps not. I have a pretty good memory, Major; let me quote a few lines from your
book. In response to a toast at a banquet given in&ndash;Milledgeville, I believe&ndash;you uttered, and
intend to have printed, these words:
&ldquo;&lsquo;The Northern man is utterly without sentiment or warmth except in so far as the
feelings may be turned to his own commercial profit. He will suffer without resentment any
imputation cast upon the honor of himself or his loved ones that does not bear with it the
consequence of pecuniary loss. In his charity, he gives with a liberal hand; but it must be
heralded with the trumpet and chronicled in brass.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Do you think that picture is fairer than the one you saw of Colonel Calhoun last night?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The description,&rdquo; said the Major, frowning, &ldquo;is&ndash;not without grounds. Some
exag&ndash;latitude must be allowed in public speaking.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And in public acting,&rdquo; replied Hargraves.
&ldquo;That is not the point,&rdquo; persisted the Major, unrelenting. &ldquo;It was a personal caricature. I
positively decline to overlook it, sir.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Major Talbot,&rdquo; said Hargraves, with a winning smile, &ldquo;I wish you would understand me.
I want you to know that I never dreamed of insulting you. In my profession, all life belongs to
me. I take what I want, and what I can, and return it over the footlights. Now, if you will, let&rsquo;s
let it go at that. I came in to see you about something else. We&rsquo;ve been pretty good friends
for some months, and I&rsquo;m going to take the risk of offending you again. I know you are hard
up for money&ndash;never mind how I found out, a boarding house is no place to keep such
matters secret&ndash;and I want you to let me help you out of the pinch. I&rsquo;ve been there often
enough myself. I&rsquo;ve been getting a fair salary all the season, and I&rsquo;ve saved some money.
You&rsquo;re welcome to a couple hundred&ndash;or even more&ndash;until you get&mdash;-&rdquo;
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; commanded the Major, with his arm outstretched. &ldquo;It seems that my book
didn&rsquo;t lie, after all. You think your money salve will heal all the hurts of honor. Under no
circumstances would I accept a loan from a casual acquaintance; and as to you, sir, I would
starve before I would consider your insulting offer of a financial adjustment of thecircumstances we have discussed. I beg to repeat my request relative to your quitting the
apartment.&rdquo;
Hargraves took his departure without another word. He also left the house the same
day, moving, as Mrs. Vardeman explained at the supper table, nearer the vicinity of the
downtown theater, where A Magnolia Flower was booked for a week&rsquo;s run.
Critical was the situation with Major Talbot and Miss Lydia. There was no one in
Washington to whom the Major&rsquo;s scruples allowed him to apply for a loan. Miss Lydia wrote
a letter to Uncle Ralph, but it was doubtful whether that relative&rsquo;s constricted affairs would
permit him to furnish help. The Major was forced to make an apologetic address to Mrs.
Vardeman regarding the delayed payment for board, referring to &ldquo;delinquent rentals&rdquo; and
&ldquo;delayed remittances&rdquo; in a rather confused strain.
Deliverance came from an entirely unexpected source.
Late one afternoon the door maid came up and announced an old colored man who
wanted to see Major Talbot. The Major asked that he be sent up to his study. Soon an old
darkey appeared in the doorway, with his hat in hand, bowing, and scraping with one clumsy
foot. He was quite decently dressed in a baggy suit of black. His big, coarse shoes shone with
a metallic luster suggestive of stove polish. His bushy wool was gray&ndash;almost white. After
middle life, it is difficult to estimate the age of a negro. This one might have seen as many
years as had Major Talbot.
&ldquo;I be bound you don&rsquo;t know me, Mars&rsquo; Pendleton,&rdquo; were his first words.
The Major rose and came forward at the old, familiar style of address. It was one of the
old plantation darkeys without a doubt; but they had been widely scattered, and he could
not recall the voice or face.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I do,&rdquo; he said kindly&ndash;&ldquo;unless you will assist my memory.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you &lsquo;member Cindy&rsquo;s Mose, Mars&rsquo; Pendleton, what &lsquo;migrated &lsquo;mediately after de
war?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; said the Major, rubbing his forehead with the tips of his fingers. He
loved to recall everything connected with those beloved days. &ldquo;Cindy&rsquo;s Mose,&rdquo; he reflected.
&ldquo;You worked among the horses&ndash;breaking the colts. Yes, I remember now. After the
surrender, you took the name of&ndash;don&rsquo;t prompt me&ndash;Mitchell, and went to the West&ndash;to
Nebraska.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yassir, yassir,&rdquo;&ndash;the old man&rsquo;s face stretched with a delighted grin&ndash;&ldquo;dat&rsquo;s him, dat&rsquo;s it.
Newbraska. Dat&rsquo;s me&ndash;Mose Mitchell. Old Uncle Mose Mitchell, dey calls me now. Old mars&rsquo;,your pa, gimme a pah of dem mule colts when I lef&rsquo; fur to staht me goin&rsquo; with. You &lsquo;member
dem colts, Mars&rsquo; Pendleton?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to recall the colts,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;You know. I was married the first year
of the war and living at the old Follinsbee place. But sit down, sit down, Uncle Mose. I&rsquo;m
glad to see you. I hope you have prospered.&rdquo;
Uncle Mose took a chair and laid his hat carefully on the floor beside it.
&ldquo;Yessir; of late I done mouty famous. When I first got to Newbraska, dey folks come all
roun&rsquo; me to see dem mule colts. Dey ain&rsquo;t see no mules like dem in Newbraska. I sold dem
mules for three hundred dollars. Yessir&ndash;three hundred.
&ldquo;Den I open a blacksmith shop, suh, and made some money and bought some lan&rsquo;. Me
and my old &lsquo;oman done raised up seb&rsquo;m chillun, and all doin&rsquo; well &lsquo;cept two of &lsquo;em what died.
Fo&rsquo; year ago a railroad come along and staht a town slam ag&rsquo;inst my lan&rsquo;, and, suh, Mars&rsquo;
Pendleton, Uncle Mose am worth leb&rsquo;m thousand dollars in money, property, and lan&rsquo;.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rdquo; said the Major heartily. &ldquo;Glad to hear it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And dat little baby of yo&rsquo;n, Mars&rsquo; Pendleton&ndash;one what you name Miss Lyddy&ndash;I be
bound dat little tad done growed up tell nobody wouldn&rsquo;t know her.&rdquo;
The Major stepped to the door and called: &ldquo;Lydie, dear, will you come?&rdquo;
Miss Lydia, looking quite grown up and a little worried, came in from her room.
&ldquo;Dar, now! What&rsquo;d I tell you? I knowed dat baby done be plum growed up. You don&rsquo;t
&lsquo;member Uncle Mose, child?&rdquo;
&ldquo;This is Aunt Cindy&rsquo;s Mose, Lydia,&rdquo; explained the Major. &ldquo;He left Sunnymead for the
West when you were two years old.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Lydia, &ldquo;I can hardly be expected to remember you, Uncle Mose, at
that age. And, as you say, I&rsquo;m &lsquo;plum growed up,&rsquo; and was a blessed long time ago. But I&rsquo;m
glad to see you, even if I can&rsquo;t remember you.&rdquo;
And she was. And so was the Major. Something alive and tangible had come to link
them with the happy past. The three sat and talked over the olden times, the Major and
Uncle Mose correcting or prompting each other as they reviewed the plantation scenes and
days.
The Major inquired what the old man was doing so far from his home.&ldquo;Uncle Mose am a delicate,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;to de grand Baptis&rsquo; convention in dis city. I
never preached none, but bein&rsquo; a residin&rsquo; elder in de church, and able fur to pay my own
expenses, dey sent me along.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And how did you know we were in Washington?&rdquo; inquired Miss Lydia.
&ldquo;Dey&rsquo;s a cullud man works in de hotel whar I stops, what comes from Mobile. He told
me he seen Mars&rsquo; Pendleton comin&rsquo; outen dish here house one mawnin&rsquo;.
&ldquo;What I come fur,&rdquo; continued Uncle Mose, reaching into his pocket&ndash;&ldquo;besides de sight of
home folks&ndash;was to pay Mars&rsquo; Pendleton what I owes him.
&ldquo;Yessir&ndash;three hundred dollars.&rdquo; He handed the Major a roll of bills. &ldquo;When I lef&rsquo; old
mars&rsquo; says: &lsquo;Take dem mule colts, Mose, and, if it be so you gits able, pay fur &lsquo;em.&rsquo;
Yessir&ndash;dem was his words. De war had done lef&rsquo; old mars&rsquo; po&rsquo; hisself. Old mars&rsquo; bein&rsquo; long
ago dead, de debt descends to Mars&rsquo; Pendleton. Three hundred dollars. Uncle Mose is
plenty able to pay now. When dat railroad buy my lan&rsquo; I laid off to pay fur dem mules. Count
de money, Mars&rsquo; Pendleton. Dat&rsquo;s what I sold dem mules fur. Yessir.&rdquo;
Tears were in Major Talbot&rsquo;s eyes. He took Uncle Mose&rsquo;s hand and laid his other upon
his shoulder.
&ldquo;Dear, faithful, old servitor,&rdquo; he said in an unsteady voice, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind saying to you
that &lsquo;Mars&rsquo; Pendleton spent his last dollar in the world a week ago. We will accept this
money, Uncle Mose, since, in a way, it is a sort of payment, as well as a token of the loyalty
and devotion of the old regime. Lydia, my dear, take the money. You are better fitted than I
to manage its expenditure.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Take it, honey,&rdquo; said Uncle Mose. &ldquo;Hit belongs to you. Hit&rsquo;s Talbot money.&rdquo;
After Uncle Mose had gone, Miss Lydia had a good cry&mdash;for joy; and the Major turned
his face to a corner, and smoked his clay pipe volcanically.
The succeeding days saw the Talbots restored to peace and ease. Miss Lydia&rsquo;s face lost
its worried look. The major appeared in a new frock coat, in which he looked like a wax
figure personifying the memory of his golden age. Another publisher who read the
manuscript of the Anecdotes and Reminiscences thought that, with a little retouching and
toning down of the high lights, he could make a really bright and salable volume of it.
Altogether, the situation was comfortable, and not without the touch of hope that is often
sweeter than arrived blessings.
One day, about a week after their piece of good luck, a maid brought a letter for Miss
Lydia to her room. The postmark showed that it was from New York. Not knowing any onethere, Miss Lydia, in a mild flutter of wonder, sat down by her table and opened the letter
with her scissors. This was what she read:
DEAR MISS TALBOT:
I thought you might be glad to learn of my good fortune. I have received and accepted
an offer of two hundred dollars per week by a New York stock company to play Colonel
Calhoun in A Magnolia Flower.
There is something else I wanted you to know. I guess you&rsquo;d better not tell Major Talbot.
I was anxious to make him some amends for the great help he was to me in studying the
part, and for the bad humor he was in about it. He refused to let me, so I did it anyhow. I
could easily spare the three hundred.
Sincerely yours,
H. HOPKINS HARGRAVES.
P.S. How did I play Uncle Mose?
Major Talbot, passing through the hall, saw Miss Lydia&rsquo;s door open and stopped.
&ldquo;Any mail for us this morning, Lydia, dear?&rdquo; he asked.
Miss Lydia slid the letter beneath a fold of her dress.
&ldquo;The Mobile Chronicle came,&rdquo; she said promptly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on the table in your study.&rdquo;
The Fifth Wheel （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The ranks of the Bed Line moved closer together; for it was cold. They were alluvial
deposit of the stream of life lodged in the delta of Fifth Avenue and Broadway. The Bed
Liners stamped their freezing feet, looked at the empty benches in Madison Square whence
Jack Frost had evicted them, and muttered to one another in a confusion of tongues. The
Flatiron Building, with its impious, cloud-piercing architecture looming mistily above them
on the opposite delta, might well have stood for the tower of Babel, whence these polyglot
idlers had been called by the winged walking delegate of the Lord.
Standing on a pine box a head higher than his flock of goats, the Preacher exhorted
whatever transient and shifting audience the north wind doled out to him. It was a slavemarket. Fifteen cents bought you a man. You deeded him to Morpheus; and the recording
angel gave you credit.
The preacher was incredibly earnest and unwearied. He had looked over the list of
things one may do for one&rsquo;s fellow man, and had assumed for himself the task of putting to
bed all who might apply at his soap box on the nights of Wednesday and Sunday. That left
but five nights for other philanthropists to handle; and had they done their part as well, this
wicked city might have become a vast Arcadian dormitory where all might snooze and snore
the happy hours away, letting problem plays and the rent man and business go to the deuce.
The hour of eight was but a little while past; sightseers in a small, dark mass of pay ore
were gathered in the shadow of General Worth&rsquo;s monument. Now and then, shyly,
ostentatiously, carelessly, or with conscientious exactness one would step forward and
bestow upon the Preacher small bills or silver. Then a lieutenant of Scandinavian coloring
and enthusiasm would march away to a lodging house with a squad of the redeemed. All the
while the Preacher exhorted the crowd in terms beautifully devoid of eloquence - splendid
with the deadly, accusative monotony of truth. Before the picture of the Bed Liners fades
you must hear one phrase of the Preacher&rsquo;s - the one that formed his theme that night. It is
worthy of being stenciled on all the white ribbons in the world.
&ldquo;No man ever learned to be a drunkard on five-cent whisky.&rdquo;
Think of it, tippler. It covers the ground from the sprouting rye to the Potter&rsquo;s Field.
A clean-profiled, erect young man in the rear rank of the bedless emulated the terrapin,
drawing his head far down into the shell of his coat collar. It was a well-cut tweed coat; and
the trousers still showed signs of having flattened themselves beneath the compelling goose.
But, conscientiously, I must warn the milliner&rsquo;s apprentice who reads this, expecting a
Reginald Montressor in straits, to peruse no further. The young man was no other than
Thomas McQuade, ex-coachman, discharged for drunkenness one month before, and now
reduced to the grimy ranks of the one-night bed seekers.
If you live in smaller New York you must know the Van Smuythe family carriage, drawn
by the two 1,500-pound, 100 to 1-shot bays. The carriage is shaped like a bath-tub. In each
end of it reclines an old lady Van Smuythe holding a black sunshade the size of a New Year&rsquo;s
Eve feather tickler. Before his downfall Thomas McQuade drove the Van Smuythe bays and
was himself driven by Annie, the Van Smuythe lady&rsquo;s maid. But it is one of the saddest things
about romance that a tight shoe or an empty commissary or an aching tooth will make a
temporary heretic of any Cupid-worshiper. And Thomas&rsquo;s physical troubles were not few.
Therefore, his soul was less vexed with thoughts of his lost lady&rsquo;s maid than it was by the
fancied presence of certain non-existent things that his racked nerves almost convinced him
were flying, dancing, crawling, and wriggling on the asphalt and in the air above and around
the dismal campus of the Bed Line army. Nearly four weeks of straight whisky and a diet
limited to crackers, bologna, and pickles often guarantees a psycho-zoological sequel. Thusdesperate, freezing, angry, beset by phantoms as he was, he felt the need of human
sympathy and intercourse.
The Bed Liner standing at his right was a young man of about his own age, shabby but
neat.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the diagnosis of your case, Freddy?&rdquo; asked Thomas, with the freemasonic
familiarity of the damned - &ldquo;Booze? That&rsquo;s mine. You don&rsquo;t look like a panhandler. Neither
am I. A month ago I was pushing the lines over the backs of the finest team of Percheron
buffaloes that ever made their mile down Fifth Avenue in 2.85. And look at me now! Say;
how do you come to be at this bed bargain-counter rummage sale.&rdquo;
The other young man seemed to welcome the advances of the airy ex-coachman.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;mine isn&rsquo;t exactly a case of drink. Unless we allow that Cupid is a
bartender. I married unwisely, according to the opinion of my unforgiving relatives. I&rsquo;ve been
out of work for a year because I don&rsquo;t know how to work; and I&rsquo;ve been sick in Bellevue and
other hospitals for months. My wife and kid had to go back to her mother. I was turned out
of the hospital yesterday. And I haven&rsquo;t a cent. That&rsquo;s my tale of woe.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tough luck,&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;A man alone can pull through all right. But I hate to see the
women and kids get the worst of it.&rdquo;
Just then there hummed up Fifth Avenue a motor car so splendid, so red, so smoothly
running, so craftily demolishing the speed regulations that it drew the attention even of the
listless Bed Liners. Suspended and pinioned on its left side was an extra tire.
When opposite the unfortunate company the fastenings of this tire became loosed. It
fell to the asphalt, bounded and rolled rapidly in the wake of the flying car.
Thomas McQuade, scenting an opportunity, darted from his place among the
Preacher&rsquo;s goats. In thirty seconds he had caught the rolling tire, swung it over his shoulder,
and was trotting smartly after the car. On both sides of the avenue people were shouting,
whistling, and waving canes at the red car, pointing to the enterprising Thomas coming up
with the lost tire.
One dollar, Thomas had estimated, was the smallest guerdon that so grand an
automobilist could offer for the service he had rendered, and save his pride.
Two blocks away the car had stopped. There was a little, brown, muffled chauffeur
driving, and an imposing gentleman wearing a magnificent sealskin coat and a silk hat on a
rear seat.Thomas proffered the captured tire with his best ex-coachman manner and a look in
the brighter of his reddened eyes that was meant to be suggestive to the extent of a silver
coin or two and receptive up to higher denominations.
But the look was not so construed. The sealskinned gentleman received the tire, placed
it inside the car, gazed intently at the ex-coachman, and muttered to himself inscrutable
words.
&ldquo;Strange - strange!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Once or twice even I, myself, have fancied that the
Chaldean Chiroscope has availed. Could it be possible?&rdquo;
Then he addressed less mysterious words to the waiting and hopeful Thomas.
&ldquo;Sir, I thank you for your kind rescue of my tire. And I would ask you, if I may, a question.
Do you know the family of Van Smuythes living in Washington Square North?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t I to?&rdquo; replied Thomas. &ldquo;I lived there. Wish I did yet.&rdquo;
The sealskinned gentleman opened a door of the car.
&ldquo;Step in please,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have been expected.&rdquo;
Thomas McQuade obeyed with surprise but without hesitation. A seat in a motor car
seemed better than standing room in the Bed Line. But after the lap-robe had been tucked
about him and the auto had sped on its course, the peculiarity of the invitation lingered in
his mind.
&ldquo;Maybe the guy hasn&rsquo;t got any change,&rdquo; was his diagnosis. &ldquo;Lots of these swell rounders
don&rsquo;t lug about any ready money. Guess he&rsquo;ll dump me out when he gets to some joint
where he can get cash on his mug. Anyhow, it&rsquo;s a cinch that I&rsquo;ve got that open-air bed
convention beat to a finish.&rdquo;
Submerged in his greatcoat, the mysterious automobilist seemed, himself, to marvel at
the surprises of life. &ldquo;Wonderful! amazing! strange!&rdquo; he repeated to himself constantly.
When the car had well entered the crosstown Seventies, it swung eastward a half block
and stopped before a row of high-stooped, brownstone-front houses.
&ldquo;Be kind enough to enter my house with me,&rdquo; said the sealskinned gentleman when
they had alighted. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to dig up, sure,&rdquo; reflected Thomas, following him inside.
There was a dim light in the hall. His host conducted him through a door to the left,
closing it after him and leaving them in absolute darkness. Suddenly a luminous globe,
strangely decorated, shone faintly in the centre of an immense room that seemed toThomas more splendidly appointed than any he had ever seen on the stage or read of in
fairy tales.
The walls were hidden by gorgeous red hangings embroidered with fantastic gold
figures. At the rear end of the room were draped porti`eres of dull gold spangled with silver
crescents and stars. The furniture was of the costliest and rarest styles. The ex-coachman&rsquo;s
feet sank into rugs as fleecy and deep as snowdrifts. There were three or four oddly shaped
stands or tables covered with black velvet drapery.
Thomas McQuade took in the splendors of this palatial apartment with one eye. With
the other he looked for his imposing conductor - to find that he had disappeared.
&ldquo;B&rsquo;gee!&rdquo; muttered Thomas, &ldquo;this listens like a spook shop. Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it ain&rsquo;t
one of these Moravian Nights&rsquo; adventures that you read about. Wonder what became of the
furry guy.&rdquo;
Suddenly a stuffed owl that stood on an ebony perch near the illuminated globe slowly
raised his wings and emitted from his eyes a brilliant electric glow.
With a fright-born imprecation, Thomas seized a bronze statuette of Hebe from a
cabinet near by and hurled it with all his might at the terrifying and impossible fowl. The owl
and his perch went over with a crash. With the sound there was a click, and the room was
flooded with light from a dozen frosted globes along the walls and ceiling. The gold portieres
parted and closed, and the mysterious automobilist entered the room. He was tall and wore
evening dress of perfect cut and accurate taste. A Vandyke beard of glossy, golden brown,
rather long and wavy hair, smoothly parted, and large, magnetic, orientally occult eyes gave
him a most impressive and striking appearance. If you can conceive a Russian Grand Duke in
a Rajah&rsquo;s throneroom advancing to greet a visiting Emperor, you will gather something of
the majesty of his manner. But Thomas McQuade was too near his d t&rsquo;s to be mindful of his
p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s. When he viewed this silken, polished, and somewhat terrifying host he thought
vaguely of dentists.
&ldquo;Say, doc,&rdquo; said he resentfully, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a hot bird you keep on tap. I hope I didn&rsquo;t break
anything. But I&rsquo;ve nearly got the williwalloos, and when he threw them
32-candle-power-lamps of his on me, I took a snap-shot at him with that little brass Flatiron
Girl that stood on the sideboard.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That is merely a mechanical toy,&rdquo; said the gentleman with a wave of his hand. &ldquo;May I
ask you to be seated while I explain why I brought you to my house. Perhaps you would not
understand nor be in sympathy with the psychological prompting that caused me to do so.
So I will come to the point at once by venturing to refer to your admission that you know the
Van Smuythe family, of Washington Square North.&ldquo;&ldquo;Any silver missing,&rdquo; asked Thomas tartly. &ldquo;Any joolry displaced? Of course I know &lsquo;em.
Any of the old ladies&rsquo; sunshades disappeared? Well, I know &lsquo;em. And then what?&rdquo;
The Grand Duke rubbed his white hands together softly.
&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Wonderful! Shall I come to believe in the Chaldean
Chiroscope myself? Let me assure you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that there is nothing for you to fear.
Instead, I think I can promise you that very good fortune awaits you. We will see.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do they want me back?&rdquo; asked Thomas, with something of his old professional pride in
his voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise to cut out the booze and do the right thing if they&rsquo;ll try me again. But
how did you get wise, doc? B&rsquo;gee, it&rsquo;s the swellest employment agency I was ever in, with its
flashlight owls and so forth.&rdquo;
With an indulgent smile the gracious host begged to be excused for two minutes. He
went out to the sidewalk and gave an order to the chauffeur, who still waited with the car.
Returning to the mysterious apartment, he sat by his guest and began to entertain him so
well by his witty and genial converse that the poor Bed Liner almost forgot the cold streets
from which he had been so recently and so singularly rescued. A servant brought some
tender cold fowl and tea biscuits and a glass of miraculous wine; and Thomas felt the
glamour of Arabia envelop him. Thus half an hour sped quickly; and then the honk of the
returned motor car at the door suddenly drew the Grand Duke to his feet, with another soft
petition for a brief absence.
Two women, well muffled against the cold, were admitted at the front door and suavely
conducted by the master of the house down the hall through another door to the left and
into a smaller room, which was screened and segregated from the larger front room by
heavy, double portieres. here the furnishings were even more elegant and exquisitely
tasteful than in the other. On a gold-inlaid rosewood table were scattered sheets of white
paper and a queer, triangular instrument or toy, apparently of gold, standing on little
wheels.
The taller woman threw back her black veil and loosened her cloak. She was fifty, with
a wrinkled and sad face. The other, young and plump, took a chair a little distance away and
to the rear as a servant or an attendant might have done.
&ldquo;You sent for me, Professor Cherubusco,&rdquo; said the elder woman, wearily. &ldquo;I hope you
have something more definite than usual to say. I&rsquo;ve about lost the little faith I had in your
art. I would not have responded to your call this evening if my sister had not insisted upon
it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the professor, with his princeliest smile, &ldquo;the true Art cannot fail. To find
the true psychic and potential branch sometimes requires time. We have not succeeded, I
admit, with the cards, the crystal, the stars, the magic formulae of Zarazin, nor the Oracle ofPo. But we have at last discovered the true psychic route. The Chaldean Chiroscope has been
successful in our search.&rdquo;
The professor&rsquo;s voice had a ring that seemed to proclaim his belief in his own words.
The elderly lady looked at him with a little more interest.
&ldquo;Why, there was no sense in those words that it wrote with my hands on it,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The words were these,&rdquo; said Professor Cherubusco, rising to his full magnificent height:
&ldquo;By the fifth wheel of the chariot he shall come.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen many chariots,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;but I never saw one with five wheels.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Progress,&rdquo; said the professor - &ldquo;progress in science and mechanics has accomplished it
- though, to be exact, we may speak of it only as an extra tire. Progress in occult art has
advanced in proportion. Madam, I repeat that the Chaldean Chiroscope has succeeded. I can
not only answer the question that you have propounded, but I can produce before your eyes
the proof thereof.&rdquo;
And now the lady was disturbed both in her disbelief and in her poise.
&ldquo;O professor!&rdquo; she cried anxiously - &ldquo;When? - where? Has he been found? Do not keep
me in suspense.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I beg you will excuse me for a very few minutes,&rdquo; said Professor Cherubusco, &ldquo;and I
think I can demonstrate to you the efficacy of the true Art.&rdquo;
Thomas was contentedly munching the last crumbs of the bread and fowl when the
enchanter appeared suddenly at his side.
&ldquo;Are you willing to return to your old home if you are assured of a welcome and
restoration to favor?&rdquo; he asked, with his courteous, royal smile.
&ldquo;Do I look bughouse?&rdquo; answered Thomas. &ldquo;Enough of the footback life for me. But will
they have me again? The old lady is as fixed in her ways as a nut on a new axle.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My dear young man,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;she has been searching for you everywhere.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the job. That team of dropsical domedaries they call
horses is a handicap for a first-class coachman like myself; but I&rsquo;ll take the job back, sure, doc.
They&rsquo;re good people to be with.&ldquo;And now a change came o&rsquo;er the suave countenance of the Caliph of Bagdad. He looked
keenly and suspiciously at the ex-coachman.
&ldquo;May I ask what your name is?&rdquo; he said shortly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been looking for me,&rdquo; said Thomas, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t know my name? You&rsquo;re a funny
kind of sleuth. You must be one of the Central Office gumshoers. I&rsquo;m Thomas McQuade, of
course; and I&rsquo;ve been chauffeur of the Van Smuythe elephant team for a year. They fired me
a month ago for - well, doc, you saw what I did to your old owl. I went broke on booze, and
when I saw the tire drop off your whiz wagon I was standing in that squad of hoboes at the
Worth monument waiting for a free bed. Now, what&rsquo;s the prize for the best answer to all
this?&rdquo;
To his intense surprise Thomas felt himself lifted by the collar and dragged, without a
word of explanation, to the front door. This was opened, and he was kicked forcibly down
the steps with one heavy, disillusionizing, humiliating impact of the stupendous Arabian&rsquo;s
shoe.
As soon as the ex-coachman had recovered his feet and his wits he hastened as fast as
he could eastward toward Broadway.
&ldquo;Crazy guy,&rdquo; was his estimate of the mysterious automobilist. &ldquo;Just wanted to have
some fun kiddin&rsquo;, I guess. He might have dug up a dollar, anyhow. Now I&rsquo;ve got to hurry up
and get back to that gang of bum bed hunters before they all get preached to sleep.&rdquo;
When Thomas reached the end of his two-mile walk he found the ranks of the
homeless reduced to a squad of perhaps eight or ten. He took the proper place of a
newcomer at the left end of the rear rank. In a file in front of him was the young man who
had spoken to him of hospitals and something of a wife and child.
&ldquo;Sorry to see you back again,&rdquo; said the young man, turning to speak to him. &ldquo;I hoped
you had struck something better than this.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;Oh, I just took a run around the block to keep warm! I see the
public ain&rsquo;t lending to the Lord very fast tonight.&rdquo;
&ldquo;In this kind of weather,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;charity avails itself of the proverb, and
both begins and ends at home.&rdquo;
And the Preacher and his vehement lieutenant struck up a last hymn of petition to
Providence and man. Those of the Bed Liners whose windpipes still registered above 32
degrees hopelessly and tunelessly joined in.In the middle of the second verse Thomas saw a sturdy girl with wind-tossed drapery
battling against the breeze and coming straight toward him from the opposite sidewalk.
&ldquo;Annie!&rdquo; he yelled, and ran toward her.
&ldquo;You fool, you fool!&rdquo; she cried, weeping and laughing, and hanging upon his neck, &ldquo;why
did you do it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Stuff,&rdquo; explained Thomas briefly. &ldquo;You know. But subsequently nit. Not a drop.&rdquo; He
led her to the curb. &ldquo;How did you happen to see me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I came to find you,&rdquo; said Annie, holding tight to his sleeve. &ldquo;Oh, you big fool! Professor
Cherubusco told us that we might find you here.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Professor Ch - Dont&rsquo; know the guy. What saloon does he work in?&rdquo;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a clairvoyant, Thomas; the greatest in the world. He found you with the Chaldean
telescope, he said.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a liar,&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;I never had it. He never saw me have anybody&rsquo;s telescope.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And he said you came in a chariot with five wheels or something.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Annie,&rdquo; said Thoms solicitously, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re giving me the wheels now. If I had a chariot I&rsquo;d
have gone to bed in it long ago. And without any singing and preaching for a nightcap,
either.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Listen, you big fool. The Missis says she&rsquo;ll take you back. I begged her to. But you must
behave. And you can go up to the house to-night; and your old room over the stable is
ready.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; said Thomas earnestly. &ldquo;You are It, Annie. But when did these stunts happen?&rdquo;
&ldquo;To-night at Professor Cherubusco&rsquo;s. He sent his automobile for the Missis, and she
took me along. I&rsquo;ve been there with her before.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the professor&rsquo;s line?&rdquo;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a clairvoyant and a witch. The Missis consults him. He knows everything. But he
hasn&rsquo;t done the Missis any good yet, though she&rsquo;s paid him hundreds of dollars. But he told
us that the stars told him we could find you here.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the old lady want this cherry-buster to do?&rdquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a family secret,&rdquo; said Annie. &ldquo;And now you&rsquo;ve asked enough questions. Come on
home, you big fool.&rdquo;
They had moved but a little way up the street when Thomas stopped.
&ldquo;Got any dough with you, Annie?&rdquo; he asked.
Annie looked at him sharply.
&ldquo;Oh, I know what that look means,&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong. Not another drop. But
there&rsquo;s a guy that was standing next to me in the bed line over there that&rsquo;s in bad shape.
He&rsquo;s the right kind, and he&rsquo;s got wives or kids or something, and he&rsquo;s on the sick list. No
booze. If you could dig up half a dollar for him so he could get a decent bed I&rsquo;d like it.&rdquo;
Annie&rsquo;s fingers began to wiggle in her purse.
&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ve got money,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Lots of it. Twelve dollars.&rdquo; And then she added, with
woman&rsquo;s ineradicable suspicion of vicarious benevolence: &ldquo;Bring him here and let me see
him first.&rdquo;
Thomas went on his mission. The wan Bed Liner came readily enough. As the two drew
near, Annie looked up from her purse and screamed:
&ldquo;Mr. Walter - Oh - Mr. Walter!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Is that you, Annie?&rdquo; said the young man meekly.
&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Walter! - and the Missis hunting high and low for you!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Does mother want to see me?&rdquo; he asked, with a flush coming out on his pale cheek.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been hunting for you high and low. Sure, she wants to see you. She wants you to
come home. She&rsquo;s tried police and morgues and lawyers and advertising and detectives and
rewards and everything. And then she took up clearvoyants. You&rsquo;ll go right home, won&rsquo;t you,
Mr. Walter?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Gladly, if she wants me,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;Three years is a long time. I suppose I&rsquo;ll
have to walk up, though, unless the street cars are giving free rides. I used to walk and beat
that old plug team of bays we used to drive to the carriage. Have they got them yet?&rdquo;
&ldquo;They have,&rdquo; said Thomas, feelingly. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll have &lsquo;em ten years from now. The life
of the royal elephantibus truckhorseibus is one hundred and forty-nine years. I&rsquo;m the
coachman. Just got my reappointment five minutes ago. Let&rsquo;s all ride up in a surface car -
that is - er - if Annie will pay the fares.&ldquo;On the Broadway car Annie handed each one of the prodigals a nickel to pay the
conductor.
&ldquo;Seems to me you are mighty reckless the way you throw large sums of money
around,&rdquo; said Thomas sarcastically.
&ldquo;In that purse,&rdquo; said Annie decidedly, &ldquo;is exactly $11.85. I shall take every cent of it
to-morrow and give it to professor Cherubusco, the greatest man in the world.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Thomas, &ldquo;I guess he must be a pretty fly guy to pipe off things the way he
does. I&rsquo;m glad his spooks told him where you could find me. If you&rsquo;ll give me his address,
some day I&rsquo;ll go up there, myself, and shake his hand.&rdquo;
Presently Thomas moved tentatively in his seat, and thoughtfully felt an abrasion or
two on his knees and his elbows.
&ldquo;Say, Annie,&rdquo; said he confidentially, maybe it&rsquo;s one of the last dreams of booze, but I&rsquo;ve
a kind of a recollection of riding in authomobile with a swell guy that took me to a house full
of eagles and arc lights. He fed me on biscuits and hot air, and then kicked me down the
front steps. If it was the d t&rsquo;s, why am I so sore?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shut up, you fool,&rdquo; said Annie.
&ldquo;If I could find that funny guy&rsquo;s house, said Thomas, in conclusion, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go up there
some day and punch his nose for him.&rdquo;
From the Cabby&rsquo;s Seat （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The cabby has his point of view. It is more single-minded, perhaps, than that of a
follower of any other calling. From the high, swaying seat of his hansom he looks upon his
fellow-men as nomadic particles, of no account except when possessed of migratory desires.
He is Jehu, and you are goods in transit. Be you President or vagabond, to cabby you are
only a Fare, he takes you up, cracks his whip, joggles your vertebrae and sets you down.
When time for payment arrives, if you exhibit a familiarity with legal rates you come to
know what contempt is; if you find that you have left your pocketbook behind you are made
to realise the mildness of Dante&rsquo;s imagination.It is not an extravagant theory that the cabby&rsquo;s singleness of purpose and concentrated
view of life are the results of the hansom&rsquo;s peculiar construction. The cock-of-the-roost sits
aloft like Jupiter on an unsharable seat, holding your fate between two thongs of inconstant
leather. Helpless, ridiculous, confined, bobbing like a toy mandarin, you sit like a rat in a
trap&ndash;you, before whom butlers cringe on solid land&ndash;and must squeak upward through a slit
in your peripatetic sarcophagus to make your feeble wishes known.
Then, in a cab, you are not even an occupant; you are contents. You are a cargo at sea,
and the &ldquo;cherub that sits up aloft&rdquo; has Davy Jones&rsquo;s street and number by heart.
One night there were sounds of revelry in the big brick tenement- house next door but
one to McGary&rsquo;s Family Cafe. The sounds seemed to emanate from the apartments of the
Walsh family. The sidewalk was obstructed by an assortment of interested neighbours, who
opened a lane from time to time for a hurrying messenger bearing from McGary&rsquo;s goods
pertinent to festivity and diversion. The sidewalk contingent was engaged in comment and
discussion from which it made no effort to eliminate the news that Norah Walsh was being
married.
In the fulness of time there was an eruption of the merry-makers to the sidewalk. The
uninvited guests enveloped and permeated them, and upon the night air rose joyous cries,
congratulations, laughter and unclassified noises born of McGary&rsquo;s oblations to the
hymeneal scene.
Close to the curb stood Jerry O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s cab. Night-hawk was Jerry called; but no
more lustrous or cleaner hansom than his ever closed its doors upon point lace and
November violets. And Jerry&rsquo;s horse! I am within bounds when I tell you that he was stuffed
with oats until one of those old ladies who leave their dishes unwashed at home and go
about having expressmen arrested, would have smiled&ndash;yes, smiled&ndash;to have seen him.
Among the shifting, sonorous, pulsing crowd glimpses could be had of Jerry&rsquo;s high hat,
battered by the winds and rains of many years; of his nose like a carrot, battered by the
frolicsome, athletic progeny of millionaires and by contumacious fares; of his brass-buttoned
green coat, admired in the vicinity of McGary&rsquo;s. It was plain that Jerry had usurped the
functions of his cab, and was carrying a &ldquo;load.&rdquo; Indeed, the figure may be extended and he
be likened to a bread-waggon if we admit the testimony of a youthful spectator, who was
heard to remark &ldquo;Jerry has got a bun.&rdquo;
From somewhere among the throng in the street or else out of the thin stream of
pedestrians a young woman tripped and stood by the cab. The professional hawk&rsquo;s eye of
Jerry caught the movement. He made a lurch for the cab, overturning three or four
onlookers and himself&ndash; no! he caught the cap of a water-plug and kept his feet. Like a sailor
shinning up the ratlins during a squall Jerry mounted to his professional seat. Once he was
there McGary&rsquo;s liquids were baffled. He seesawed on the mizzenmast of his craft as safe as a
Steeple Jack rigged to the flagpole of a skyscraper.&ldquo;Step in, lady,&rdquo; said Jerry, gathering his lines. The young woman stepped into the cab;
the doors shut with a bang; Jerry&rsquo;s whip cracked in the air; the crowd in the gutter scattered,
and the fine hansom dashed away &lsquo;crosstown.
When the oat-spry horse had hedged a little his first spurt of speed Jerry broke the lid
of his cab and called down through the aperture in the voice of a cracked megaphone, trying
to please:
&ldquo;Where, now, will ye be drivin&rsquo; to?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Anywhere you please,&rdquo; came up the answer, musical and contented.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis drivin&rsquo; for pleasure she is,&rdquo; thought Jerry. And then he suggested as a matter of
course:
&ldquo;Take a thrip around in the park, lady. &lsquo;Twill be ilegant cool and fine.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Just as you like,&rdquo; answered the fare, pleasantly.
The cab headed for Fifth avenue and sped up that perfect street. Jerry bounced and
swayed in his seat. The potent fluids of McGary were disquieted and they sent new fumes to
his head. He sang an ancient song of Killisnook and brandished his whip like a baton.
Inside the cab the fare sat up straight on the cushions, looking to right and left at the
lights and houses. Even in the shadowed hansom her eyes shone like stars at twilight.
When they reached Fifty-ninth street Jerry&rsquo;s head was bobbing and his reins were slack.
But his horse turned in through the park gate and began the old familiar nocturnal round.
And then the fare leaned back, entranced, and breathed deep the clean, wholesome odours
of grass and leaf and bloom. And the wise beast in the shafts, knowing his ground, struck
into his by-the-hour gait and kept to the right of the road.
Habit also struggled successfully against Jerry&rsquo;s increasing torpor. He raised the hatch of
his storm-tossed vessel and made the inquiry that cabbies do make in the park.
&ldquo;Like shtop at the Cas-sino, lady? Gezzer r&rsquo;freshm&rsquo;s, &lsquo;n lish&rsquo;n the music. Ev&rsquo;body shtops.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I think that would be nice,&rdquo; said the fare.
They reined up with a plunge at the Casino entrance. The cab doors flew open. The fare
stepped directly upon the floor. At once she was caught in a web of ravishing music and
dazzled by a panorama of lights and colours. Some one slipped a little square card into her
hand on which was printed a number&ndash;34. She looked around and saw her cab twenty yardsaway already lining up in its place among the waiting mass of carriages, cabs and motor cars.
And then a man who seemed to be all shirt-front danced backward before her; and next she
was seated at a little table by a railing over which climbed a jessamine vine.
There seemed to be a wordless invitation to purchase; she consulted a collection of
small coins in a thin purse, and received from them license to order a glass of beer. There
she sat, inhaling and absorbing it all&ndash;the new-coloured, new-shaped life in a fairy palace in
an enchanted wood.
At fifty tables sat princes and queens clad in all the silks and gems of the world. And
now and then one of them would look curiously at Jerry&rsquo;s fare. They saw a plain figure
dressed in a pink silk of the kind that is tempered by the word &ldquo;foulard,&rdquo; and a plain face
that wore a look of love of life that the queens envied.
Twice the long hands of the clocks went round, Royalties thinned from their al fresco
thrones, and buzzed or clattered away in their vehicles of state. The music retired into cases
of wood and bags of leather and baize. Waiters removed cloths pointedly near the plain
figure sitting almost alone.
Jerry&rsquo;s fare rose, and held out her numbered card simply:
&ldquo;Is there anything coming on the ticket?&rdquo; she asked. A waiter told her it was her cab
check, and that she should give it to the man at the entrance. This man took it, and called
the number. Only three hansoms stood in line. The driver of one of them went and routed
out Jerry asleep in his cab. He swore deeply, climbed to the captain&rsquo;s bridge and steered his
craft to the pier. His fare entered, and the cab whirled into the cool fastnesses of the park
along the shortest homeward cuts.
At the gate a glimmer of reason in the form of sudden suspicion seized upon Jerry&rsquo;s
beclouded mind. One or two things occurred to him. He stopped his horse, raised the trap
and dropped his phonographic voice, like a lead plummet, through the aperture:
&ldquo;I want to see four dollars before goin&rsquo; any further on th&rsquo; thrip. Have ye got th&rsquo; dough?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Four dollars!&rdquo; laughed the fare, softly, &ldquo;dear me, no. I&rsquo;ve only got a few pennies and a
dime or two.&rdquo;
Jerry shut down the trap and slashed his oat-fed horse. The clatter of hoofs strangled
but could not drown the sound of his profanity. He shouted choking and gurgling curses at
the starry heavens; he cut viciously with his whip at passing vehicles; he scattered fierce and
ever-changing oaths and imprecations along the streets, so that a late truck driver, crawling
homeward, heard and was abashed. But he knew his recourse, and made for it at a gallop.At the house with the green lights beside the steps he pulled up. He flung wide the cab
doors and tumbled heavily to the ground.
&ldquo;Come on, you,&rdquo; he said, roughly.
His fare came forth with the Casino dreamy smile still on her plain face. Jerry took her
by the arm and led her into the police station. A gray-moustached sergeant looked keenly
across the desk. He and the cabby were no strangers.
&ldquo;Sargeant,&rdquo; began Jerry in his old raucous, martyred, thunderous tones of complaint.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a fare here that&ndash;&rdquo;
Jerry paused. He drew a knotted, red hand across his brow. The fog set up by McGary
was beginning to clear away.
&ldquo;A fare, sargeant,&rdquo; he continued, with a grin, &ldquo;that I want to inthroduce to ye. It&rsquo;s me
wife that I married at ould man Walsh&rsquo;s this avening. And a divil of a time we had, ‘tis thrue.
Shake hands wid th&rsquo; sargeant, Norah, and we&rsquo;ll be off to home.&rdquo;
Before stepping into the cab Norah sighed profoundly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had such a nice time, Jerry,&rdquo; said she.
The Furnished Room （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Restless, shifting, fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of the population of the
red brick district of the lower West Side. Homeless, they have a hundred homes. They flit
from furnished room to furnished room, transients forever&ndash;transients in abode, transients in
heart and mind. They sing &ldquo;Home, Sweet Home&rdquo; in ragtime; they carry their lares et penates
in a bandbox; their vine is entwined about a picture hat; a rubber plant is their fig tree.
Hence the houses of this district, having had a thousand dwellers, should have a
thousand tales to tell, mostly dull ones, no doubt; but it would be strange if there could not
be found a ghost or two in the wake of all these vagrant guests.
One evening after dark a young man prowled among these crumbling red mansions,
ringing their bells. At the twelfth he rested his lean hand-baggage upon the step and wiped
the dust from his hatband and forehead. The bell sounded faint and far away in some
remote, hollow depths.To the door of this, the twelfth house whose bell he had rung, came a housekeeper
who made him think of an unwholesome, surfeited worm that had eaten its nut to a hollow
shell and now sought to fill the vacancy with edible lodgers.
He asked if there was a room to let.
&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the housekeeper. Her voice came from her throat; her throat seemed
lined with fur. &ldquo;I have the third floor back, vacant since a week back. Should you wish to look
at it?&rdquo;
The young man followed her up the stairs. A faint light from no particular source
mitigated the shadows of the halls. They trod noiselessly upon a stair carpet that its own
loom would have forsworn. It seemed to have become vegetable; to have degenerated in
that rank, sunless air to lush lichen or spreading moss that grew in patches to the staircase
and was viscid under the foot like organic matter. At each turn of the stairs were vacant
niches in the wall. Perhaps plants had once been set within them. If so they had died in that
foul and tainted air. It may be that statues of the saints had stood there, but it was not
difficult to conceive that imps and devils had dragged them forth in the darkness and down
to the unholy depths of some furnished pit below.
&ldquo;This is the room,&rdquo; said the housekeeper, from her furry throat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice room. It ain&rsquo;t
often vacant. I had some most elegant people in it last summer&ndash;no trouble at all, and paid in
advance to the minute. The water&rsquo;s at the end of the hall. Sprowls and Mooney kept it three
months. They done a vaudeville sketch. Miss B&rsquo;retta Sprowls&ndash;you may have heard of her&ndash;Oh,
that was just the stage names &ndash;right there over the dresser is where the marriage certificate
hung, framed. The gas is here, and you see there is plenty of closet room. It&rsquo;s a room
everybody likes. It never stays idle long.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do you have many theatrical people rooming here?&rdquo; asked the young man.
&ldquo;They comes and goes. A good proportion of my lodgers is connected with the theatres.
Yes, sir, this is the theatrical district. Actor people never stays long anywhere. I get my share.
Yes, they comes and they goes.&rdquo;
He engaged the room, paying for a week in advance. He was tired, he said, and would
take possession at once. He counted out the money. The room had been made ready, she
said, even to towels and water. As the housekeeper moved away he put, for the thousandth
time, the question that he carried at the end of his tongue.
&ldquo;A young girl&ndash;Miss Vashner&ndash;Miss Eloise Vashner&ndash;do you remember such a one among
your lodgers? She would be singing on the stage, most likely. A fair girl, of medium height
and slender, with reddish, gold hair and a dark mole near her left eyebrow.&ldquo;&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t remember the name. Them stage people has names they change as often
as their rooms. They comes and they goes. No, I don&rsquo;t call that one to mind.&rdquo;
No. Always no. Five months of ceaseless interrogation and the inevitable negative. So
much time spent by day in questioning managers, agents, schools and choruses; by night
among the audiences of theatres from all-star casts down to music halls so low that he
dreaded to find what he most hoped for. He who had loved her best had tried to find her. He
was sure that since her disappearance from home this great, water-girt city held her
somewhere, but it was like a monstrous quicksand, shifting its particles constantly, with no
foundation, its upper granules of to-day buried to-morrow in ooze and slime.
The furnished room received its latest guest with a first glow of pseudo-hospitality, a
hectic, haggard, perfunctory welcome like the specious smile of a demirep. The sophistical
comfort came in reflected gleams from the decayed furniture, the raggcd brocade
upholstery of a couch and two chairs, a footwide cheap pier glass between the two windows,
from one or two gilt picture frames and a brass bedstead in a corner.
The guest reclined, inert, upon a chair, while the room, confused in speech as though it
were an apartment in Babel, tried to discourse to him of its divers tenantry.
A polychromatic rug like some brilliant-flowered rectangular, tropical islet lay
surrounded by a billowy sea of soiled matting. Upon the gay-papered wall were those
pictures that pursue the homeless one from house to house&ndash;The Huguenot Lovers, The First
Quarrel, The Wedding Breakfast, Psyche at the Fountain. The mantel&rsquo;s chastely severe
outline was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn rakishly askew like the
sashes of the Amazonian ballet. Upon it was some desolate flotsam cast aside by the room&rsquo;s
marooned when a lucky sail had borne them to a fresh port&ndash;a trifling vase or two, pictures
of actresses, a medicine bottle, some stray cards out of a deck.
One by one, as the characters of a cryptograph become explicit, the little signs left by
the furnished room&rsquo;s procession of guests developed a significance. The threadbare space in
the rug in front of the dresser told that lovely woman had marched in the throng. Tiny finger
prints on the wall spoke of little prisoners trying to feel their way to sun and air. A splattered
stain, raying like the shadow of a bursting bomb, witnessed where a hurled glass or bottle
had splintered with its contents against the wall. Across the pier glass had been scrawled
with a diamond in staggering letters the name &ldquo;Marie.&rdquo; It seemed that the succession of
dwellers in the furnished room had turned in fury&ndash;perhaps tempted beyond forbearance by
its garish coldness&ndash;and wreaked upon it their passions. The furniture was chipped and
bruised; the couch, distorted by bursting springs, seemed a horrible monster that had been
slain during the stress of some grotesque convulsion. Some more potent upheaval had
cloven a great slice from the marble mantel. Each plank in the floor owned its particular cant
and shriek as from a separate and individual agony. It seemed incredible that all this malice
and injury had been wrought upon the room by those who had called it for a time theirhome; and yet it may have been the cheated home instinct surviving blindly, the resentful
rage at false household gods that had kindled their wrath. A hut that is our own we can
sweep and adorn and cherish.
The young tenant in the chair allowed these thoughts to file, soft- shod, through his
mind, while there drifted into the room furnished sounds and furnished scents. He heard in
one room a tittering and incontinent, slack laughter; in others the monologue of a scold, the
rattling of dice, a lullaby, and one crying dully; above him a banjo tinkled with spirit. Doors
banged somewhere; the elevated trains roared intermittently; a cat yowled miserably upon
a back fence. And he breathed the breath of the house&ndash;a dank savour rather than a smell
&ndash;a cold, musty effluvium as from underground vaults mingled with the reeking exhalations
of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork.
Then, suddenly, as he rested there, the room was filled with the strong, sweet odour of
mignonette. It came as upon a single buffet of wind with such sureness and fragrance and
emphasis that it almost seemed a living visitant. And the man cried aloud: &ldquo;What, dear?&rdquo; as
if he had been called, and sprang up and faced about. The rich odour clung to him and
wrapped him around. He reached out his arms for it, all his senses for the time confused and
commingled. How could one be peremptorily called by an odour? Surely it must have been a
sound. But, was it not the sound that had touched, that had caressed him?
&ldquo;She has been in this room,&rdquo; he cried, and he sprang to wrest from it a token, for he
knew he would recognize the smallest thing that had belonged to her or that she had
touched. This enveloping scent of mignonette, the odour that she had loved and made her
own&ndash;whence came it?
The room had been but carelessly set in order. Scattered upon the flimsy dresser scarf
were half a dozen hairpins&ndash;those discreet, indistinguishable friends of womankind, feminine
of gender, infinite of mood and uncommunicative of tense. These he ignored, conscious of
their triumphant lack of identity. Ransacking the drawers of the dresser he came upon a
discarded, tiny, ragged handkerchief. He pressed it to his face. It was racy and insolent with
heliotrope; he hurled it to the floor. In another drawer he found odd buttons, a theatre
programme, a pawnbroker&rsquo;s card, two lost marshmallows, a book on the divination of
dreams. In the last was a woman&rsquo;s black satin hair bow, which halted him, poised between
ice and fire. But the black satin hairbow also is femininity&rsquo;s demure, impersonal, common
ornament, and tells no tales.
And then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent, skimming the walls,
considering the corners of the bulging matting on his hands and knees, rummaging mantel
and tables, the curtains and hangngs, the drunken cabinet in the corner, for a visible sign,
unable to perceive that she was there beside, around, against, within, above him, clinging to
him, wooing him, calling him so poignantly through the finer senses that even his grosser
ones became cognisant of the call. Once again he answered loudly: &ldquo;Yes, dear!&rdquo; and turned,
wild-eyed, to gaze on vacancy, for he could not yet discern form and colour and love andoutstretched arms in the odour of mnignonette. Oh, God! whence that odour, and since
when have odours had a voice to call? Thus he groped.
He burrowed in crevices and corners, and found corks and cigarettes. These he passed
in passive contempt. But once he found in a fold of the matting a half-smoked cigar, and this
he ground beneath his heel with a green and trenchant oath. He sifted the room from end to
end. He found dreary and ignoble small records of many a peripatetic tenant; but of her
whom he sought, and who may have lodged there, and whose spirit seemed to hover there,
he found no trace.
And then he thought of the housekeeper.
He ran from the haunted room downstairs and to a door that showed a crack of light.
She came out to his knock. He smothered his excitement as best he could.
&ldquo;Will you tell me, madam,&rdquo; he besought her, &ldquo;who occupied the room I have before I
came?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, sir. I can tell you again. &lsquo;Twas Sprowls and Mooney, as I said. Miss B&rsquo;retta Sprowls
it was in the theatres, but Missis Mooney she was. My house is well known for respectability.
The marriage certificate hung, framed, on a nail over&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;What kind of a lady was Miss Sprowls&ndash;in looks, I mean?&rdquo;
Why, black-haired, sir, short, and stout, with a comical face. They left a week ago
Tuesday.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And before they occupied it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, there was a single gentleman connected with the draying business. He left owing
me a week. Before him was Missis Crowder and her two children, that stayed four months;
and back of them was old Mr. Doyle, whose sons paid for him. He kept the room six months.
That goes back a year, sir, and further I do not remember.&rdquo;
He thanked her and crept back to his room. The room was dead. The essence that had
vivified it was gone. The perfume of mignonette had departed. In its place was the old, stale
odour of mouldy house furniture, of atmosphere in storage.
The ebbing of his hope drained his faith. He sat staring at the yellow, singing gaslight.
Soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the sheets into strips. With the blade of his
knife he drove them tightly into every crevice around windows and door. When all was snug
and taut he turned out the light, turned the gas full on again and laid himself gratefully upon
the bed.* * * * * * *
It was Mrs. McCool&rsquo;s night to go with the can for beer. So she fetched it and sat with
Mrs. Purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where house-keepers foregather and the
worm dieth seldom.
&ldquo;I rented out my third floor, back, this evening,&rdquo; said Mrs. Purdy, across a fine circle of
foam. &ldquo;A young man took it. He went up to bed two hours ago.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Now, did ye, Mrs. Purdy, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; said Mrs. McCool, with intense admiration. &ldquo;You do
be a wonder for rentin&rsquo; rooms of that kind. And did ye tell him, then?&rdquo; she concluded in a
husky whisper, laden with mystery.
&ldquo;Rooms,&rdquo; said Mrs. Purdy, in her furriest tones, &ldquo;are furnished for to rent. I did not tell
him, Mrs. McCool.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis right ye are, ma&rsquo;am; &lsquo;tis by renting rooms we kape alive. Ye have the rale sense for
business, ma&rsquo;am. There be many people will rayjict the rentin&rsquo; of a room if they be tould a
suicide has been after dyin&rsquo; in the bed of it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;As you say, we has our living to be making,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Purdy.
&ldquo;Yis, ma&rsquo;am; &lsquo;tis true. &lsquo;Tis just one wake ago this day I helped ye lay out the third floor,
back. A pretty slip of a colleen she was to be killin&rsquo; herself wid the gas&ndash;a swate little face she
had, Mrs. Purdy, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;d a-been called handsome, as you say,&rdquo; said Mrs. Purdy, assenting but critical, &ldquo;but
for that mole she had a-growin&rsquo; by her left eyebrow. Do fill up your glass again, Mrs.
McCool.&rdquo;
Georgia&rsquo;s Ruling （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>If you should chance to visit the General Land Office, step into the draughtsmen&rsquo;s room
and ask to be shown the map of Salado County. A leisurely German &ndash; pos- sibly old Kampfer
himself &ndash; will bring it to you. It will be four feet square, on heavy drawing-cloth. The
lettering and the figures will be beautifully clear and distinct. The title will be in splendid,
undecipherable German text, ornamented with classic Teutonic designs &ndash; very likely Ceres
or Pomona leaning against the initial letters with cornucopias venting grapes and wieners.
You must tell him that this is not the map you wish to see; that he will kindly bring you itsofficial predecessor. He will then say, &ldquo;Ach, so!&rdquo; and bring out a map half the size of the first,
dim, old, tattered, and faded.
By looking carefully near its northwest corner you will presently come upon the worn
contours of Chiquito River, and, maybe, if your eyes are good, discern the silent witness to
this story.
The Commissioner of the Land Office was of the old style; his antique courtesy was too
formal for his day. He dressed in fine black, and there was a suggestion of Roman drapery in
his long coat-skirts. His collars were &ldquo;undetached&rdquo; (blame haberdashery for the word); his
tie was a narrow, funereal strip, tied in the same knot as were his shoe-strings. His gray hair
was a trifle too long behind, but he kept it smooth and orderly. His face was clean-shaven,
like the old statesmen&rsquo;s. Most people thought it a stern face, but when its official expression
was off, a few had seen altogether a different countenance. Especially tender and gentle it
had appeared to those who were about him during the last illness of his only child.
The Commissioner had been a widower for years, and his life, outside his official duties,
had been so devoted to little Georgia that people spoke of it as a touching and admirable
thing. He was a reserved man, and dignified almost to austerity, but the child had come
below it all and rested upon his very heart, so that she scarcely missed the mother&rsquo;s love
that had been taken away. There was a wonderful companionship between them, for she
had many of his own ways, being thoughtful and serious beyond her years.
One day, while she was lying with the fever burning brightly in her checks, she said
suddenly:
&ldquo;Papa, I wish I could do something good for a whole lot of children!&rdquo;
&ldquo;What would you like to do, dear?&rdquo; asked the Com- Missioner. &ldquo;Give them a party?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean those kind. I mean poor children who haven&rsquo;t homes, and aren&rsquo;t
loved and cared for as I am. I tell you what, papa!&rdquo;
&ldquo;What, my own child?&rdquo;
&ldquo;If I shouldn&rsquo;t get well, I&rsquo;ll leave them you &ndash; not give you, but just lend you, for you
must come to mamma and me when you die too. If you can find time, wouldn&rsquo;t you do
something to help them, if I ask you, papa?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hush, hush dear, dear child,&rdquo; said the Commissioner, holding her hot little hand
against his cheek; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll get well real soon, and you and I will see what we can do for them
together.&ldquo;But in whatsoever paths of benevolence, thus vaguely premeditated, the Commissioner
might tread, he was not to have the company of his beloved. That night the little frail body
grew suddenly too tired to struggle further, and Georgia&rsquo;s exit was made from the great
stage when she had scarcely begun to speak her little piece before the footlights. But there
must be a stage manager who understands. She had given the cue to the one who was to
speak after her.
A week after she was laid away, the Commissioner reappeared at the office, a little
more courteous, a little paler and sterner, with the black frock-coat hanging a little more
loosely from his tall figure.
His desk was piled with work that had accumulated during the four heartbreaking
weeks of his absence. His chief clerk had done what he could, but there were ques- tions of
law, of fine judicial decisions to be made concern- ing the issue of patents, the marketing
and leasing of school lands, the classification into grazing, agricultural, watered, and
timbered, of new tracts to be opened to settlers.
The Commissioner went to work silently and ob- stinately, putting back his grief as far
as possible, forcing his mind to attack the complicated and important busi- ness of his office.
On the second day after his return he called the porter, pointed to a leather-covered chair
that stood near his own, and ordered it removed to a lumber- room at the top of the
building. In that chair Georgia would always sit when she came to the office for him of
afternoons.
As time passed, the Commissioner seemed to grow more silent, solitary, and reserved.
A new phase of mind developed in him. He could not endure the presence of a child. Often
when a clattering youngster belonging to one of the clerks would come chattering into the
big business-room adjoining his little apartment, the Com- missioner would steal softly and
close the door. He would always cross the street to avoid meeting the school- children when
they came dancing along in happy groups upon the sidewalk, and his firm mouth would
close into a mere line.
It was nearly three months after the rains had washed the last dead flower-petals from
the mound above little Georgia when the &ldquo;land-shark&rdquo; firm of Hamlin and Avery filed papers
upon what they considered the &ldquo;fattest&rdquo; vacancy of the year.
It should not be supposed that all who were termed &ldquo;land-sharks&rdquo; deserved the name.
Many of them were reputable men of good business character. Some of them could walk
into the most august councils of the State and say: &ldquo;Gentlemen, we would like to have this,
and that, and matters go thus.&rdquo; But, next to a three years&rsquo; drought and the boll-worm, the
Actual Settler hated the Land-shark. The land-shark haunted the Land Office, where all the
land records were kept, and hunted &ldquo;vacancies&rdquo; &ndash; that is, tracts of unappro- priated public
domain, generally invisible upon the official maps, but actually existing &ldquo;upon the ground.&rdquo;
The law entitled any one possessing certain State scrip to file by virtue of same upon anyland not previously legally appropriated. Most of the scrip was now in the hands of the
land-sharks. Thus, at the cost of a few hundred dollars, they often secured lands worth as
many thousands. Naturally, the search for &ldquo;vacancies&rdquo; was lively.
But often &ndash; very often &ndash; the land they thus secured, though legally &ldquo;unappropriated,&rdquo;
would be occupied by happy and contented settlers, who had laboured for years to build up
their homes, only to discover that their titles were worthless, and to receive peremptory
notice to quit. Thus came about the bitter and not unjustifiable hatred felt by the toiling
settlers toward the shrewd and seldom merciful speculators who so often turned them forth
destitute and homeless from their fruitless labours. The history of the state teems with their
antagonism. Mr. Land-shark seldom showed his face on &ldquo;locations&rdquo; from which he should
have to eject the unfortunate victims of a monstrously tangled land system, but let his emissaxies do the work. There was lead in every cabin, moulded into balls for him; many of his
brothers had enriched the grass with their blood. The fault of it all lay far back.
When the state was young, she felt the need of attract- ing newcomers, and of
rewarding those pioneers already within her borders. Year after year she issued land scrip &ndash;
Headrights, Bounties, Veteran Donations, Confeder- ates; and to railroads, irrigation
companies, colonies, and tillers of the soil galore. All required of the grantee was that he or
it should have the scrip properly surveyed upon the public domain by the county or district
surveyor, and the land thus appropriated became the property of him or it, or his or its heirs
and assigns, forever.
In those days &ndash; and here is where the trouble began - the state&rsquo;s domain was practically
inexhaustible, and the old surveyors, with princely &ndash; yea, even Western American &ndash;
liberality, gave good measure and over- flowing. Often the jovial man of metes and bounds
would dispense altogether with the tripod and chain. Mounted on a pony that could cover
something near a &ldquo;vara&rdquo; at a step, with a pocket compass to direct his course, he would trot
out a survey by counting the beat of his pony&rsquo;s hoofs, mark his corners, and write out his
field notes with the complacency produced by an act of duty well performed. Sometimes &ndash;
and who could blame the surveyor? &ndash; when the pony was &ldquo;feeling his oats,&rdquo; he might step a
little higher and farther, and in that case the beneficiary of the scrip might get a thousand or
two more acres in his survey than the scrip called for. But look at the boundless leagues the
state had to spare! However, no one ever had to complain of the pony under- stepping.
Nearly every old survey in the state con- tained an excess of land.
In later years, when the state became more populous, and land values increased, this
careless work entailed incalculable trouble, endless litigation, a period of riotous
land-grabbing, and no little bloodshed. The land- sharks voraciously attacked these excesses
in the old surveys, and filed upon such portions with new scrip as unappropriated public
domain. Wherever the identi- fications of the old tracts were vague, and the corners were
not to be clearly established, the Land Office would recognize the newer locations as valid,
and issue title to the locators. Here was the greatest hardship to be found. These old surveys,
taken from the pick of the land, were already nearly all occupied by unsuspecting andpeaceful settlers, and thus their titles were demolished, and the choice was placed before
them either to buy their land over at a double price or to vacate it, with their families and
personal belongings, immediately. Land locators sprang up by hundreds. The country was
held up and searched for &ldquo;vacancies&rdquo; at the point of a compass. Hundreds of thousands of
dollars&rsquo; worth of splendid acres were wrested from their innocent purchasers and holders.
There began a vast hegira of evicted settlers in tattered wagons; going nowhere, cursing
injustice, stunned, purposeless, homeless, hopeless. Their children began to look up to them
for bread, and cry.
It was in consequence of these conditions that Hamil- ton and Avery had filed upon a
strip of land about a mile wide and three miles long, comprising about two thou- sand acres,
it being the excess over complement of the Elias Denny three-league survey on Chiquito
River, in one of the middle-western counties. This two-thousand- acre body of land was
asserted by them to be vacant land, and improperly considered a part of the Denny survey.
They based this assertion and their claim upon the land upon the demonstrated facts that
the beginning corner of the Denny survey was plainly identified; that its field notes called to
run west 5,760 varas, and then called for Chiquito River; thence it ran south, with the
meanders &ndash; and so on &ndash; and that the Chiquito River was, on the ground, fully a mile farther
west from the point reached by course and distance. To sum up: there were two thousand
acres of vacant land between the Denny survey proper and Chiquito River.
One sweltering day in July the Commissioner called for the papers in connection with
this new location. They were brought, and heaped, a foot deep, upon his desk &ndash; field notes,
statements, sketches, affidavits, connecting lines-documents of every description that
shrewdness and money could call to the aid of Hamlin and Avery.
The firm was pressing the Commissioner to issue a patent upon their location. They
possesed inside infor- mation concerning a new railroad that would probably pass
somewhere near this land.
The General Land Office was very still while the Com- missioner was delving into the
heart of the mass of evi- dence. The pigeons could be heard on the roof of the old,
castle-like building, cooing and fretting. The clerks were droning everywhere, scarcely
pretending to earn their salaries. Each little sound echoed hollow and loud from the bare,
stone-flagged floors, the plastered walls, and the iron-joisted ceiling. The impalpable,
perpetual lime- stone dust that never settled, whitened a long streamer of sunlight that
pierced the tattered window-awning.
It seemed that Hamlin and Avery had builded well. The Denny survey was carelessly
made, even for a care- less period. Its beginning corner was identical with that of a
well-defined old Spanish grant, but its other calls were sinfully vague. The field notes
contained no other object that survived &ndash; no tree, no natural object save Chiquito River, and
it was a mile wrong there. According to precedent, the Office would be justified in giving itits complement by course and distance, and considering the remainder vacant instead of a
mere excess.
The Actual Settler was besieging the office with wild protests in re. Having the nose of a
pointer and the eye of a hawk for the land-shark, he had observed his myrmi- dons running
the lines upon his ground. Making inquiries, he learned that the spoiler had attacked his
home, and he left the plough in the furrow and took his pen in hand.
One of the protests the Commissioner read twice. It was from a woman, a widow, the
granddaughter of Elias Denny himself. She told how her grandfather had sold most of the
survey years before at a trivial price &ndash; land that was now a principality in extent and value.
Her mother had also sold a part, and she herself had suc- ceeded to this western portion,
along Chiquito River. Much of it she had been forced to part with in order to live, and now
she owned only about three hundred acres, on which she had her home. Her letter wound
up rather pathetically:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got eight children, the oldest fifteen years. I work all day and half the night to till
what little land I can and keep us in clothes and books. I teach my children too. My
neighbours is all poor and has big families. The drought kills the crops every two or three
years and then we has hard times to get enough to eat. There is ten families on this land
what the land-sharks is trying to rob us of, and all of them got titles from me. I sold to them
cheap, and they aint paid out yet, but part of them is, and if their land should be took from
them I would die. My grandfather was an honest man, and he helped to build up this state,
and he taught his children to be honest, and how could I make it up to them who bought me?
Mr. Commissioner, if you let them land-sharks take the roof from over my children and the
little from them as they has to live on, whoever again calls this state great or its government
just will have a lie in their mouths&rdquo;
The Commissioner laid this letter aside with a sigh. Many, many such letters he had
received. He had never been hurt by them, nor had he ever felt that they appealed to him
personally. He was but the state&rsquo;s servant, and must follow its laws. And yet, somehow, this
reflection did not always eliminate a certain responsible feeling that hung upon him. Of all
the state&rsquo;s officers he was supremest in his department, not even excepting the Governor.
Broad, general land laws he followed, it was true, but he had a wide latitude in particular
ramifica- tions. Rather than law, what he followed was Rulings: Office Rulings and
precedents. In the complicated and new questions that were being engendered by the
state&rsquo;s development the Commissioner&rsquo;s ruling was rarely appealed from. Even the courts
sustained it when its equity was apparent.
The Commissioner stepped to the door and spoke to a clerk in the other room &ndash; spoke
as he always did, as if he were addressing a prince of the blood:
&ldquo;Mr. Weldon, will you be kind enough to ask Mr. Ashe, the state school-land appraiser,
to please come to my office as soon as convenient?&ldquo;Ashe came quickly from the big table where he was arranging his reports.
&ldquo;Mr. Ashe,&rdquo; said the Commissioner, &ldquo;you worked along the Chiquito River, in Salado
Colinty, during your last trip, I believe. Do you remember anything of the Elias Denny
three-league survey?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, sir, I do,&rdquo; the blunt, breezy, surveyor answered. &ldquo;I crossed it on my way to Block H,
on the north side of it. The road runs with the Chiquito River, along the valley. The Denny
survey fronts three miles on the Chiquito.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is claimed,&rdquo; continued the commissioner, &ldquo;that it fails to reach the river by as much
as a mile.&rdquo;
The appraiser shrugged his shoulder. He was by birth and instinct an Actual Settler, and
the natural foe of the land-shark.
&ldquo;It has always been considered to extend to the river,&rdquo; he said, dryly.
&ldquo;But that is not the point I desired to discuss,&rdquo; said the Commissioner. &ldquo;What kind of
country is this valley portion of (let us say, then) the Denny tract?&rdquo;
The spirit of the Actual Settler beamed in Ashe&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; he said, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Valley as level as this floor, with just a little swell
on, like the sea, and rich as cream. Just enough brakes to shelter the cattle in winter. Black
loamy soil for six feet, and then clay. Holds water. A dozen nice little houses on it, with
windmills and gardens. People pretty poor, I guess &ndash; too far from market &ndash; but comfortable.
Never saw so many kids in my life.&rdquo;
&ldquo;They raise flocks?&rdquo; inquired the Commissioner.
&ldquo;Ho, ho! I mean two-legged kids,&rdquo; lauched the surveyor; &ldquo;two-legged, and bare-legged,
and tow-headed.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Children! oh, children!&rdquo; mused the Commissioner, as though a new view had opened
to him; &ldquo;they raise children!
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lonesome country, Commissioner,&rdquo; said the surveyor. &ldquo;Can you blame &lsquo;em?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; continued the Commissioner, slowly, as one carefully pursues deductions
from a new, stupendous theory, &ldquo;not all of them are tow-headed. It would not be
unreasonable, Mr. Ashe, I conjecture, to believe that a portion of them have brown, or even
black, hair.&ldquo;&ldquo;Brown and black, sure,&rdquo; said Ashe; &ldquo;also red.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said the Commissioner. &ldquo;Well, I thank you for your courtesy in informing
me, Mr. Ashe. I will not detain you any longer from your duties.&rdquo;
Later, in the afternoon, came Hamlin and Avery, big, handsome, genial, sauntering men,
clothed in white duck and low-cut shoes. They permeated the whole office with an aura of
debonair prosperity. They passed among the clerks and left a wake of abbreviated given
names and fat brown cigars.
These were the aristocracy of the land-sharks, who went in for big things. Full of serene
confidence in them- selves, there was no corporation, no syndicate, no rail- road company or
attorney general too big for them to tackle. The peculiar smoke of their rare, fat brown
cigars was to be perceived in the sanctum of every department of state, in every
committee-room of the Legislature, in every bank parlour and every private caucus-room in
the state Capital. Always pleasant, never in a hurry, in seeming to possess unlimited leisure,
people wondered when they gave their attention to the many audacious enterprises in
which they were knnown to be engaged.
By and by the two dropped carelessly into the Com- missioner&rsquo;s room and reclined
lazily in the big, leather- upholstered arm-chairs. They drawled a good-natured complaint of
the weather, and Hamlin told the Com- missioner an excellent story he had amassed that
morn- ing from the Secretary of State.
But the Commissioner knew why they were there. He had half promised to render a
decision that day upon their location.
The chief clerk now brought in a batch of duplicate certificates for the Commissioner to
sign. As he traced his sprawling signature, &ldquo;Hollis Summerfield, Comr. Genl. Land Office,&rdquo; on
each one, the chief clerk stood, deftly removing them and applying the blotter.
&ldquo;I notice,&rdquo; said the chief clerk, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been going through that Salado County location.
Kampfer is mak- ing a new map of Salado, and I believe is platting in that section of the
county now.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I will see it,&rdquo; said the Comissioner. A few moments later he went to the draughtsmen&rsquo;s
room.
As he entered he saw five or six of the draughtsmen grouped about Kampfer&rsquo;s desk,
gargling away at each other in pectoral German, and gazing at something there- upon. At the
Commissioner&rsquo;s approach they scattered to their several places. Kampfer, a wizened little
Ger- man, with long, frizzled ringlets and a watery eye, began to stammer forth some sort of
an apology, the Commis- sioner thought, for the congregation of his fellows about his desk.&ldquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said the Commissioner, &ldquo;I wish to see the map you are making&rdquo;; and,
passing around the old German, seated himself upon the high draughtsman&rsquo;s stool. Kampfer
continued to break English in trving to explain.
&ldquo;Herr Gommissioner, I assure you blenty sat I haf not it bremeditated &ndash; sat it wass &ndash; sat
it itself make. Look you! from se field notes wass it blatted &ndash; blease to observe se calls:
South, 10 degrees west 050 varas; south, 10 degrees east 300 varas; south, 100; south, 9
west, 200; south, 40 degrees west 400 &ndash; and so on. Herr Gommissioner, nefer would I have
&ndash; &ldquo;
The Commissioner raised one white hand, silently, Kampfer dropped his pipe and fled.
With a hand at each side of his face, and his elbows resting upon the desk, the
Commissioner sat staring at the map which was spread and fastened there &ndash; staring at the
sweet and living profile of little Georgia drawn thereupon &ndash; at her face, pensive, delicate,
and infantile, outlined in a perfect likeness.
When his mind at length came to inquire into the rea- son of it, he saw that it must
have been, as Kampfer had said, unpremeditated. The old draughtsman had been platting in
the Elias Denny survey, and Georgia&rsquo;s likeness, striking though it was, was formed by nothing
more than the meanders of Chiquito River. Indeed, Kampfer&rsquo;s blotter, whereon his
preliminary work was done, showed the laborious tracings of the calls and the countless
pricks of the compasses. Then, over his faint pencilling, Kampfer had drawn in India ink with
a full, firm pen the similitude of Chiquito River, and forth had blossomed mysteriously the
dainty, pathetic profile of the child.
The Commissioner sat for half an hour with his face in his hands, gazing downward, and
none dared approach him. Then he arose and walked out. In the business office he paused
long enough to ask that the Denny file be brought to his desk.
He found Hamlin and Avery still reclining in their chairs, apparently oblivious of
business. They were lazily discussing summer opera, it being, their habit &ndash; perhaps their
pride also &ndash; to appear supernaturally indifferent whenever they stood with large interests
imperilled. And they stood to win more on this stake than most people knew. They
possessed inside infor- mation to the effect that a new railroad would, within a year, split
this very Chiquito River valley and send land values ballooning all along its route. A dollar
under thirty thousand profit on this location, if it should hold good, would be a loss to their
expectations. So, while they chatted lightly and waited for the Commissioner to open the
subject, there was a quick, sidelong sparkle in their eyes, evincing a desire to read their title
clear to those fair acres on the Chiquito.
A clerk brought in the file. The Commissioner seated himself and wrote upon it in red
ink. Then he rose to his feet and stood for a while looking straight out of the window. TheLand Office capped the summit of a bold hill. The eyes of the Commissioner passed over the
roofs of many houses set in a packing of deep green, the whole checkered by strips of
blinding white streets. The horizon, where his gaze was focussed, swelled to a fair wooded
eminence flecked with faint dots of shining white. There was the cemetery, where lay many
who were forgot- ten, and a few who had not lived in vain. And one lay there, occupying
very small space, whose childish heart had been large enough to desire, while near its last
beats, good to others. The Commissioner&rsquo;s lips moved slightly as he whispered to himself: &ldquo;It
was her last will and testament, and I have neglected it so long!&rdquo;
The big brown cigars of Hamlin and Avery were fireless, but they still gripped them
between their teeth and waited, while they marvelled at the absent expression upon the
Commissioner&rsquo;s face.
By and by he spoke suddenly and promptly.
&ldquo;Gentlemen, I have just indorsed the Elias Denny survey for patenting. This office will
not regard your location upon a part of it as legal.&rdquo; He paused a moment, and then,
extending his hand as those dear old-time ones used to do in debate, he enunciated the
spirit of that Ruling that subsequently drove the land-sharks to the wall, and placed the seal
of peace and security over the doors of ten thousand homes.
&ldquo;And, furthermore,&rdquo; he continued, with a clear, soft light upon his face, &ldquo;it may interest
you to know that from this time on this office will consider that when a survey of land made
by virtue of a certificate granted by this state to the men who wrested it from the wilderness
and the savage &ndash; made in good faith, settled in good faith, and left in good faith to their
children or innocent pur- chasers &ndash; when such a survey, although overrunning its
complement, shall call for any natural object visible to the eye of man, to that object it shall
hold, and be good and valid. And the children of this state shall lie down to sleep at night,
and rumours of disturbers of title shall not disquiet them. For,&rdquo; concluded the Commissioner,
&ldquo;of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo;
In the silence that followed, a laugh floated up from the patent-room below. The man
who carried down the Denny file was exhibiting it among the clerks.
&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, delightedly, &ldquo;the old man has forgotten his name. He&rsquo;s written
&lsquo;Patent to original grantee,&rsquo; and signed it &lsquo;Georgia Summerfield, Comr.&ldquo;&rsquo;
The speech of the Commissioner rebounded lightly from the impregnable Hamlin and
Avery. They smiled, rose gracefully, spoke of the baseball team, and argued feelingly that
quite a perceptible breeze had Arisen from the east. They lit fresh fat brown cigars, and
drifted courteously away. But later they made another tiger- spring for their quarry in the
courts. But the courts, according to reports in the papers, &ldquo;coolly roasted them&rdquo; (a
remarkable performance, suggestive of liquid-air didoes), and sustained the Commissioner&rsquo;s
Ruling.And this Ruling itself grew to be a Precedent, and the Actual Settler framed it, and
taught his children to spell from it, and there was sound sleep o&rsquo; nights from the pines to the
sage-brush, and from the chaparral to the great brown river of the north.
But I think, and I am sure the Commissioner never thought otherwise, that whether
Kampfer was a snuffy old instrument of destiny, or whether the meanders of the Chiquito
accidentally platted themselves into that memo- rable sweet profile or not, there was
brought about &ldquo;some- thing good for a whole lot of children,&rdquo; and the result ought to be
called &ldquo;Georgia&rsquo;s Ruling.&rdquo;
The Gift of the Magi （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies.
Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and
the butcher until one&rsquo;s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such
close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty- seven cents. And
the next day would be Christmas.
There was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So
Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and
smiles, with sniffles predominating.
While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second,
take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description,
but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.
In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric
button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a
card bearing the name &ldquo;Mr. James Dillingham Young.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;Dillingham&rdquo; had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity
when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20,
though, they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But
whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called
&ldquo;Jim&rdquo; and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as
Della. Which is all very good.
Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by
the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard.Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present.
She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a
week doesn&rsquo;t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are.
Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for
something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling&ndash;something just a little bit near
to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.
There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a
pierglass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a
rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della,
being slender, had mastered the art.
Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. her eyes were
shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled
down her hair and let it fall to its full length.
Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both
took a mighty pride. One was Jim&rsquo;s gold watch that had been his father&rsquo;s and his
grandfather&rsquo;s. The other was Della&rsquo;s hair. Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the
airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to
depreciate Her Majesty&rsquo;s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his
treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he
passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.
So now Della&rsquo;s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown
waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she
did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a
tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.
On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and
with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to
the street.
Where she stopped the sign read: &ldquo;Mne. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds.&rdquo; One flight
up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked
the &ldquo;Sofronie.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Will you buy my hair?&rdquo; asked Della.
&ldquo;I buy hair,&rdquo; said Madame. &ldquo;Take yer hat off and let&rsquo;s have a sight at the looks of it.&rdquo;
Down rippled the brown cascade.
&ldquo;Twenty dollars,&rdquo; said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.&ldquo;Give it to me quick,&rdquo; said Della.
Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She
was ransacking the stores for Jim&rsquo;s present.
She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no
other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum
fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and
not by meretricious ornamentation&ndash;as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The
Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim&rsquo;s. It was like him. Quietness and
value&ndash;the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she
hurried home with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious
about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the
sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.
When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason.
She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages
made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends&ndash;a
mammoth task.
Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her
look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long,
carefully, and critically.
&ldquo;If Jim doesn&rsquo;t kill me,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;before he takes a second look at me, he&rsquo;ll
say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do&ndash;oh! what could I do with a
dollar and eighty- seven cents?&rdquo;
At 7 o&rsquo;clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot
and ready to cook the chops.
Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the
table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down
on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit for saying little
silent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: &ldquo;Please God,
make him think I am still pretty.&rdquo;
The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious.
Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two&ndash;and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new
overcoat and he was without gloves.
Jim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes
were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and itterrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the
sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar
expression on his face.
Della wriggled off the table and went for him.
&ldquo;Jim, darling,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold
because I couldn&rsquo;t have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It&rsquo;ll grow out
again&ndash;you won&rsquo;t mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say `Merry
Christmas!&rsquo; Jim, and let&rsquo;s be happy. You don&rsquo;t know what a nice&ndash; what a beautiful, nice gift
I&rsquo;ve got for you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve cut off your hair?&rdquo; asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent
fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.
&ldquo;Cut it off and sold it,&rdquo; said Della. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like me just as well, anyhow? I&rsquo;m me
without my hair, ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
Jim looked about the room curiously.
&ldquo;You say your hair is gone?&rdquo; he said, with an air almost of idiocy.
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t look for it,&rdquo; said Della. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sold, I tell you&ndash;sold and gone, too. It&rsquo;s
Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were
numbered,&rdquo; she went on with sudden serious sweetness, &ldquo;but nobody could ever count my
love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?&rdquo;
Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let
us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight
dollars a week or a million a year&ndash;what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would
give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them.
This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.
Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make any mistake, Dell,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;about me. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything in the
way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if
you&rsquo;ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first.&rdquo;
White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of
joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the
immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.For there lay The Combs&ndash;the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped
long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rims&ndash;just the
shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her
heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And
now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments
were gone.
But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim
eyes and a smile and say: &ldquo;My hair grows so fast, Jim!&rdquo;
And them Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo;
Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open
palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent
spirit.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You&rsquo;ll have to look at the time a
hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it.&rdquo;
Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back
of his head and smiled.
&ldquo;Dell,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s put our Christmas presents away and keep &lsquo;em a while. They&rsquo;re
too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And
now suppose you put the chops on.&rdquo;
The magi, as you know, were wise men&ndash;wonderfully wise men&ndash;who brought gifts to
the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their
gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of
duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish
children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their
house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts
these two were the wisest. O all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest.
Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.
The Girl And The Graft （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The other day I ran across my old friend Ferguson Pogue. Pogue is a conscientious
grafter of the highest type. His headquarters is the Western Hemisphere, and his line ofbusiness is anything from speculating in town lots on the Great Staked Plains to selling
wooden toys in Connecticut, made by hydraulic pressure from nutmegs ground to a pulp.
Now and then when Pogue has made a good haul he comes to New York for a rest. He
says the jug of wine and loaf of bread and Thou in the wilderness business is about as much
rest and pleasure to him as sliding down the bumps at Coney would be to President Taft.
&ldquo;Give me,&rdquo; says Pogue, &ldquo;a big city for my vacation. Especially New York. I&rsquo;m not much fond of
New Yorkers, and Manhattan is about the only place on the globe where I don&rsquo;t find any.&rdquo;
While in the metropolis Pogue can always be found at one of two places. One is a little
second-hand bookshop on Fourth Avenue, where he reads books about his hobbies,
Mahometanism and taxidermy. I found him at the other - his hall bedroom in Eighteenth
Street - where he sat in his stocking feet trying to pluck &ldquo;The Banks of the Wabash&rdquo; out of a
small zither. Four years he has practised this tune without arriving near enough to cast the
longest trout line to the water&rsquo;s edge. On the dresser lay a blued-steel Colt&rsquo;s forty-five and a
tight roll of tens and twenties large enough around to belong to the spring rattlesnake-story
class. A chambermaid with a room-cleaning air fluttered nearby in the hall, unable to enter
or to flee, scandalized by the stocking feet, aghast at the Colt&rsquo;s, yet powerless, with her
metropolitan instincts, to remove herself beyond the magic influence of the yellow-hued
roll.
I sat on his trunk while Ferguson Pogue talked. No one could be franker or more candid
in his conversation. Beside his expression the cry of Henry James for lacteal nourishment at
the age of one month would have seemed like a Chaldean cryptogram. He told me stories of
his profession with pride, for he considered it an art. And I was curious enough to ask him
whether he had known any women who followed it.
&ldquo;Ladies?&rdquo; said Pogue, with Western chivalry. &ldquo;Well, not to any great extent. They don&rsquo;t
amount to much in special lines of graft, because they&rsquo;re all so busy in general lines. What?
Why, they have to. Who&rsquo;s got the money in the world? The men. Did you ever know a man
to give a woman a dollar without any consideration? A man will shell out his dust to another
man free and easy and gratis. But if he drops a penny in one of the machines run by the
Madam Eve&rsquo;s Daughters&rsquo; Amalgamated Association and the pineapple chewing gum don&rsquo;t
fall out when he pulls the lever you can hear him kick to the superintendent four blocks
away. Man is the hardest proposition a woman has to go up against. He&rsquo;s the low-grade one,
and she has to work overtime to make him pay. Two times out of five she&rsquo;s salted. She can&rsquo;t
put in crushers and costly machinery. He&rsquo;d notice &lsquo;em and be onto the game. They have to
pan out what they get, and it hurts their tender hands. Some of &lsquo;em are natural sluice
troughs and can carry out $1,000 to the ton. The dry-eyed ones have to depend on signed
letters, false hair, sympathy, the kangaroo walk, cowhide whips, ability to cook, sentimental
juries, conversational powers, silk underskirts, ancestry, rouge, anonymous letters, violet
sachet powders, witnesses, revolvers, pneumatic forms, carbolic acid, moonlight, cold cream
and the evening newspapers.&ldquo;&ldquo;You are outrageous, Ferg,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Surely there is none of this &lsquo;graft&rsquo; as you call it, in a
perfect and harmonious matrimonial union!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Pogue, &ldquo;nothing that would justify you every time in calling Police
Headquarters and ordering out the reserves and a vaudeville manager on a dead run. But it&rsquo;s
this way: Suppose you&rsquo;re a Fifth Avenue millionaire, soaring high, on the right side of copper
and cappers.
&ldquo;You come home at night and bring a $9,000,000 diamond brooch to the lady who&rsquo;s
staked your for a claim. You hand it over. She says, &lsquo;Oh, George!&rsquo; and looks to see if it&rsquo;s
backed. She comes up and kisses you. You&rsquo;ve waited for it. You get it. All right. It&rsquo;s graft.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m telling you about Artemisia Blye. She was from Kansas and she suggested corn
in all of its phases. Her hair was as yellow as the silk; her form was as tall and graceful as a
stalk in the low grounds during a wet summer; her eyes were as big and startling as bunions,
and green was her favorite color.
&ldquo;On my last trip into the cool recesses of your sequestered city I met a human named
Vaucross. He was worth - that is, he had a million. He told me he was in business on the
street. &lsquo;A sidewalk merchant?&rsquo; says I, sarcastic. &lsquo;Exactly,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;Senior partner of a paving
concern.&rsquo;
&ldquo;I kind of took to him. For this reason, I met him on Broadway one night when I was out
of heart, luck, tobacco and place. He was all silk hat, diamonds and front. He was all front. If
you had gone behind him you would have only looked yourself in the face. I looked like a
cross between Count Tolstoy and a June lobster. I was out of luck. I had - but let me lay my
eyes on that dealer again.
&ldquo;Vaucross stopped and talked to me a few minutes and then he took me to a
high-toned restaurant to eat dinner. There was music, and then some Beethoven, and
Bordelaise sauce, and cussing in French, and frangipangi, and some hauteur and cigarettes.
When I am flush I know them places.
&ldquo;I declare, I must have looked as bad as a magazine artist sitting there without any
money and my hair all rumpled like I was booked to read a chapter from &lsquo;Elsie&rsquo;s School Days&rsquo;
at a Brooklyn Bohemian smoker. But Vaucross treated me like a bear hunter&rsquo;s guide. He
wasn&rsquo;t afraid of hurting the waiter&rsquo;s feelings.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Pogue,&rsquo; he explains to me, &lsquo;I am using you.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t wake up.&rsquo;
&ldquo;And then he tells me, you know, the kind of man he was. He was a New Yorker. His
whole ambition was to be noticed. He wanted to be conspicuous. He wanted people to pointhim out and bow to him, and tell others who he was. He said it had been the desire of his
life always. He didn&rsquo;t have but a million, so he couldn&rsquo;t attract attention by spending money.
He said he tried to get into public notice one time by planting a little public square on the
east side with garlic for free use of the poor; but Carnegie heard of it, and covered it over at
once with a library in the Gaelic language. Three times he had jumped in the way of
automibiles; but the only result was five broken ribs and a notice in the papers that an
unknown man, five feet ten, with four amalgam-filled teeth, supposed to be the last of the
famous Red Leary gang had been run over.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Ever try the reporters,&rsquo; I asked him.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Last month,&rsquo; says Mr. Vaucross, &lsquo;my expenditure for lunches to reporters was
$124.80.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Get anything out of that?&rsquo; I asks.
&ldquo;&lsquo;That reminds me,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;add $8.50 for perpsin. Yes, I got indigestion.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;How am I supposed to push along your scramble for prominence?&rsquo; I inquires.
&lsquo;Contrast?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Something of that sort to-night,&rsquo; says Vaucross. &lsquo;It grieves me; but I am forced to
resort to eccentricity.&rsquo; And here he drops his napkin in his soup and rises up and bows to a
gent who is devastating a potato under a palm across the room.
&ldquo;&lsquo;The Police Commissioner,&rsquo; says my climber, gratified. &lsquo;Friend&rsquo;, says I, in a hurry, &lsquo;have
ambitions but don&rsquo;t kick a rung out of your ladder. When you use me as a stepping stone to
salute the police you spoil my appetite on the grounds that I may be degraded and
incriminated. Be thoughtful.&rsquo;
&ldquo;At the Quaker City squab en casserole the idea about Artemisia Blye comes to me.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Suppose I can manage to get you in the papers,&rsquo; says I - &lsquo;a column or two every day in
all of &lsquo;em and your picture in most of &lsquo;em for a week. How much would it be worth to you?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Ten thousand dollars,&rsquo; says Vaucross, warm in a minute. &lsquo;But no murder,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;and
I won&rsquo;t wear pink pants at a cotillon.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t ask you to,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;This is honorable, stylish and uneffiminate. Tell the
waiter to bring a demi tasse and some other beans, and I will disclose to you the opus
moderandi.&rsquo;
&ldquo;We closed the deal an hour later in the rococo rouge et noise room. I telegraphed that
night to Miss Artemisia in Salina. She took a couple of photographs and an autograph letterto an elder in the Fourth Presbyterian Church in the morning, and got some transportation
and $80. She stopped in Topeka long enough to trade a flashlight interior and a valentine to
the vice-president of a trust company for a mileage book and a package of five-dollar notes
with $250 scrawled on the band.
&ldquo;The fifth evening after she got my wire she was waiting, all decolletee and dressed up,
for me and Vaucross to take her to dinner in one of these New York feminine apartment
houses where a man can&rsquo;t get in unless he plays bezique and smokes depilatory powder
cigarettes.
&ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s a stunner,&rsquo; says Vaucross when he saw her. &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll give her a two-column cut
sure.&rsquo;
&ldquo;This was the scheme the three of us concocted. It was business straight through.
Vaucross was to rush Miss Blye with all the style and display and emotion he could for a
month. Of course, that amounted to nothing as far as his ambitions were concerned. The
sight of a man in a white tie and patent leather pumps pouring greenbacks through the large
end of a cornucopia to purchase nutriment and heartsease for tall, willowy blondes in New
York is as common a sight as blue turtles in delirium tremens. But he was to write her love
letters - the worst kind of love letters, such as your wife publishes after you are dead - every
day. At the end of the month he was to drop her, and she would bring suit for $100,000 for
breach of promise.
&ldquo;Miss Artemisia was to get $10,000. If she won the suit that was all; and if she lost she
was to get it anyhow. There was a signed contract to that effect.
&ldquo;Sometimes they had me out with &lsquo;em, but not often. I couldn&rsquo;t keep up to their style.
She used to pull out his notes and criticize them like bills of lading.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Say, you!&rsquo; she&rsquo;d say. &lsquo;What do you call this - letter to a Hardware Merchant from His
Nephew on Learning that His Aunt Has Nettlerash? You Eastern duffers know as much about
writing love letters as a Kansas grasshopper does about tugboats. &ldquo;My dear Miss Blye!&rdquo; -
wouldn&rsquo;t that put pink icing and a little red sugar bird on your bridal cake? How long do you
expect to hold an audience in a court-room with that kind of stuff? You want to get down to
business, and call me &ldquo;Tweedlums Babe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Honeysuckle,&rdquo; and sing yourself &ldquo;Mama&rsquo;s
Own Big Bad Puggy Wuggy Boy&rdquo; if you want any limelight to concentrate upon your sparse
gray hairs. Get sappy.&rsquo;
&ldquo;After that Vaucross dipped his pen in the indelible tabasco. His notes read like
something or other in the original. I could see a jury sitting up, and women tearing one
another&rsquo;s hats to hear &lsquo;em read. And I could see piling up for Mr. Vaucross as much
notoriousness as Archbishop Crammer or the Brooklyn Bridge or cheese-on-salad ever
enjoyed. He seemed mighty pleased at the prospects.&ldquo;They agreed on a night; and I stood on Fifth Avenue outside a solemn restaurant and
watched &lsquo;em. A process-server walked in and handed Vaucross the papers at this table.
Everybody looked at &lsquo;em; and he looked as proud as Cicero. I went back to my room and lit a
five-cent cigar, for I knew the $10,000 was as good as ours.
&ldquo;About two hours later somebody knocked at my door. There stood Vaucross and Miss
Artemisia, and she was clinging - yes, sir, clinging - to his arm. And they tells me they&rsquo;d been
out and got married. And they articulated some trivial cadences about love and such. And
they laid down a bundle on the table and said &lsquo;Good night&rsquo; and left.
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why I say,&rdquo; concluded Ferguson Pogue, &ldquo;that a woman is too busy occupied
with her natural vocation and instinct of graft such as is given her for self-preservation and
amusement to make any great success in special lines.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What was in the bundle they left?&rdquo; I asked, with my usual curiosity.
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Ferguson, &ldquo;there was a scalper&rsquo;s railroad ticket as far as Kansas City and
two pairs of Mr. Vaucross&rsquo;s old pants.&rdquo;
The Girl And The Habit （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>HABIT - a tendency or aptitude acquired by custom or frequent repitition.
The critics have assailed every source of inspiration save one. To that one we are driven
for our moral theme. When we levied upon the masters of old they gleefully dug up the
parallels to our columns. When we strove to set forth real life they reproached us for trying
to imitate Henry George, George Washington, Washington Irving, and Irving Bacheller. We
wrote of the West and the East, and they accused us of both Jesse and Henry James. We
wrote from our heart - and they said something about a disordered liver. We took a text
from Matthew or - er-yes, Deuteronomy, but the preachers were hammering away at the
inspiration idea before we could get into type. So, driven to the wall, we go for our
subject-matter to the reliable, old, moral, unassailable vade mecum - the unabridged
dictionary.
Miss Merriam was cashier at Hinkle&rsquo;s. Hinkle&rsquo;s is one of the big downtown restaurants.
It is in what the papers call the &ldquo;financial district.&rdquo; Each day from 12 o&rsquo;clock to 2 Hinkle&rsquo;s was
full of hungry customers - messenger boys, stenographers, brokers, owners of mining stock,
promoters, inventors with patents pending - and also people with money.The cashiership at Hinkle&rsquo;s was no sinecure. Hinkle egged and toasted and
griddle-caked and coffeed a good many customers; and he lunched (as good a word as
&ldquo;dined&rdquo;) many more. It might be said that Hinkle&rsquo;s breakfast crowd was a contingent, but his
luncheon patronage amounted to a horde.
Miss Merriam sat on a stool at a desk inclosed on three sides by a strong, high fencing
of woven brass wire. Through an arched opening at the bottom you thrust your waiter&rsquo;s
check and the money, while your heart went pit-pat.
For Miss Merriam was lovely and capable. She could take 45 cents out of a $2 bill and
refuse an offer of marriage before you could - Next! - lost your chance - please don&rsquo;t shove.
She could keep cool and collected while she collected your check, give you the correct
change, win your heart, indicate the toothpick stand, and rate you to a quarter of a cent
better than Bradstreet could to a thousand in less time than it takes to pepper an egg with
one of Hinkle&rsquo;s casters. There is an old and dignified allusion to the &ldquo;fierce light that beats
upon a throne.&rdquo; The light that beats upon the young lady cashier&rsquo;s cage is also something
fierce. The other fellow is responsible for the slang.
Every male patron of Hinkle&rsquo;s, from A. D. T. boys up to the curbstone brokers, adored
Miss Merriam. When they paid their checks they wooed her with every wile known to
Cupid&rsquo;s art. Between the meshes of the brass railing went smiles, winks, compliments,
tender vows, invitations to dinner, sighs, languishing looks and merry banter that was
wafted pointedly back by the gifted Miss Merriam.
There is no coign of vantage more effective than the position of young lady cashier. She
sits there, easily queen of the court of commerce; she is duchess of dollars and devoirs,
countess of compliment; and coin, leading lady of love and luncheon. You take from her a
smile and a Canadian dime, and you go your way uncomplaining. You count the cheery word
or two that she tosses you as misers count their treasures; and you pocket the change for a
five uncomputed. Perhaps the brass-bound inaccessibility multiplies her charms - anyhow,
she is a shirt-waisted angel, immaculate, trim, manicured, seductive, bright-eyed, ready,
alert - Psyche, Circe, and Ate in one, separating you from your circulating medium after your
sirloin medium.
The young men who broke bread at Hinkle&rsquo;s never settled with the cashier without an
exchange of badinage and open compliment. Many of them went to greater lengths and
dropped promissory hints of theatre tickets and chocolate. The older spoke plainly of orange
blossoms, generally withering the tentative petals by after-allusions to Harlem flats. One
broker, who had been squeezed by copper proposed to Miss Merriam more regularly than
he ate.
During a brisk luncheon hour Miss Merriam&rsquo;s conversation, while she took money for
checks, would run something like this:&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Haskins - sir? - it&rsquo;s natural, thank you - don&rsquo;t be quite so fresh &hellip;
Hello, Johnny - ten, fifteen, twenty - chase along now or they&rsquo;ll take the letters off your cap &hellip;
Beg pardon - count it again, please - Oh, don&rsquo;t mention it &hellip; Vaudeville? - thanks; not on your
moving picture - I was to see Carter in Hedda Gabler on Wednesday night with Mr.
Simmons &hellip; &lsquo;Scuse me, I thought that was a quarter &hellip; Twenty-five and seventy-five&rsquo;s a dollar
- got that ham-and-cabbage habit yet. I see, Billy &hellip; Who are you addressing? - say - you&rsquo;ll
get all that&rsquo;s coming to you in a minute &hellip; Oh, fudge! Mr. Bassett - you&rsquo;re always fooling - no
- ? Well, maybe I&rsquo;ll marry you some day - three, four and sixty-five is five &hellip; Kindly keep them
remarks to yourself, if you please &hellip; Ten cents? - &lsquo;scuse me; the check calls for seventy - well,
maybe it is a one instead of a seven &hellip; Oh, do you like it that way, Mr. Saunders? - some
prefer a pomp; but they say this Cleo de Merody does suit refined features &hellip; and ten is
fifty &hellip; Hike along there, buddy; don&rsquo;t take this for a Coney Island ticket booth &hellip; Huh? - why,
Macy&rsquo;s - don&rsquo;t it fit nice? Oh, no, it isn&rsquo;t too cool - these light-weight fabrics is all the go this
season &hellip; Come again, please - that&rsquo;s the third time you&rsquo;ve tried to - what? - forget it - that
lead quarter is an old friend of mine &hellip; Sixty-five? - must have had your salary raised, Mr.
Wilson &hellip; I seen you on Sixth Avenue Tuesday afternoon, Mr. De Forest - swell? - oh, my! -
who is she? &hellip; What&rsquo;s the matter with it? - why, this ain&rsquo;t South America &hellip; Yes, I like the
mixed best - Friday? - awfully sorry, but I take my jiu-jitsu lesson on Friday - Thursday, then &hellip;
Thanks - that&rsquo;s sixteen times I&rsquo;ve been told that this morning - I guess I must be beautiful &hellip;
Cut that out, please - who do you think I am? &hellip; Why, Mr. Westbrook - do you really think so?
- the idea! - one - eighty and twenty&rsquo;s a dollar - thank you ever so much, but I don&rsquo;t ever go
automobile riding with gentlemen - your aunt? - well, that&rsquo;s different - perhaps &hellip; Please
don&rsquo;t get fresh - your check was fifteen cents, I believe - kindly step aside and let &hellip; Hello,
Ben - coming around Thursday evening? - there&rsquo;s a gentleman going to send around a box of
chocolates, and &hellip; forty and sixty is a dollar, and one is two &hellip;&rdquo;
About the middle of one afternoon the dizzy goddess Vertigo - whose other name is
Fortune - suddenly smote an old, wealthy and eccentric banker while he was walking past
Hinkle&rsquo;s, on his way to a street car. A wealthy and eccentric banker who rides in street cars is
- move up, please; there are others.
A Samaritan, A Pharisee, a man and a policeman who were first on the spot lifter
Banker McRamsey and carried him into Hinkle&rsquo;s restaurant. When the aged but
indestructible banker opened his eyes he saw a beautikful vision bending over him with a
pitiful, tender smile, bathing his forehead with beef tea and chafing his hands with
something frapp&rsquo;e out of a chafing-dish. Mr. McRamsey sighed, lost a vest button, gazed
with deep gratitude upon his fair preserveress, and then recovered consciousness.
To the Seaside Library all who are anticipating a romance! Banker McRamsey had an
aged and respected wife, and his sentiments toward Miss Merriam were fatherly. He talked
to her for half an hour with interest - not the kind that went with his talks during business
hours. The next day he brought Mrs. McRamsey down to see her. The old couple were
childless - they had only a married daughter living in Brooklyn.To make a short story shorter, the beautiful cashier won the hearts of the good old
couple. They came to Hinkle&rsquo;s again and again; they invited her to their old-fashioned but
splendid home in one of the East Seventies. Miss Merriam&rsquo;s winning loveliness, her sweet
frankness and impulsive heart took them by storm. They said a hundred times that Miss
Merriam reminded them so much of their lost daughter. The Brooklyn matron, n&rsquo;ee Ramsey,
had the figure of Buddha and a face like the ideal of an art photographer. Miss Merriam was
a combination of curves, smiles, rose leaves, pearls, satin and hair-tonic posters. Enough of
the fatuity of parents.
A month after the worthy couple became acquainted with Miss Merriam, she stood
before Hinkle one afternoon and resigned her cashiership.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to adopt me,&rdquo; she told the bereft restaurateur. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re funny old
people, but regular dears. And the swell home they have got! Say, Hinkle, there isn&rsquo;t any use
of talking - I&rsquo;m on the a la carte to wear brown duds and goggles in a whiz wagon, or marry a
duke at least. Still, I somehow hate to break out of the old cage. I&rsquo;ve been cashiering so long
I feel funny doing anything else. I&rsquo;ll miss joshing the fellows awfully when they line up to pay
for the buckwheats and. But I can&rsquo;t let this chance slide. And they&rsquo;re awfully good, Hinkle; I
know I&rsquo;ll have a swell time. You owe me nine-sixty-two and a half for the week. Cut out the
half if it hurts you, Hinkle.&rdquo;
And they did. Miss Merriam became Miss Rosa McRamsey. And she graced the
transition. Beauty is only skin-deep, but the nerves lie very near to the skin. Nerve - but just
here will you oblige by perusing again the quotation with which this story begins?
The McRamseys poured out money like domestic champagne to polish their adopted
one. Milliners, dancing masters and private tutors got it. Miss - er - McRamsey was grateful,
loving, and tried to forget Hinkle&rsquo;s. To give ample credit to the adaptability of the American
girl, Hinkle&rsquo;s did fade from her memory and speech most of the time.
Not every one will remember when the Earl of Hitesbury came to East Seventy - -Street,
America. He was only a fair-to-medium earl, without debts, and he created little excitement.
But you will surely remember the evening when the Daughters of Benevolence haled their
bazaar in the W - -f-A - -a Hotel. For you were there, and you wrote a note to Fannie on the
hotel paper, and mailed it, just to show her that - you did not? Very well; that was the
evening the baby was sick, of course.
At the bazaar the McRamseys were prominent. Miss Mer - er - McRamsey was
exquisitely beautiful. The Earl of Hitesbury had been very attentive to her since he dropped
in to have a look at America. At the charity bazaar the affair was supposed to be going to be
pulled off to a finish. An earl is as good as a duke. Better. His standing may be lower, but his
outstanding accounts are also lower.Our ex-young-lady-cashier was assigned to a booth. She was expected to sell worthless
articles to nobs and snobs at exorbitant prices. The proceeds of the bazaar were to be used
for giving the poor children of the slums a Christmas din - -Say! did you ever wonder where
they get the other 364?
Miss McRamsey - beautiful, palpitating, excited, charming, radiant - fluttered about in
her booth. An imitation brass network, with a little arched opening, fenced her in.
Along came the Earl, assured, delicate, accurate, admiring - admiring greatly, and faced
the open wicket.
&ldquo;You look chawming, you know - &lsquo;pon my word you do - my deah,&rdquo; he said, beguilingly.
&ldquo;Cut that joshing out,&rdquo; she said, coolly and briskly. &ldquo;Who do you think you are talking to?
Your check, please. Oh, Lordy! -&rdquo;
Patrons of the bazaar became aware of a commotion and pressed around a certain
booth. The Earl of Hitesbury stood near by pulling a pale blond and puzzled whisker.
&ldquo;Miss McRamsey has fainted,&rdquo; some one explained.
The Gold That Glittered （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>A story with a moral appended is like the bill of a mosquito. It bores you, and then
injects a stinging drop to irritate your conscience. Therefore let us have the moral first and
be done with it. All is not gold that glitters, but it is a wise child that keeps the stopper in his
bottle of testing acid.
Where Broadway skirts the corner of the square presided over by George the Veracious
is the Little Rialto. Here stand the actors of that quarter, and this is their shibboleth: &ldquo;&lsquo;Nit,&rsquo;
says I to Frohman, &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t touch me for a kopeck less than two-fifty per,&rsquo; and out I walks.&rdquo;
Westward and southward from the Thespian glare are one or two streets where a
Spanish-American colony has huddled for a little tropical warmth in the nipping North. The
centre of life in this precinct is &ldquo;El Refugio,&rdquo; a cafe and restaurant that caters to the volatile
exiles from the South. Up from Chili, Bolivia, Colombia, the rolling republics of Central
America and the ireful islands of the Western Indies flit the cloaked and sombreroed senores,
who are scattered like burning lava by the political eruptions of their several countries.Hither they come to lay counterplots, to bide their time, to solicit funds, to enlist
filibusterers, to smuggle out arms and ammunitions, to play the game at long taw. In El
Refugio, they find the atmosphere in which they thrive.
In the restaurant of El Refugio are served compounds delightful to the palate of the
man from Capricorn or Cancer. Altruism must halt the story thus long. On, diner, weary of
the culinary subterfuges of the Gallic chef, hie thee to El Refugio! There only will you find a
fish - bluefish, shad or pompano from the Gulf - baked after the Spanish method. Tomatoes
give it color, individuality and soul; chili colorado bestows upon it zest, originality and fervor;
unknown herbs furnish piquancy and mystery, and - but its crowning glory deserves a new
sentence. Around it, above it, beneath it, in its vicinity - but never in it - hovers an ethereal
aura, an effluvium so rarefied and delicate that only the Society for Psychical Research could
note its origin. Do not say that garlic is in the fish at El Refugio. It is not otherwise than as if
the spirit of Garlic, flitting past, has wafted one kiss that lingers in the parsley-crowned dish
as haunting as those kisses in life, &ldquo;by hopeless fancy feigned on lips that are for others.&rdquo;
And then, when Conchito, the waiter, brings you a plate of brown frijoles and carafe of wine
that has never stood still between Oporto and El Refugio - ah, Dios!
One day a Hamburg-American liner deposited upon Pier No. 55 Gen. Perrico Ximenes
Villablanca Falcon, a passenger from Cartagena. The General was between a claybank and
bay in complexion, had a 42-inch waist and stood 5 feet 4 with his Du Barry heels. He had
the mustache of a shooting-gallery proprietor, he wore the full dress of a Texas congressman
and had the important aspect of an uninstructed delegate.
Gen. Falcon had enough English under his hat to enable him to inquire his way to the
street in which El Refugio stood. When he reached that neighborhood he saw a sign before a
respectable red-brick house that read, &ldquo;Hotel Espanol.&rdquo; In the window was a card in Spanish,
&ldquo;Aqui se habla Espanol.&rdquo; The General entered, sure of a congenial port.
In the cozy office was Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien, the proprietress. She had blond - oh,
unimpeachably blond hair. For the rest she was amiability, and ran largely to inches around.
Gen. Falcon brushed the floor with his broad-brimmed hat, and emitted a quantity of
Spanish, the syllables sounding like firecrackers gently popping their way down the string of
a bunch.
&ldquo;Spanish or Dago?&rdquo; asked Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien, pleasantly.
&ldquo;I am a Colombian, madam,&rdquo; said the General, proudly. &ldquo;I speak the Spanish. The
advisment in your window say the Spanish he is spoken here. How is that?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve been speaking it, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the madam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
At the Hotel Espanol General Falcon engaged rooms and established himself. At dusk he
sauntered out upon the streets to view the wonders of this roaring city of the North. As hewalked he thought of the wonderful golden hair of Mme. O&rsquo;Brien. &ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; said the
General to himself, no doubt in his own language, &ldquo;that one shall find the most beautiful
senoras in the world. I have not in my Colombia viewed among our beauties one so fair. But
no! It is not for the General Falcon to think of beauty. It is my country that claims my
devotion.&rdquo;
At the corner of Broadway and the Little Rialto the General became involved. The street
cars bewildered him, and the fender of one upset him against a pushcart laden with oranges.
A cab driver missed him an inch with a hub, and poured barbarous execrations upon his
head. He scrambled to the sidewalk and skipped again in terror when the whistle of a
peanut-roaster puffed a hot scream in his ear. V&rsquo;algame Dios! What devil&rsquo;s city is this?&rdquo;
As the General fluttered out of the streamers of passers like a wounded snipe he was
marked simultaneously as game by two hunters. One was &ldquo;Bully&rdquo; McGuire, whose system of
sport required the use of a strong arm and the misuse of an eight-inch piece of lead pipe.
The other Nimrod of the asphalt was &ldquo;Spider&rdquo; Kelley, a sportsman with more refined
methods.
In pouncing upon their self-evident prey, Mr. Kelley was a shade the quicker. His elbow
fended accurately the onslaught of Mr. McGuire.
&ldquo;G&rsquo;wan!&rdquo; he commanded harshly. &ldquo;I saw it first.&rdquo; McGuire slunk away, awed by superior
intelligence.
&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Mr. Kelley, to the General, &ldquo;but you got balled up in the shuffle,
didn&rsquo;t you? Let me assist you.&rdquo; He picked up the General&rsquo;s hat and brushed the dust from it.
The ways of Mr. Kelley could not but succeed. The General, bewildered and dismayed
by the resounding streets, welcomed his deliverer as a caballero with a most disinterested
heart.
&ldquo;I have a desire,&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;to return to the hotel of O&rsquo;Brien, in which I am stop.
Caramba! senor, there is a loudness and rapidness of going and coming in the city of this
Nueva York.&rdquo;
Mr. Kelley&rsquo;s politeness would not suffer the distinguished Colombian to brave the
dangers of the return unaccompanied. At the door of the Hotel Espanol they paused. A little
lower down on the opposite side of the street shone the modest illuminated sign of El
Refugio. Mr. Kelley, to whom few streets were unfamiliar, knew the place exteriorly as a
&ldquo;Dago joint.&rdquo; All foreigners, Mr. Kelley classed under the two heads of &ldquo;Dagoes&rdquo; and
Frenchmen. He proposed to the General that they repair thither and substantiate their
acquaintance with a liquid foundation.An hour later found General Falcon and Mr. Kelley seated at a table in the conspirator&rsquo;s
corner of El Refugio. Bottles and glasses were between them. For the tenth time the General
confided the secret of his mission to the Estados Unidos. He was here, he declared, to
purchase arms - 2,000 stands of Winchester rifles - for the Colombian revolutionists. He had
drafts in his pocket drawn by the Cartagena Bank on its New York correspondent for $25,000.
At other tables other revolutionists were shouting their political secrets to their
fellow-plotters; but none was as loud as the General. He pounded the table; he hallooed for
some wine; he roared to his friend that his errand was a secret one, and not to be hinted at
to a living soul. Mr. Kelley himself was stirred to sympathetic enthusiasm. He grasped the
General&rsquo;s hand across the table.
&ldquo;Monseer,&rdquo; he said, earnestly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where this country of yours is, but I&rsquo;m for it.
I guess it must be a branch of the United States, though, for the poetry guys and the
schoolmarms call us Columbia, too, sometimes. It&rsquo;s a lucky thing for you that you butted into
me to-night. I&rsquo;m the only man in New York that can get this gun deal through for you. The
Secretary of War of the United States is me best friend. He&rsquo;s in the city now, and I&rsquo;ll see him
for you to-morrow. In the meantime, monseer, you keep them drafts tight in your inside
pocket. I&rsquo;ll call for you to-morrow, and take you to see him. Say! that ain&rsquo;t the District of
Columbia you&rsquo;re talking about, is it?&rdquo; concluded Mr. Kelley, with a sudden qualm. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
capture that with no 2,000 guns - it&rsquo;s been tried with more.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; exclaimed the General. &ldquo;It is the Republic of Colombia - it is a g-r-reat
republic on the top side of America of the South. Yes. Yes.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mr. Kelley, reassured. &ldquo;Now suppose we trek along home and go by-by.
I&rsquo;ll write to the Secretary to-night and make a date with him. It&rsquo;s a ticklish job to get guns out
of New York. McClusky himself can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
They parted at the door of the Hotel Espanol. The General rolled his eyes at the moon
and sighed.
&ldquo;It is a great country, your Nueva York,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Truly the cars in the streets devastate
one, and the engine that cooks the nuts terribly makes a squeak in the ear. But, ah, Senor
Kelley - the senoras with hair of much goldness, and admirable fatness - they are magnificas!
Muy magnificas!&rdquo;
Kelley went to the nearest telephone booth and called up McCrary&rsquo;s cafe, far up on
Broadway. He asked for Jimmy Dunn.
&ldquo;Is that Jimmy Dunn?&rdquo; asked Kelley.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the answer.&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar,&rdquo; sang back Kelley, joyfully. &ldquo;Your&rsquo;e the Secretary of War. Wait there till I
come up. I&rsquo;ve got the finest thing down here in the way of a fish you ever baited for. It&rsquo;s a
Colorado-maduro, with a gold band around it and free coupons enough to buy a red hall
lamp and a statuette of Psyche rubbering in the brook. I&rsquo;ll be up on the next car.&rdquo;
Jimmy Dunn was an A. M. of Crookdom. He was an artist in the confidence line. He
never saw a bludgeon in his life; and he scorned knockout drops. In fact, he would have set
nothing before an intended victim but the purest of drinks, if it had been possible to procure
such a thing in New York. It was the ambition of &ldquo;Spider&rdquo; Kelley to elevate himself into
Jimmy&rsquo;s class.
These two gentlemen held a conference that night at McCrary&rsquo;s. Kelley explained.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as easy as a gumshoe. He&rsquo;s from the Island of Colombia, where there&rsquo;s a strike, or
a feud, or something going on, and they&rsquo;ve sent him up here to buy 2,000 Winchesters to
arbitrate the thing with. He showed me two drafts for $10,000 each, and one for $5,000 on a
bank here. &rsquo;S truth, Jimmy, I felt real mad with him because he didn&rsquo;t have it in
thousand-dollar bills, and hand it to me on a silver waiter. Now, we&rsquo;ve got to wait till he goes
to the bank and gets the money for us.&rdquo;
They talked it over for two hours, and then Dunn said; &ldquo;Bring him to No. __ Broadway,
at four o&rsquo;clock to-morrow afternoon.&rdquo;
In due time Kelley called at the Hotel Espanol for the General. He found the wily warrior
engaged in delectable conversation with Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien.
&ldquo;The Secretary of War is waitin&rsquo; for us,&rdquo; said Kelley.
The General tore himself away with an effort.
&ldquo;Ay, senor,&rdquo; he said, with a sigh, &ldquo;duty makes a call. But, senor, the senoras of your
Estados Unidos - how beauties! For exemplification, take you la Madame O&rsquo;Brien - que
magnifica! She is one goddess - one Juno - what you call one ox-eyed Juno.&rdquo;
Now Mr. Kelley was a wit; and better men have been shriveled by the fire of their own
imagination.
&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; he said with a grin; &ldquo;but you mean a peroxide Juno, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien heard, and lifted an auriferous head. Her businesslike eye rested for an
instant upon the disappearing form of Mr. Kelley. Except in street cars one should never be
unnecessarily rude to a lady.When the gallant Colombian and his escort arrived at the Broadway address, they were
held in an anteroom for half an hour, and then admitted into a well-equipped office where a
distinguished looking man, with a smooth face, wrote at a desk. General Falcon was
presented to the Secretary of War of the United States, and his mission made known by his
old friend, Mr. Kelley.
&ldquo;Ah - Colombia!&rdquo; said the Secretary, significantly, when he was made to understand;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there will be a little difficutly in that case. The President and I differ in our
sympathies there. He prefers the established government, while I -&rdquo; the secretary gave the
General a mysterious but encouraging smile. &ldquo;You, of course, know, General Falcon, that
since the Tammany war, an act of Congress has been passed requiring all manufactured arms
and ammunition exported from this country to pass through the War Department. Now, if I
can do anything for you I will be glad to do so to oblige my old friend, Mr. Kelley. But it must
be in absolute secrecy, as the President, as I have said, does not regard favorably the efforts
of your revolutionary party in Colombia. I will have my orderly bring a list of the available
arms now in the warehouse.&rdquo;
The Secretary struck a bell, and an orderly with the letters A. D. T. on his cap stepped
promptly into the room.
&ldquo;Bring me Schedule B of the small arms inventory,&rdquo; said the Secretary.
The orderly quickly returned with a printed paper. The Secretary studied it closely.
&ldquo;I find,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that in Warehouse 9, of Government stores, there is shipment of
2,000 stands of Winchester rifles that were ordered by the Sultan of Morocco, who forgot to
send the cash with his order. Our rule is that legal-tender must be paid down at the time of
purchase. My dear Kelley, your friend, General Falcon, shall have this lot of arms, if he
desires it, at the manufacturer&rsquo;s price. And you will forgive me, I am sure, if I curtail our
interview. I am expecting the Japanese Minister and Charles Murphy every moment!&rdquo;
As one result of this interview, the General was deeply grateful to his esteemed friend,
Mr. Kelley. As another, the nimble Secretary of War was extremely busy during the next two
days buying empty rifle cases and filling them with bricks, which were then stored in a
warehouse rented for that purpose. As still another, when the General returned to the Hotel
Espanol, Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien went up to him, plucked a thread from his lapel, and said:
&ldquo;Say, senor, I don&rsquo;t want to &lsquo;butt in,&rsquo; but what does that monkey-faced, cat-eyed,
rubber-necked tin horn tough want with you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sangre de mi vida!&rdquo; exclaimed the General. &ldquo;Impossible it is that you speak of my good
friend, Senor Kelley.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Come into the summer garden,&rdquo; said Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien. &ldquo;I want to have a talk with you.&ldquo;Let us suppose that an hour has elapsed.
&ldquo;And you say,&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;that for the sum of $18,000 can be purchased the
furnishment of the house and the lease of one year with this garden so lovely - so
resembling unto the patios of my cara Colombia?&rdquo;
&ldquo;And dirt cheap at that,&rdquo; sighed the lady.
&ldquo;Ah, Dios!&rdquo; breathed General Falcon. &ldquo;What to me is war and politics? This spot is one
paradise. My country it have other brave heroes to continue the fighting. What to me should
be glory and the shooting of mans? Ah! no. It is here I have found one angel. Let us buy the
Hotel Espanol and you shall be mine, and the money shall not be waste on guns.&rdquo;
Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien rested her blond pompadour against the shoulder of the Colombian
patriot.
&ldquo;Oh, senor,&rdquo; she sighed, happily, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t you terrible!&rdquo;
Two days later was the time appointed for the delivery of the arms to the General. The
boxes of supposed rifles were stacked in the rented warehouse, and the Secretary of War sat
upon them, waiting for his friend Kelley to fetch the victim.
Mr. Kelley hurried, at the hour, to the Hotel Espanol. He found the General behind the
desk adding up accounts.
&ldquo;I have decide,&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;to buy not guns. I have to-day buy the insides of this
hotel, and there shall be marrying of the General Perrico Ximenes Villablanca Falcon with la
Madame O&rsquo;Brien.&rdquo;
Mr. Kelley almost strangled.
&ldquo;Say, you old bald-headed bottle of shoe polish,&rdquo; he spluttered, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a swindler -
that&rsquo;s what you are! You&rsquo;ve bought a boarding house with money belonging to your infernal
country, wherever it is.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the General, footing up a column, &ldquo;that is what you call politics. War and
revolution they are not nice. Yes. It is not best that one shall always follow Minerva. No. It is
of quite desirable to keep hotels and be with that Juno - that ox-eyed Juno. Ah! what hair of
the gold it is that she have!&rdquo;
Mr. Kelley choked again.&ldquo;Ah, Senor Kelley!&rdquo; said the General, feelingly and finally, &ldquo;is it that you have never
eaten of the corned beef hash that Madame O&rsquo;Brien she make?&rdquo;
The Green Door （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Suppose you should be walking down Broadway after dinner, with ten minutes allotted
to the consummation of your cigar while you are choosing between a diverting tragedy and
something serious in the way of vaudeville. Suddenly a hand is laid upon your arm. You turn
to look into the thrilling eyes of a beautiful woman, wonderful in diamonds and Russian
sables. She thrusts hurriedly into your hand an extremely hot buttered roll, flashes out a tiny
pair of scissors, snips off the second button of your overcoat, meaningly ejaculates the one
word, &ldquo;parallelogram!&rdquo; and swiftly flies down a cross street, looking back fearfully over her
shoulder.
That would be pure adventure. Would you accept it? Not you. You would flush with
embarrassment; you would sheepishly drop the roll and continue down Broadway, fumbling
feebly for the missing button. This you would do unless you are one of the blessed few in
whom the pure spirit of adventure is not dead.
True adventurers have never been plentiful. They who are set down in print as such
have been mostly business men with newly invented methods. They have been out after the
things they wanted&ndash;golden fleeces, holy grails, lady loves, treasure, crowns and fame. The
true adventurer goes forth aimless and uncalculating to meet and greet unknown fate. A
fine example was the Prodigal Son&ndash;when he started back home.
Half-adventurers&ndash;brave and splendid figures&ndash;have been numerous. From the Crusades
to the Palisades they have enriched the arts of history and fiction and the trade of historical
fiction. But each of them had a prize to win, a goal to kick, an axe to grind, a race to run, a
new thrust in tierce to deliver, a name to carve, a crow to pick&ndash;so they were not followers of
true adventure.
In the big city the twin spirits Romance and Adventure are always abroad seeking
worthy wooers. As we roam the streets they slyly peep at us and challenge us in twenty
different guises. Without knowing why, we look up suddenly to see in a window a face that
seems to belong to our gallery of intimate portraits; in a sleeping thoroughfare we hear a cry
of agony and fear coming from an empty and shuttered house; instead of at our familiar
curb, a cab-driver deposits us before a strange door, which one, with a smile, opens for us
and bids us enter; a slip of paper, written upon, flutters down to our feet from the high
lattices of Chance; we exchange glances of instantaneous hate, affection and fear with
hurrying strangers in the passing crowds; a sudden douse of rain&ndash;and our umbrella may besheltering the daughter of the Full Moon and first cousin of the Sidereal System; at every
corner handkerchiefs drop, fingers beckon, eyes besiege, and the lost, the lonely, the
rapturous, the mysterious, the perilous, changing clues of adventure are slipped into our
fingers. But few of us are willing to hold and follow them. We are grown stiff with the
ramrod of convention down our backs. We pass on; and some day we come, at the end of a
very dull life, to reflect that our romance has been a pallid thing of a marriage or two, a satin
rosette kept in a safe-deposit drawer, and a lifelong feud with a steam radiator.
Rudolf Steiner was a true adventurer. Few were the evenings on which he did not go
forth from his hall bedchamber in search of the unexpected and the egregious. The most
interesting thing in life seemed to him to be what might lie just around the next corner.
Sometimes his willingness to tempt fate led him into strange paths. Twice he had spent the
night in a station-house; again and again he had found himself the dupe of ingenious and
mercenary tricksters; his watch and money had been the price of one flattering allurement.
But with undiminished ardour he picked up every glove cast before him into the merry lists
of adventure.
One evening Rudolf was strolling along a crosstown street in the older central part of
the city. Two streams of people filled the sidewalks&ndash;the home-hurrying, and that restless
contingent that abandons home for the specious welcome of the thousand-candle-power
table d&rsquo;hote.
The young adventurer was of pleasing presence, and moved serenely and watchfully. By
daylight he was a salesman in a piano store. He wore his tie drawn through a topaz ring
instead of fastened with a stick pin; and once he had written to the editor of a magazine that
&ldquo;Junie&rsquo;s Love Test&rdquo; by Miss Libbey, had been the book that had most influenced his life.
During his walk a violent chattering of teeth in a glass case on the sidewalk seemed at
first to draw his attention (with a qualm), to a restaurant before which it was set; but a
second glance revealed the electric letters of a dentist&rsquo;s sign high above the next door. A
giant negro, fantastically dressed in a red embroidered coat, yellow trousers and a military
cap, discreetly distributed cards to those of the passing crowd who consented to take them.
This mode of dentistic advertising was a common sight to Rudolf. Usually he passed the
dispenser of the dentist&rsquo;s cards without reducing his store; but tonight the African slipped
one into his hand so deftly that he retained it there smiling a little at the successful feat.
When he had travelled a few yards further he glanced at the card indifferently.
Surprised, he turned it over and looked again with interest. One side of the card was blank;
on the other was written in ink three words, &ldquo;The Green Door.&rdquo; And then Rudolf saw, three
steps in front of him, a man throw down the card the negro had given him as he passed.
Rudolf picked it up. It was printed with the dentist&rsquo;s name and address and the usual
schedule of &ldquo;plate work&rdquo; and &ldquo;bridge work&rdquo; and specious promises of &ldquo;painless&rdquo; operations.The adventurous piano salesman halted at the corner and considered. Then he crossed
the street, walked down a block, recrossed and joined the upward current of people again.
Without seeming to notice the negro as he passed the second time, he carelessly took the
card that was handed him. Ten steps away he inspected it. In the same handwriting that
appeared on the first card &ldquo;The Green Door&rdquo; was inscribed upon it. Three or four cards were
tossed to the pavement by pedestrians both following and leading him. These fell blank side
up. Rudolf turned them over. Every one bore the printed legend of the dental &ldquo;parlours.&rdquo;
Rarely did the arch sprite Adventure need to beckon twice to Rudolf Steiner, his true
follower. But twice it had been done, and the quest was on.
Rudolf walked slowly back to where the giant negro stood by the case of rattling teeth.
This time as he passed he received no card. In spite of his gaudy and ridiculous garb, the
Ethiopian displayed a natural barbaric dignity as he stood, offering the cards suavely to some,
allowing others to pass unmolested. Every half minute he chanted a harsh, unintelligible
phrase akin to the jabber of car conductors and grand opera. And not only did he withhold a
card this time, but it seemed to Rudolf that he received from the shining and massive black
countenance a look of cold, almost contemptuous disdain.
The look stung the adventurer. He read in it a silent accusation that he had been found
wanting. Whatever the mysterious written words on the cards might mean, the black had
selected him twice from the throng for their recipient; and now seemed to have condemned
him as deficient in the wit and spirit to engage the enigma.
Standing aside from the rush, the young man made a rapid estimate of the building in
which he conceived that his adventure must lie. Five stories high it rose. A small restaurant
occupied the basement.
The first floor, now closed, seemed to house millinery or furs. The second floor, by the
winking electric letters, was the dentist&rsquo;s. Above this a polyglot babel of signs struggled to
indicate the abodes of palmists, dressmakers, musicians and doctors. Still higher up draped
curtains and milk bottles white on the window sills proclaimed the regions of domesticity.
After concluding his survey Rudolf walked briskly up the high flight of stone steps into
the house. Up two flights of the carpeted stairway he continued; and at its top paused. The
hallway there was dimly lighted by two pale jets of gas one&ndash;far to his right, the other nearer,
to his left. He looked toward the nearer light and saw, within its wan halo, a green door. For
one moment he hesitated; then he seemed to see the contumelious sneer of the African
juggler of cards; and then he walked straight to the green door and knocked against it.
Moments like those that passed before his knock was answered measure the quick
breath of true adventure. What might not be behind those green panels! Gamesters at play;
cunning rogues baiting their traps with subtle skill; beauty in love with courage, and thusplanning to be sought by it; danger, death, love, disappointment, ridicule&ndash;any of these
might respond to that temerarious rap.
A faint rustle was heard inside, and the door slowly opened. A girl not yet twenty stood
there, white-faced and tottering. She loosed the knob and swayed weakly, groping with one
hand. Rudolf caught her and laid her on a faded couch that stood against the wall. He closed
the door and took a swift glance around the room by the light of a flickering gas jet. Neat,
but extreme poverty was the story that he read.
The girl lay still, as if in a faint. Rudolf looked around the room excitedly for a barrel.
People must be rolled upon a barrel who&ndash;no, no; that was for drowned persons. He began
to fan her with his hat. That was successful, for he struck her nose with the brim of his derby
and she opened her eyes. And then the young man saw that hers, indeed, was the one
missing face from his heart&rsquo;s gallery of intimate portraits. The frank, grey eyes, the little nose,
turning pertly outward; the chestnut hair, curling like the tendrils of a pea vine, seemed the
right end and reward of all his wonderful adventures. But the face was wofully thin and pale.
The girl looked at him calmly, and then smiled.
&ldquo;Fainted, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she asked, weakly. &ldquo;Well, who wouldn&rsquo;t? You try going without
anything to eat for three days and see!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Himmel!&rdquo; exclaimed Rudolf, jumping up. &ldquo;Wait till I come back.&rdquo;
He dashed out the green door and down the stairs. In twenty minutes he was back
again, kicking at the door with his toe for her to open it. With both arms he hugged an array
of wares from the grocery and the restaurant. On the table he laid them&ndash;bread and butter,
cold meats, cakes, pies, pickles, oysters, a roasted chicken, a bottle of milk and one of redhot
tea.
&ldquo;This is ridiculous,&rdquo; said Rudolf, blusteringly, &ldquo;to go without eating. You must quit
making election bets of this kind. Supper is ready.&rdquo; He helped her to a chair at the table and
asked: &ldquo;Is there a cup for the tea?&rdquo; &ldquo;On the shelf by the window,&rdquo; she answered. When he
turned again with the cup he saw her, with eyes shining rapturously, beginning upon a huge
Dill pickle that she had rooted out from the paper bags with a woman&rsquo;s unerring instinct. He
took it from her, laughingly, and poured the cup full of milk. &ldquo;Drink that first&rdquo; he ordered,
&ldquo;and then you shall have some tea, and then a chicken wing. If you are very good you shall
have a pickle to-morrow. And now, if you&rsquo;ll allow me to be your guest we&rsquo;ll have supper.&rdquo;
He drew up the other chair. The tea brightened the girl&rsquo;s eyes and brought back some
of her colour. She began to eat with a sort of dainty ferocity like some starved wild animal.
She seemcd to regard the young man&rsquo;s presence and the aid he had rendered her as a
natural thing&ndash;not as though she undervalued the conventions; but as one whose great
stress gave her the right to put aside the artificial for the human. But gradually, with thereturn of strength and comfort, came also a sense of the little conventions that belong; and
she began to tell him her little story. It was one of a thousand such as the city yawns at every
day&ndash;the shop girl&rsquo;s story of insufficient wages, further reduced by &ldquo;fines&rdquo; that go to swell
the store&rsquo;s profits; of time lost through illness; and then of lost positions, lost hope, and&ndash;the
knock of the adventurer upon the green door.
But to Rudolf the history sounded as big as the Iliad or the crisis in &ldquo;Junie&rsquo;s Love Test.&rdquo;
&ldquo;To think of you going through all that,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;It was something fierce,&rdquo; said the girl, solemnly.
&ldquo;And you have no relatives or friends in the city?&rdquo;
&ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am all alone in the world, too,&rdquo; said Rudolf, after a pause.
&ldquo;I am glad of that,&rdquo; said the girl, promptly; and somehow it pleased the young man to
hear that she approved of his bereft condition.
Very suddenly her eyelids dropped and she sighed deeply.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sleepy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I feel so good.&rdquo;
Then Rudolf rose and took his hat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say good-night. A long night&rsquo;s sleep will be fine
for you.&rdquo;
He held out his hand, and she took it and said &ldquo;good-night.&rdquo; But her eyes asked a
question so eloquently, so frankly and pathetically that he answered it with words.
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m coming back to-morrow to see how you are getting along. You can&rsquo;t get rid of
me so easily.&rdquo;
Then, at the door, as though the way of his coming had been so much less important
than the fact that he had come, she asked: &ldquo;How did you come to knock at my door?&rdquo;
He looked at her for a moment, remembering the cards, and felt a sudden jealous pain.
What if they had fallen into other hands as adventurous as his? Quickly he decided that she
must never know the truth. He would never let her know that he was aware of the strange
expedient to which she had been driven by her great distress.
&ldquo;One of our piano tuners lives in this house,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I knocked at your door by
mistake.&ldquo;The last thing he saw in the room before the green door closed was her smile.
At the head of the stairway he paused and looked curiously about him. And then he
went along the hallway to its other end; and, coming back, ascended to the floor above and
continued his puzzled explorations. Every door that he found in the house was painted
green.
Wondering, he descended to the sidewalk. The fantastic African was still there. Rudolf
confronted him with his two cards in his hand.
&ldquo;Will you tell me why you gave me these cards and what they mean?&rdquo; he asked.
In a broad, good-natured grin the negro exhibited a splendid advertisement of his
master&rsquo;s profession.
&ldquo;Dar it is, boss,&rdquo; he said, pointing down the street. &ldquo;But I &lsquo;spect you is a little late for de
fust act.&rdquo;
Looking the way he pointed Rudolf saw above the entrance to a theatre the blazing
electric sign of its new play, &ldquo;The Green Door.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m informed dat it&rsquo;s a fust-rate show, sah,&rdquo; said the negro. &ldquo;De agent what represents
it pussented me with a dollar, sah, to distribute a few of his cards along with de doctah&rsquo;s.
May I offer you one of de doctah&rsquo;s cards, sah?&rdquo;
At the corner of the block in which he lived Rudolf stopped for a glass of beer and a
cigar. When he had come out with his lighted weed he buttoned his coat, pushed back his
hat and said, stoutly, to the lamp post on the corner:
&ldquo;All the same, I believe it was the hand of Fate that doped out the way for me to find
her.&rdquo;
Which conclusion, under the circumstances, certainly admits Rudolf Steiner to the
ranks of the true followers of Romance and Adventure.
The Handbook of Hymen （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>&lsquo;Tis the opinion of myself, Sanderson Pratt, who sets this down, that the educational
system of the United States should be in the hands of the weather bureau. I can give yougood reasons for it; and you can&rsquo;t tell me why our college professors shouldn&rsquo;t be
transferred to the meteorological department. They have been learned to read; and they
could very easily glance at the morning papers and then wire in to the main office what kind
of weather to expect. But there&rsquo;s the other side of the proposition. I am going on to tell you
how the weather furnished me and Idaho Green with an elegant education.
We was up in the Bitter Root Mountains over the Montana line prospecting for gold. A
chin-whiskered man in Walla-Walla, carrying a line of hope as excess baggage, had
grubstaked us; and there we was in the foothills pecking away, with enough grub on hand to
last an army through a peace conference.
Along one day comes a mail-rider over the mountains from Carlos, and stops to eat
three cans of greengages, and leave us a newspaper of modern date. This paper prints a
system of premonitions of the weather, and the card it dealt Bitter Root Mountains from the
bottom of the deck was &ldquo;warmer and fair, with light westerly breezes.&rdquo;
That evening it began to snow, with the wind strong in the east. Me and Idaho moved
camp into an old empty cabin higher up the mountain, thinking it was only a November
flurry. But after falling three foot on a level it went to work in earnest; and we knew we was
snowed in. We got in plenty of firewood before it got deep, and we had grub enough for two
months, so we let the elements rage and cut up all they thought proper.
If you want to instigate the art of manslaughter just shut two men up in a eighteen by
twenty-foot cabin for a month. Human nature won&rsquo;t stand it.
When the first snowflakes fell me and Idaho Green laughed at each other&rsquo;s jokes and
praised the stuff we turned out of a skillet and called bread. At the end of three weeks Idaho
makes this kind of a edict to me. Says he:
&ldquo;I never exactly heard sour milk dropping out of a balloon on the bottom of a tin pan,
but I have an idea it would be music of the spears compared to this attenuated stream of
asphyxiated thought that emanates out of your organs of conversation. The kind of halfmasticated noises that you emit every day puts me in mind of a cow&rsquo;s cud, only she&rsquo;s lady
enough to keep hers to herself, and you ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mr. Green,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you having been a friend of mine once, I have some hesitations in
confessing to you that if I had my choice for society between you and a common yellow,
three-legged cur pup, one of the inmates of this here cabin would be wagging a tail just at
present.&rdquo;
This way we goes on for two or three days, and then we quits speaking to one another.
We divides up the cooking implements, and Idaho cooks his grub on one side of the fireplace,
and me on the other. The snow is up to the windows, and we have to keep a fire all day.You see me and Idaho never had any education beyond reading and doing &ldquo;if John had
three apples and James five&rdquo; on a slate. We never felt any special need for a university
degree, though we had acquired a species of intrinsic intelligence in knocking around the
world that we could use in emergencies. But, snowbound in that cabin in the Bitter Roots,
we felt for the first time that if we had studied Homer or Greek and fractions and the higher
branches of information, we&rsquo;d have had some resources in the line of meditation and private
thought. I&rsquo;ve seen them Eastern college fellows working in camps all through the West, and I
never noticed but what education was less of a drawback to &lsquo;em than you would think. Why,
once over on Snake River, when Andrew McWilliams&rsquo; saddle horse got the botts, he sent a
buckboard ten miles for one of these strangers that claimed to be a botanist. But that horse
died.
One morning Idaho was poking around with a stick on top of a little shelf that was too
high to reach. Two books fell down to the floor. I started toward &lsquo;em, but caught Idaho&rsquo;s eye.
He speaks for the first time in a week.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t burn your fingers,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;In spite of the fact that you&rsquo;re only fit to be the
companion of a sleeping mud-turtle, I&rsquo;ll give you a square deal. And that&rsquo;s more than your
parents did when they turned you loose in the world with the sociability of a rattle-snake
and the bedside manner of a frozen turnip. I&rsquo;ll play you a game of seven-up, the winner to
pick up his choice of the book, the loser to take the other.&rdquo;
We played; and Idaho won. He picked up his book; and I took mine. Then each of us got
on his side of the house and went to reading.
I never was as glad to see a ten-ounce nugget as I was that book. And Idaho took at his
like a kid looks at a stick of candy.
Mine was a little book about five by six inches called &ldquo;Herkimer&rsquo;s Handbook of
Indispensable Information.&rdquo; I may be wrong, but I think that was the greatest book that ever
was written. I&rsquo;ve got it to-day; and I can stump you or any man fifty times in five minutes
with the information in it. Talk about Solomon or the New York Tribune! Herkimer had cases
on both of &lsquo;em. That man must have put in fifty years and travelled a million miles to find
out all that stuff. There was the population of all cities in it, and the way to tell a girl&rsquo;s age,
and the number of teeth a camel has. It told you the longest tunnel in the world, the
number of the stars, how long it takes for chicken pox to break out, what a lady&rsquo;s neck ought
to measure, the veto powers of Governors, the dates of the Roman aqueducts, how many
pounds of rice going without three beers a day would buy, the average annual temperature
of Augusta, Maine, the quantity of seed required to plant an acre of carrots in drills,
antidotes for poisons, the number of hairs on a blond lady&rsquo;s head, how to preserve eggs, the
height of all the mountains in the world, and the dates of all wars and battles, and how to
restore drowned persons, and sunstroke, and the number of tacks in a pound, and how to
make dynamite and flowers and beds, and what to do before the doctor comes&ndash;and ahundred times as many things besides. If there was anything Herkimer didn&rsquo;t know I didn&rsquo;t
miss it out of the book.
I sat and read that book for four hours. All the wonders of education was compressed in
it. I forgot the snow, and I forgot that me and old Idaho was on the outs. He was sitting still
on a stool reading away with a kind of partly soft and partly mysterious look shining through
his tan-bark whiskers.
&ldquo;Idaho,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;what kind of a book is yours?&rdquo;
Idaho must have forgot, too, for he answered moderate, without any slander or
malignity.
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;this here seems to be a volume by Homer K. M.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Homer K. M. what?&rdquo; I asks.
&ldquo;Why, just Homer K. M.,&rdquo; says he.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar,&rdquo; says I, a little riled that Idaho should try to put me up a tree. &ldquo;No man is
going &lsquo;round signing books with his initials. If it&rsquo;s Homer K. M. Spoopendyke, or Homer K. M.
McSweeney, or Homer K. M. Jones, why don&rsquo;t you say so like a man instead of biting off the
end of it like a calf chewing off the tail of a shirt on a clothes- line?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I put it to you straight, Sandy,&rdquo; says Idaho, quiet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a poem book,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;by
Homer K. M. I couldn&rsquo;t get colour out of it at first, but there&rsquo;s a vein if you follow it up. I
wouldn&rsquo;t have missed this book for a pair of red blankets.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to it,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;What I want is a disinterested statement of facts for the
mind to work on, and that&rsquo;s what I seem to find in the book I&rsquo;ve drawn.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What you&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; says Idaho, &ldquo;is statistics, the lowest grade of information that exists.
They&rsquo;ll poison your mind. Give me old K. M.&rsquo;s system of surmises. He seems to be a kind of a
wine agent. His regular toast is &lsquo;nothing doing,&rsquo; and he seems to have a grouch, but he keeps
it so well lubricated with booze that his worst kicks sound like an invitation to split a quart.
But it&rsquo;s poetry,&rdquo; says Idaho, &ldquo;and I have sensations of scorn for that truck of yours that tries
to convey sense in feet and inches. When it comes to explaining the instinct of philosophy
through the art of nature, old K. M. has got your man beat by drills, rows, paragraphs, chest
measurement, and average annual rainfall.&rdquo;
So that&rsquo;s the way me and Idaho had it. Day and night all the excitement we got was
studying our books. That snowstorm sure fixed us with a fine lot of attainments apiece. By
the time the snow melted, if you had stepped up to me suddenly and said: &ldquo;Sanderson Pratt,
what would it cost per square foot to lay a roof with twenty by twenty- eight tin at ninedollars and fifty cents per box?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d have told you as quick as light could travel the length of a
spade handle at the rate of one hundred and ninety-two thousand miles per second. How
many can do it? You wake up &lsquo;most any man you know in the middle of the night, and ask
him quick to tell you the number of bones in the human skeleton exclusive of the teeth, or
what percentage of the vote of the Nebraska Legislature overrules a veto. Will he tell you?
Try him and see.
About what benefit Idaho got out of his poetry book I didn&rsquo;t exactly know. Idaho
boosted the wine-agent every time he opened his mouth; but I wasn&rsquo;t so sure.
This Homer K. M., from what leaked out of his libretto through Idaho, seemed to me to
be a kind of a dog who looked at life like it was a tin can tied to his tail. After running himself
half to death, he sits down, hangs his tongue out, and looks at the can and says:
&ldquo;Oh, well, since we can&rsquo;t shake the growler, let&rsquo;s get it filled at the corner, and all have a
drink on me.&rdquo;
Besides that, it seems he was a Persian; and I never hear of Persia producing anything
worth mentioning unless it was Turkish rugs and Maltese cats.
That spring me and Idaho struck pay ore. It was a habit of ours to sell out quick and
keep moving. We unloaded our grubstaker for eight thousand dollars apiece; and then we
drifted down to this little town of Rosa, on the Salmon river, to rest up, and get some human
grub, and have our whiskers harvested.
Rosa was no mining-camp. It laid in the valley, and was as free of uproar and pestilence
as one of them rural towns in the country. There was a three-mile trolley line champing its
bit in the environs; and me and Idaho spent a week riding on one of the cars, dropping off at
nights at the Sunset View Hotel. Being now well read as well as travelled, we was soon pro
re nata with the best society in Rosa, and was invited out to the most dressed-up and
high-toned entertainments. It was at a piano recital and quail-eating contest in the city hall,
for the benefit of the fire company, that me and Idaho first met Mrs. De Ormond Sampson,
the queen of Rosa society.
Mrs. Sampson was a widow, and owned the only two-story house in town. It was
painted yellow, and whichever way you looked from you could see it as plain as egg on the
chin of an O&rsquo;Grady on a Friday. Twenty-two men in Rosa besides me and Idaho was trying to
stake a claim on that yellow house.
There was a dance after the song books and quail bones had been raked out of the Hall.
Twenty-three of the bunch galloped over to Mrs. Sampson and asked for a dance. I
side-stepped the two-step, and asked permission to escort her home. That&rsquo;s where I made a
hit.On the way home says she:
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t the stars lovely and bright to-night, Mr. Pratt?&rdquo;
&ldquo;For the chance they&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re humping themselves in a mighty
creditable way. That big one you see is sixty-six million miles distant. It took thirty-six years
for its light to reach us. With an eighteen-foot telescope you can see forty-three millions of
&lsquo;em, including them of the thirteenth magnitude, which, if one was to go out now, you
would keep on seeing it for twenty-seven hundred years.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My!&rdquo; says Mrs. Sampson. &ldquo;I never knew that before. How warm it is! I&rsquo;m as damp as I
can be from dancing so much.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy to account for,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;when you happen to know that you&rsquo;ve got two
million sweat-glands working all at once. If every one of your perspiratory ducts, which are a
quarter of an inch long, was placed end to end, they would reach a distance of seven miles.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lawsy!&rdquo; says Mrs. Sampson. &ldquo;It sounds like an irrigation ditch you was describing, Mr.
Pratt. How do you get all this knowledge of information?&rdquo;
&ldquo;From observation, Mrs. Sampson,&rdquo; I tells her. &ldquo;I keep my eyes open when I go about
the world.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mr. Pratt,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;I always did admire a man of education. There are so few
scholars among the sap-headed plug-uglies of this town that it is a real pleasure to converse
with a gentleman of culture. I&rsquo;d be gratified to have you call at my house whenever you feel
so inclined.&rdquo;
And that was the way I got the goodwill of the lady in the yellow house. Every Tuesday
and Friday evening I used to go there and tell her about the wonders of the universe as
discovered, tabulated, and compiled from nature by Herkimer. Idaho and the other gay
Lutherans of the town got every minute of the rest of the week that they could.
I never imagined that Idaho was trying to work on Mrs. Sampson with old K. M.&rsquo;s rules
of courtship till one afternoon when I was on my way over to take her a basket of wild
hog-plums. I met the lady coming down the lane that led to her house. Her eyes was
snapping, and her hat made a dangerous dip over one eye.
&ldquo;Mr. Pratt,&rdquo; she opens up, &ldquo;this Mr. Green is a friend of yours, I believe.&rdquo;
&ldquo;For nine years,&rdquo; says I.
&ldquo;Cut him out,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no gentleman!&rdquo;&ldquo;Why ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a plain incumbent of the mountains, with asperities and the
usual failings of a spendthrift and a liar, but I never on the most momentous occasion had
the heart to deny that he was a gentleman. It may be that in haberdashery and the sense of
arrogance and display Idaho offends the eye, but inside, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ve found him impervious
to the lower grades of crime and obesity. After nine years of Idaho&rsquo;s society, Mrs. Sampson,&rdquo;
I winds up, &ldquo;I should hate to impute him, and I should hate to see him imputed.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right plausible of you, Mr. Pratt,&rdquo; says Mrs. Sampson, &ldquo;to take up the curmudgeons
in your friend&rsquo;s behalf; but it don&rsquo;t alter the fact that he has made proposals to me
sufficiently obnoxious to ruffle the ignominy of any lady.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, now, now, now!&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Old Idaho do that! I could believe it of myself, sooner. I
never knew but one thing to deride in him; and a blizzard was responsible for that. Once
while we was snow-bound in the mountains he became a prey to a kind of spurious and
uneven poetry, which may have corrupted his demeanour.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It has,&rdquo; says Mrs. Sampson. &ldquo;Ever since I knew him he has been reciting to me a lot of
irreligious rhymes by some person he calls Ruby Ott, and who is no better than she should
be, if you judge by her poetry.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then Idaho has struck a new book,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;for the one he had was by a man who
writes under the nom de plume of K. M.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d better have stuck to it,&rdquo; says Mrs. Sampson, &ldquo;whatever it was. And to-day he caps
the vortex. I get a bunch of flowers from him, and on &lsquo;em is pinned a note. Now, Mr. Pratt,
you know a lady when you see her; and you know how I stand in Rosa society. Do you think
for a moment that I&rsquo;d skip out to the woods with a man along with a jug of wine and a loaf
of bread, and go singing and cavorting up and down under the trees with him? I take a little
claret with my meals, but I&rsquo;m not in the habit of packing a jug of it into the brush and raising
Cain in any such style as that. And of course he&rsquo;d bring his book of verses along, too. He said
so. Let him go on his scandalous picnics alone! Or let him take his Ruby Ott with him. I
reckon she wouldn&rsquo;t kick unless it was on account of there being too much bread along. And
what do you think of your gentleman friend now, Mr. Pratt?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;m,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;it may be that Idaho&rsquo;s invitation was a kind of poetry, and meant no
harm. May be it belonged to the class of rhymes they call figurative. They offend law and
order, but they get sent through the mails on the grounds that they mean something that
they don&rsquo;t say. I&rsquo;d be glad on Idaho&rsquo;s account if you&rsquo;d overlook it,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and let us
extricate our minds from the low regions of poetry to the higher planes of fact and fancy. On
a beautiful afternoon like this, Mrs. Sampson,&rdquo; I goes on, &ldquo;we should let our thoughts dwell
accordingly. Though it is warm here, we should remember that at the equator the line of
perpetual frost is at an altitude of fifteen thousand feet. Between the latitudes of forty
degrees and forty-nine degrees it is from four thousand to nine thousand feet.&ldquo;&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Pratt,&rdquo; says Mrs. Sampson, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s such a comfort to hear you say them beautiful
facts after getting such a jar from that minx of a Ruby&rsquo;s poetry!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Let us sit on this log at the roadside,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and forget the inhumanity and ribaldry of
the poets. It is in the glorious columns of ascertained facts and legalised measures that
beauty is to be found. In this very log we sit upon, Mrs. Sampson,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;is statistics more
wonderful than any poem. The rings show it was sixty years old. At the depth of two
thousand feet it would become coal in three thousand years. The deepest coal mine in the
world is at Killingworth, near Newcastle. A box four feet long, three feet wide, and two feet
eight inches deep will hold one ton of coal. If an artery is cut, compress it above the wound.
A man&rsquo;s leg contains thirty bones. The Tower of London was burned in 1841.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Go on, Mr. Pratt,&rdquo; says Mrs. Sampson. &ldquo;Them ideas is so original and soothing. I think
statistics are just as lovely as they can be.&rdquo;
But it wasn&rsquo;t till two weeks later that I got all that was coming to me out of Herkimer.
One night I was waked up by folks hollering &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; all around. I jumped up and dressed
and went out of the hotel to enjoy the scene. When I see it was Mrs. Sampson&rsquo;s house, I
gave forth a kind of yell, and I was there in two minutes.
The whole lower story of the yellow house was in flames, and every masculine,
feminine, and canine in Rosa was there, screeching and barking and getting in the way of the
firemen. I saw Idaho trying to get away from six firemen who were holding him. They was
telling him the whole place was on fire down-stairs, and no man could go in it and come out
alive.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mrs. Sampson?&rdquo; I asks.
&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t been seen,&rdquo; says one of the firemen. &ldquo;She sleeps up- stairs. We&rsquo;ve tried to
get in, but we can&rsquo;t, and our company hasn&rsquo;t got any ladders yet.&rdquo;
I runs around to the light of the big blaze, and pulls the Handbook out of my inside
pocket. I kind of laughed when I felt it in my hands &ndash;I reckon I was some daffy with the
sensation of excitement.
&ldquo;Herky, old boy,&rdquo; I says to it, as I flipped over the pages, &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t ever lied to me yet,
and you ain&rsquo;t ever throwed me down at a scratch yet. Tell me what, old boy, tell me what!&rdquo;
says I.
I turned to &ldquo;What to do in Case of Accidents,&rdquo; on page 117. I run my finger down the
page, and struck it. Good old Herkimer, he never overlooked anything! It said:Suffocation from Inhaling Smoke or Gas.&ndash;There is nothing better than flaxseed. Place a
few seed in the outer corner of the eye.
I shoved the Handbook back in my pocket, and grabbed a boy that was running by.
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says I, giving him some money, &ldquo;run to the drug store and bring a dollar&rsquo;s worth
of flaxseed. Hurry, and you&rsquo;ll get another one for yourself. Now,&rdquo; I sings out to the crowd,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have Mrs. Sampson!&rdquo; And I throws away my coat and hat.
Four of the firemen and citizens grabs hold of me. It&rsquo;s sure death, they say, to go in the
house, for the floors was beginning to fall through.
&ldquo;How in blazes,&rdquo; I sings out, kind of laughing yet, but not feeling like it, &ldquo;do you expect
me to put flaxseed in a eye without the eye?&rdquo;
I jabbed each elbow in a fireman&rsquo;s face, kicked the bark off of one citizen&rsquo;s shin, and
tripped the other one with a side hold. And then I busted into the house. If I die first I&rsquo;ll write
you a letter and tell you if it&rsquo;s any worse down there than the inside of that yellow house
was; but don&rsquo;t believe it yet. I was a heap more cooked than the hurry-up orders of broiled
chicken that you get in restaurants. The fire and smoke had me down on the floor twice, and
was about to shame Herkimer, but the firemen helped me with their little stream of water,
and I got to Mrs. Sampson&rsquo;s room. She&rsquo;d lost conscientiousness from the smoke, so I
wrapped her in the bed clothes and got her on my shoulder. Well, the floors wasn&rsquo;t as bad as
they said, or I never could have done it&ndash;not by no means.
I carried her out fifty yards from the house and laid her on the grass. Then, of course,
every one of them other twenty-two plaintiff&rsquo;s to the lady&rsquo;s hand crowded around with tin
dippers of water ready to save her. And up runs the boy with the flaxseed.
I unwrapped the covers from Mrs. Sampson&rsquo;s head. She opened her eyes and says:
&ldquo;Is that you, Mr. Pratt?&rdquo;
&ldquo;S-s-sh,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk till you&rsquo;ve had the remedy.&rdquo;
I runs my arm around her neck and raises her head, gentle, and breaks the bag of
flaxseed with the other hand; and as easy as I could I bends over and slips three or four of
the seeds in the outer corner of her eye.
Up gallops the village doc by this time, and snorts around, and grabs at Mrs. Sampson&rsquo;s
pulse, and wants to know what I mean by any such sandblasted nonsense.
&ldquo;Well, old Jalap and Jerusalem oakseed,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no regular practitioner, but I&rsquo;ll
show you my authority, anyway.&ldquo;They fetched my coat, and I gets out the Handbook.
&ldquo;Look on page 117,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;at the remedy for suffocation by smoke or gas. Flaxseed in
the outer corner of the eye, it says. I don&rsquo;t know whether it works as a smoke consumer or
whether it hikes the compound gastro-hippopotamus nerve into action, but Herkimer says it,
and he was called to the case first. If you want to make it a consultation, there&rsquo;s no
objection.&rdquo;
Old doc takes the book and looks at it by means of his specs and a fireman&rsquo;s lantern.
&ldquo;Well, Mr. Pratt,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you evidently got on the wrong line in reading your
diagnosis. The recipe for suffocation says: &lsquo;Get the patient into fresh air as quickly as
possible, and place in a reclining position.&rsquo; The flaxseed remedy is for &lsquo;Dust and Cinders in
the Eye,&rsquo; on the line above. But, after all&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; interrupts Mrs. Sampson, &ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ve got something to say in this
consultation. That flaxseed done me more good than anything I ever tried.&rdquo; And then she
raises up her head and lays it back on my arm again, and says: &ldquo;Put some in the other eye,
Sandy dear.&rdquo;
And so if you was to stop off at Rosa to-morrow, or any other day, you&rsquo;d see a fine new
yellow house with Mrs. Pratt, that was Mrs. Sampson, embellishing and adorning it. And if
you was to step inside you&rsquo;d see on the marble-top centre table in the parlour &ldquo;Herkimer&rsquo;s
Handbook of Indispensable Information,&rdquo; all rebound in red morocco, and ready to be
consulted on any subject pertaining to human happiness and wisdom.
He Also Serves （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>If I could have a thousand years&ndash;just one little thousand years&ndash;more of life, I might, in
that time, draw near enough to true Romance to touch the hem of her robe.
Up from ships men come, and from waste places and forest and road and garret and
cellar to maunder to me in strangely distributed words of the things they have seen and
considered. The recording of their tales is no more than a matter of ears and fingers. There
are only two fates I dread&ndash;deafness and writer&rsquo;s cramp. The hand is yet steady; let the ear
bear the blame if these printed words be not in the order they were delivered to me by
Hunky Magee, true camp-follower of fortune.Biography shall claim you but an instant&ndash;I first knew Hunky when he was head-waiter
at Chubb&rsquo;s little beefsteak restaurant and cafe on Third Avenue. There was only one waiter
besides.
Then, successively, I caromed against him in the little streets of the Big City after his trip
to Alaska, his voyage as cook with a treasure- seeking expedition to the Caribbean, and his
failure as a pearl-fisher in the Arkansas River. Between these dashes into the land of
adventure he usually came back to Chubb&rsquo;s for a while. Chubb&rsquo;s was a port for him when
gales blew too high; but when you dined there and Hunky went for your steak you never
knew whether he would come to anchor in the kitchen or in the Malayan Archipelago. You
wouldn&rsquo;t care for his description&ndash;he was soft of voice and hard of face, and rarely had to use
more than one eye to quell any approach to a disturbance among Chubb&rsquo;s customers.
One night I found Hunky standing at a corner of Twenty-third Street and Third Avenue
after an absence of several months. In ten minutes we had a little round table between us in
a quiet corner, and my ears began to get busy. I leave out my sly ruses and feints to draw
Hunky&rsquo;s word-of-mouth blows&ndash;it all came to something like this:
&ldquo;Speaking of the next election,&rdquo; said Hunky, &ldquo;did you ever know much about Indians?
No? I don&rsquo;t mean the Cooper, Beadle, cigar-store, or Laughing Water kind-I mean the
modern Indian&ndash;the kind that takes Greek prizes in colleges and scalps the half-back on the
other side in football games. The kind that eats macaroons and tea in the afternoons with
the daughter of the professor of biology, and fills up on grasshoppers and fried rattlesnake
when they get back to the ancestral wickiup.
&ldquo;Well, they ain&rsquo;t so bad. I like &lsquo;em better than most foreigners that have come over in
the last few hundred years. One thing about the Indian is this: when he mixes with the white
race he swaps all his own vices for them of the pale-faces&ndash;and he retains all his own virtues.
Well, his virtues are enough to call out the reserves whenever he lets &lsquo;em loose. But the
imported foreigners adopt our virtues and keep their own vices&ndash;and it&rsquo;s going to take our
whole standing army some day to police that gang.
&ldquo;But let me tell you about the trip I took to Mexico with High jack Snakefeeder, a
Cherokee twice removed, a graduate of a Pennsylvania college and the latest thing in
pointed-toed, rubber-heeled, patent kid moccasins and Madras hunting-shirt with
turned-back cuffs. He was a friend of mine. I met him in Tahlequah when I was out there
during the land boom, and we got thick. He had got all there was out of colleges and had
come back to lead his people out of Egypt. He was a man of first-class style and wrote essays,
and had been invited to visit rich guys&rsquo; houses in Boston and such places.
&ldquo;There was a Cherokee girl in Muscogee that High Jack was foolish about. He took me
to see her a few times. Her name was Florence Blue Feather&ndash;but you want to clear your
mind of all ideas of squaws with nose-rings and army blankets. This young lady was whiter
than you are, and better educated than I ever was. You couldn&rsquo;t have told her from any ofthe girls shopping in the swell Third Avenue stores. I liked her so well that, I got to calling on
her now and then when High Jack wasn&rsquo;t along, which is the way of friends in such matters.
She was educated at the Muscogee College, and was making a specialty of&ndash; let&rsquo;s
see&ndash;eth&ndash;yes, ethnology. That&rsquo;s the art that goes back and traces the descent of different
races of people, leading up from jelly-fish through monkeys and to the O&rsquo;Briens. High Jack
had took up that line too, and had read papers about it before all kinds of riotous
assemblies&ndash;Chautauquas and Choctaws and chowder-parties, and such. Having a mutual
taste for musty information like that was what made &lsquo;em like each other, I suppose. But I
don&rsquo;t know! What they call congeniality of tastes ain&rsquo;t always it. Now, when Miss Blue
Feather and me was talking together, I listened to her affidavits about the first families of the
Land of Nod being cousins german (well, if the Germans don&rsquo;t nod, who does?) to the
mound-builders of Ohio with incomprehension and respect. And when I&rsquo;d tell her about the
Bowery and Coney Island, and sing her a few songs that I&rsquo;d heard the Jamaica niggers sing at
their church lawn-parties, she didn&rsquo;t look much less interested than she did when High Jack
would tell her that he had a pipe that the first inhabitants of America originally arrived here
on stilts after a freshet at Tenafly, New Jersey.
&ldquo;But I was going to tell you more about High Jack.
&ldquo;About six months ago I get a letter from him, saying he&rsquo;d been commissioned by the
Minority Report Bureau of Ethnology at Washington to go down to Mexico and translate
some excavations or dig up the meaning of some shorthand notes on some ruins&ndash;or
something of that sort. And if I&rsquo;d go along he could squeeze the price into the expense
account.
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d been holding a napkin over my arm at Chubb&rsquo;s about long enough then, so I
wired High Jack &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;; and he sent me a ticket, and I met him in Washington, and he had a lot
of news to tell me. First of all, was that Florence Blue Feather had suddenly disappeared
from her home and environments.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Run away?&rsquo; I asked.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Vanished,&rsquo; says High Jack. &lsquo;Disappeared like your shadow when the sun goes under a
cloud. She was seen on the street, and then she turned a corner and nobody ever seen her
afterward. The whole community turned out to look for her, but we never found a clew.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s bad&ndash;that&rsquo;s bad,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;She was a mighty nice girl, and as smart as you find em.
&ldquo;High Jack seemed to take it hard. I guess he must have esteemed Miss Blue Feather
quite highly. I could see that he&rsquo;d referred the matter to the whiskey-jug. That was his weak
point&ndash;and many another man&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve noticed that when a man loses a girl he generally takes
to drink either just before or just after it happens.&ldquo;From Washington we railroaded it to New Orleans, and there took a tramp steamer
bound for Belize. And a gale pounded us all down the Caribbean, and nearly wrecked us on
the Yucatan coast opposite a little town without a harbor called Boca de Coacoyula. Suppose
the ship had run against that name in the dark!
&ldquo;&lsquo;Better fifty years of Europe than a cyclone in the bay,&rsquo; says High Jack Snakefeeder. So
we get the captain to send us ashore in a dory when the squall seemed to cease from
squalling.
&ldquo;&lsquo;We will find ruins here or make &lsquo;em,&rsquo; says High. &lsquo;The Government doesn&rsquo;t care which
we do. An appropriation is an appropriation.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Boca de Coacoyula was a dead town. Them biblical towns we read about&ndash;Tired and
Siphon&ndash;after they was destroyed, they must have looked like Forty-second Street and
Broadway compared to this Boca place. It still claimed 1300 inhabitants as estimated and
engraved on the stone court-house by the census-taker in 1597. The citizens were a mixture
of Indians and other Indians; but some of &lsquo;em was light- colored, which I was surprised to
see. The town was huddled up on the shore, with woods so thick around it that a
subpoena-server couldn&rsquo;t have reached a monkey ten yards away with the papers. We
wondered what kept it from being annexed to Kansas; but we soon found out that it was
Major Bing.
&ldquo;Major Bing was the ointment around the fly. He had the cochineal, sarsaparilla,
log-wood, annatto, hemp, and all other dye-woods and pure food adulteration concessions
cornered. He had five-sixths of the Boca de Thingama jiggers working for him on shares. It
was a beautiful graft. We used to brag about Morgan and E. H. and others of our wisest
when I was in the provinces&ndash;but now no more. That peninsula has got our little country
turned into a submarine without even the observation tower showing.
&ldquo;Major Bing&rsquo;s idea was this. He had the population go forth into the forest and gather
these products. When they brought &lsquo;em in he gave &lsquo;em one-fifth for their trouble.
Sometimes they&rsquo;d strike and demand a sixth. The Major always gave in to &lsquo;em.
&ldquo;The Major had a bungalow so close on the sea that the nine-inch tide seeped through
the cracks in the kitchen floor. Me and him and High Jack Snakefeeder sat on the porch and
drank rum from noon till midnight. He said he had piled up $300,000 in New Orleans banks,
and High and me could stay with him forever if we would. But High Jack happened to think
of the United States, and began to talk ethnology.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Ruins!&rsquo; says Major Bing. &lsquo;The woods are full of &lsquo;em. I don&rsquo;t know how far they date
back, but they was here before I came.&rsquo;
&ldquo;High Jack asks what form of worship the citizens of that locality are addicted to.&rdquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; says the Major, rubbing his nose, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t hardly say. I imagine it&rsquo;s infidel or Aztec
or Nonconformist or something like that. There&rsquo;s a church here&ndash;a Methodist or some other
kind&ndash;with a parson named Skidder. He claims to have converted the people to Christianity.
He and me don&rsquo;t assimilate except on state occasions. I imagine they worship some kind of
gods or idols yet. But Skidder says he has &lsquo;em in the fold.&rsquo;
&ldquo;A few days later High Jack and me, prowling around, strikes a plain path into the forest,
and follows it a good four miles. Then a branch turns to the left. We go a mile, maybe, down
that, and run up against the finest ruin you ever saw&ndash;solid stone with trees and vines and
under-brush all growing up against it and in it and through it. All over it was chiselled
carvings of funny beasts and people that would have been arrested if they&rsquo;d ever come out
in vaudeville that way. We approached it from the rear.
&ldquo;High Jack had been drinking too much rum ever since we landed in Boca. You know
how an Indian is&ndash;the palefaces fixed his clock when they introduced him to firewater. He&rsquo;d
brought a quart along with him.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Hunky,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll explore the ancient temple. It may be that the storin that
landed us here was propitious. The Minority Report Bureau of Ethnology,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;may yet
profit by the vagaries of wind and tide.&rsquo;
&ldquo;We went in the rear door of the bum edifice. We struck a kind of alcove without bath.
There was a granite davenport, and a stone wash- stand without any soap or exit for the
water, and some hardwood pegs drove into holes in the wall, and that was all. To go out of
that furnished apartment into a Harlem hall bedroom would make you feel like getting back
home from an amateur violoncello solo at an East Side Settlement house.
&ldquo;While High was examining some hieroglyphics on the wall that the stone-masons must
have made when their tools slipped, I stepped into the front room. That was at least thirty
by fifty feet, stone floor, six little windows like square port-holes that didn&rsquo;t let much light in.
&ldquo;I looked back over my shoulder, and sees High Jack&rsquo;s face three feet away.
&ldquo;&lsquo;High,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;of all the&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;And then I noticed he looked funny, and I turned around.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d taken off his clothes to the waist, and he didn&rsquo;t seem to hear me. I touched him,
and came near beating it. High Jack had turned to stone. I had been drinking some rum
myself.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Ossified!&rsquo; I says to him, loudly. &lsquo;I knew what would happen if you kept it up.&rsquo;&ldquo;And then High Jack comes in from the alcove when he hears me conversing with
nobody, and we have a look at Mr. Snakefeeder No. 2. It&rsquo;s a stone idol, or god, or revised
statute or something, and it looks as much like High Jack as one green pea looks like itself.
It&rsquo;s got exactly his face and size and color, but it&rsquo;s steadier on its pins. It stands on a kind of
rostrum or pedestal, and you can see it&rsquo;s been there ten million years.
&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a cousin of mine,&rsquo; sings High, and then he turns solemn.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Hunky,&rsquo; he says, putting one hand on my shoulder and one on the statue&rsquo;s, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in the
holy temple of my ancestors.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, if looks goes for anything,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve struck a twin. Stand side by side with
buddy, and let&rsquo;s see if there&rsquo;s any diff&rsquo;erence.&rsquo;
&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t. You know an Indian can keep his face as still as an iron dog&rsquo;s when he
wants to, so when High Jack froze his features you couldn&rsquo;t have told him from the other
one.
&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s some letters,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;on his nob&rsquo;s pedestal, but I can&rsquo;t make &lsquo;em out. The
alphabet of this country seems to be composed of sometimes a, e, I, o, and u, but generally
z&rsquo;s, l&rsquo;s, and t&rsquo;s.&rsquo;
&ldquo;High Jack&rsquo;s ethnology gets the upper hand of his rum for a minute, and he investigates
the inscription.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Hunky,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;this is a statue of Tlotopaxl, one of the most powerful gods of the
ancient Aztecs.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Glad to know him,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;but in his present condition he reminds me of the joke
Shakespeare got off on Julius Caesar. We might say about your friend:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Imperious what&rsquo;s-his-name, dead and tunied to stone&ndash;
No use to write or call him on the &lsquo;phone.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Hunky,&rsquo; says High Jack Snakefeeder, looking at me funny, &lsquo;do you believe in
reincarnation?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;It sounds to me,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;like either a clean-up of the slaughter- houses or a new kind
of Boston pink. I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;that I am the reincarnation of Tlotopaxl. My researches have
convinced me that the Cherokees, of all the North American tribes, can boast of the
straightest descent from the proud Aztec race. That,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;was a favorite theory of mine
and Florence Blue Feather&rsquo;s. And she&ndash;what&rsquo; if she&ndash;!&lsquo;&ldquo;High Jack grabs my arm and walls his eyes at me. Just then he looked more like his
eminent co-Indian murderer, Crazy Horse.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;what if she, what if she, what if she? You&rsquo;re drunk,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Impersonating
idols and believing in&ndash;what was it ?- -recarnalization? Let&rsquo;s have a drink,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s as
spooky here as a Brooklyn artificial-limb factory at midnight with the gas turned down.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Just then I heard somebody coming, and I dragged High Jack into the bedless
bedchamber. There was peep-holes bored through the wall, so we could see the whole front
part of the temple.
Major Bing told me afterward that the ancient priests in charge used to rubber through
them at the congregation.
&ldquo;In a few minutes an old Indian woman came in with a&rsquo; big oval earthen dish full of grub.
She set it on a square block of stone in front of the graven image, and laid down and
walloped her face on the floor a few times, and then took a walk for herself.
&ldquo;High Jack and me was hungry, so we came out and looked it over. There was goat
steaks and fried rice-cakes, and plantains and cassava, and broiled land-crabs and
mangoes&ndash;nothing like what you get at Chubb&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;We ate hearty&ndash;and had another round of rum.
&ldquo;&lsquo;It must be old Tecumseh&rsquo;s&ndash;or whatever you call him&ndash;birthday,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Or do they
feed him every day? I thought gods only drank vanilla on Mount Catawampus.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Then some more native parties in short kimonos that showed their aboriginees
punctured the near-horizon, and me and High had to skip back into Father Axletree&rsquo;s private
boudoir. They came by ones, twos, and threes, and left all sorts of offerings&ndash;there was
enough grub for Bingham&rsquo;s nine gods of war, with plenty left over for the Peace Conference
at The Hague. They brought jars of honey, and bunches of bananas, and bottles of wine, and
stacks of tortillas, and beautiful shawls worth one hundred dollars apiece that the Indian
women weave of a kind of vegetable fibre like silk. All of &lsquo;em got down and wriggled on the
floor in front of that hard-finish god, and then sneaked off through the woods again.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I wonder who gets this rake-off?&rsquo; remarks High Jack.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s priests or deputy idols or a committee of disarrangements
somewhere in the woods on the job. Wherever you find a god you&rsquo;ll find somebody waiting
to take charge of the burnt offerings.&lsquo;&ldquo;And then we took another swig of rum and walked out to the parlor front door to cool
off, for it was as hot inside as a summer camp on the Palisades.
&ldquo;And while we stood there in the breeze we looks down the path and sees a young lady
approaching the blasted ruin. She was bare-footed and had on a white robe, and carried a
wreath of white flowers in her hand. When she got nearer we saw she had a long blue
feather stuck through her black hair. And when she got nearer still me and High Jack
Snakefeeder grabbed each other to keep from tumbling down on the floor; for the girl&rsquo;s face
was as much like Florence Blue Feather&rsquo;s as his was like old King Toxicology&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;And then was when High Jack&rsquo;s booze drowned his system of ethnology. He dragged
me inside back of the statue, and says:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Lay hold of it, Hunky. We&rsquo;ll pack it into the other room. I felt it all the time,&rsquo; says he.
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m the reconsideration of the god Locomotorataxia, and Florence Blue Feather was my
bride a thousand years ago. She has come to seek me in the temple where I used to reign.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no use arguing against the rum question. You take his feet.&rsquo;
&ldquo;We lifted the three-hundred-pound stone god, and carried him into the back room of
the cafe&ndash;the temple, I mean&ndash;and leaned him against the wall. It was more work than
bouncing three live ones from an all- night Broadway joint on New-Year&rsquo;s Eve.
&ldquo;Then High Jack ran out and brought in a couple of them Indian silk shawls and began
to undress himself.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, figs!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Is it thus? Strong drink is an adder and subtractor, too. Is it the heat
or the call of the wild that&rsquo;s got you ?&rsquo;
&ldquo;But High Jack is too full of exaltation and cane-juice to reply. He stops the disrobing
business just short of the Manhattan Beach rules, and then winds them red-and-white
shawls around him, and goes out and. stands on the pedestal as steady as any platinum
deity you ever saw. And I looks through a peek-hole to see what he is up to.
&ldquo;In a few minutes in comes the girl with the flower wreath. Danged if I wasn&rsquo;t knocked a
little silly when she got close, she looked so exactly much like Florence Blue Feather. &lsquo;I
wonder,&rsquo; says I to myself, &lsquo;if she has been reincarcerated, too? If I could see,&rsquo; says I to myself,
&lsquo;whether she has a mole on her left&ndash;&rsquo; But the next minute I thought she looked one-eighth
of a shade darker than Florence; but she looked good at that. And High Jack hadn&rsquo;t drunk all
the rum that had been drank.
&ldquo;The girl went up within ten feet of the bum idol, and got down and massaged her nose
with the floor, like the rest did. Then she went nearer and laid the flower wreath on the
block of stone at High Jack&rsquo;s feet. Rummy as I was, I thought it was kind of nice of her tothink of offering flowers instead of household and kitchen provisions. Even a stone god
ought to appreciate a little sentiment like that on top of the fancy groceries they had piled
up in front of him.
&ldquo;And then High Jack steps down from his pedestal, quiet, and mentions a few words
that sounded just like the hieroglyphics carved on the walls of the ruin. The girl gives a little
jump backward, and her eyes fly open as big as doughnuts; but she don&rsquo;t beat it.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t she? I&rsquo;ll tell you why I think why. It don&rsquo;t seem to a girl so supernatural,
unlikely, strange, and startling that a stone god should come to life for her. If he was to do it
for one of them snub-nosed brown girls on the other side of the woods, now, it would be
different&ndash;but her! I&rsquo;ll bet she said to herself:
&lsquo;Well, goodness me! you&rsquo;ve been a long time getting on your job. I&rsquo;ve half a mind not to
speak to you.&rsquo;
&ldquo;But she and High Jack holds hands and walks away out of the temple together. By the
time I&rsquo;d had time to take another drink and enter upon the scene they was twenty yards
away, going up the path in the woods that the girl had come down. With the natural scenery
already in place, it was just like a play to watch &lsquo;em&ndash;she looking up at him, and him giving
her back the best that an Indian can hand, out in the way of a goo-goo eye. But there wasn&rsquo;t
anything in that recarnification and revulsion to tintype for me.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Hey! Injun!&rsquo; I yells out to High Jack.
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got a board-bill due in town, and you&rsquo;re leaving me without a cent. Brace up and
cut out the Neapolitan fisher-maiden, and let&rsquo;s go back home.&rsquo;
&ldquo;But on the two goes; without looking once back until, as you might say, the forest
swallowed &lsquo;em up. And I never saw or heard of High Jack Snakefeeder from that day to this. I
don&rsquo;t know if the Cherokees came from the Aspics; but if they did, one of &lsquo;em went back.
&ldquo;All I could do was to hustle back to that Boca place and panhandle Major Bing. He
detached himself from enough of his winnings to buy me a ticket home. And I&rsquo;m back again
on the job at Chubb&rsquo;s, sir, and I&rsquo;m going to hold it steady. Come round, and you&rsquo;ll find the
steaks as good as ever.&rdquo;
I wondered what Hunky Magee thought about his own story; so I asked him if he had
any theories about reincarnation and transmogrification and such mysteries as he had
touched upon.
&ldquo;Nothing like that,&rdquo; said Hunky, positively. &ldquo;What ailed High Jack was too much booze
and education. They&rsquo;ll do an Indian up every time.&ldquo;&ldquo;But what about Miss Blue Feather?&rdquo; I persisted.
&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Hunky, with a grin, &ldquo;that little lady that stole High Jack certainly did give me
a jar when I first took a look at her, but it was only for a minute. You remember I told you
High Jack said that Miss Florence Blue Feather disappeared from home about a year ago?
Well, where she landed four days later was in as neat a five-room flat on East Twenty-third
Street as you ever walked sideways through&ndash;and she&rsquo;s been Mrs. Magee ever since.&rdquo;
The Head-Hunter （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>When the war between Spain and George Dewey was over, I went to the Philippine
Islands. There I remained as bushwhacker correspondent for my paper until its managing
editor notified me that an eight-hundred- word cablegram describing the grief of a pet
carabao over the death of an infant Moro was not considered by the office to be war news.
So I resigned, and came home.
On board the trading-vessel that brought me back I pondered much upon the strange
things I had sensed in the weird archipelago of the yellow-brown people. The manoeuvres
and skirmishings of the petty war interested me not: I was spellbound by the outlandish and
unreadable countenance of that race that had turned its expressionless gaze upon us out of
an unguessable past.
Particularly during my stay in Mindanao had I been fascinated and attracted by that
delightfully original tribe of heathen known as the head-hunters. Those grim, flinty,
relentless little men, never seen, but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of
their concealed presence, paralleling the trail of their prey through unmapped forests,
across perilous mountain-tops, adown bottomless chasms, into uninhabitable jungles,
always near with the invisible hand of death uplifted, betraying their pursuit only by such
signs as a beast or a bird or a gliding serpent might make-a twig crackling in the awful,
sweat-soaked night, a drench of dew showering from the screening foliage of a giant tree, a
whisper at even from the rushes of a water-level-a hint of death for every mile and every
hour-they amused me greatly, those little fellows of one idea.
When you think of it, their method is beautifully and almost hilariously effective and
simple.
You have your hut in which you live and carry out the destiny that was decreed for you.
Spiked to the jamb of your bamboo doorway is a basket made of green withes, plaited. From
time to time, as vanity or ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move you, you creep
forth with your snickersnee and take up the silent trail. Back from it you come, triumphant,
bearing the severed, gory head of your victim, which you deposit with pardonable pride in
the basket at the side of your door. It may be the head of your enemy, your friend, or astranger, according as competition, jealousy, or simple sportiveness has been your incentive
to labor.
In any case, your reward is certain. The village men, in passing, stop to congratulate you,
as your neighbor on weaker planes of life stops to admire and praise the begonias in your
front yard. Your particular brown maid lingers, with fluttering bosom, casting soft tiger&rsquo;s eyes
at the evidence of your love for her. You chew betel-nut and listen, content, to the
intermittent soft drip from the ends of the severed neck arteries. And you show your teeth
and grunt like a water-buffalo&ndash;which is as near as you can come to laughing-at the thought
that the cold, acephalous body of your door ornament is being spotted by wheeling vultures
in the Mindanaoan wilds.
Truly, the life of the merry head-hunter captivated me. He had reduced art and
philosophy to a simple code. To take your adversary&rsquo;s head, to basket it at the portal of your
castle, to see it lying there, a dead thing, with its cunning and stratagems and power gone&ndash;
Is there a better way to foil his plots, to refute his arguments, to establish your superiority
over his skill and wisdom?
The ship that brought me home was captained by an erratic Swede, who changed his
course and deposited me, with genuine compassion, in a small town on the Pacific coast of
one of the Central American republics, a few hundred miles south of the port to which he
had engaged to convey me. But I was wearied of movement and exotic fancies; so I leaped
contentedly upon the firm sands of the village of Mojada, telling myself I should be sure to
find there the rest that I craved. After all, far better to linger there (I thought), lulled by the
sedative plash of the waves and the rustling of palm-fronds, than to sit upon the horsehair
sofa of my parental home in the East, and there, cast down by currant wine and cake, and
scourged by fatuous relatives, drivel into the ears of gaping neighbors sad stories of the
death of colonial governors.
When I first saw Chloe Greene she was standing, all in white, in the doorway of her
father&rsquo;s tile-roofed &lsquo;dobe house. She was polishing a silver cup with a cloth, and she looked
like a pearl laid against black velvet. She turned on me a flatteringly protracted but a
wiltingly disapproving gaze, and then went inside, humming a light song to indicate the
value she placed upon my existence.
Small wonder: for Dr. Stamford (the most disreputable professional man between
Juneau and Valparaiso) and I were zigzagging along the turfy street, tunelessly singing the
words of Auld Lang Syne to the air of Muzzer&rsquo;s Little Coal-Black Coon. We had come from
the ice factory, which was Mojada&rsquo;s palace of wickedness, where we had been playing
billiards and opening black bottles, white with frost, that we dragged with strings out of old
Sandoval&rsquo;s ice-cold vats.
I turned in sudden rage to Dr. Stamford, as sober as the verger of a cathedral. In a
moment I had become aware that we were swine cast before a pearl.&ldquo;You beast,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this is half your doing. And the other half is the fault of this cursed
country. I&rsquo;d better have gone back to Sleepy-town and died in a wild orgy of currant wine
and buns than to have had this happen.&rdquo;
Stamford filled the empty street with his roaring laughter.
&ldquo;You too!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;And all as quick as the popping of a cork. Well, she does seem to
strike agreeably upon the retina. But don&rsquo;t burn your fingers. All Mojada will tell you that
Louis Devoe is the man.
&ldquo;We will see about that,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And, perhaps, whether he is a man as well as the
man.&rdquo;
I lost no time in meeting Louis Devoe. That was easily accomplished, for the foreign
colony in Mojada numbered scarce a dozen; and they gathered daily at a half-decent hotel
kept by a Turk, where they managed to patch together the fluttering rags of country and
civilization that were left them. I sought Devoe before I did my pearl of the doorway,
because I had learned a little of the game of war, and knew better than to strike for a prize
before testing the strength of the enemy.
A sort of cold dismay-something akin to fear-filled me when I had estimated him. I
found a man so perfectly poised, so charming, so deeply learned in the world&rsquo;s rituals, so full
of tact, courtesy, and hospitality, so endowed with grace and ease and a kind of careless,
haughty power that I almost overstepped the bounds in probing him, in turning him on the
spit to find the weak point that I so craved for him to have. But I left him whole-I had to
make bitter acknowledgment to myself that Louis Devoe was a gentleman worthy of my best
blows; and I swore to give him them. He was a great merchant of the country, a wealthy
importer and exporter. All day he sat in a fastidiously appointed office, surrounded by works
of art and evidences of his high culture, directing through glass doors and windows the
affairs of his house.
In person he was slender and hardly tall. His small, well-shaped head was covered with
thick, brown hair, trimmed short, and he wore a thick, brown beard also cut close and to a
fine point. His manners were a pattern.
Before long I had become a regular and a welcome visitor at the Greene home. I shook
my wild habits from me like a worn-out cloak. I trained for the conflict with the care of a
prize-fighter and the self-denial of a Brahmin.
As for Chloe Greene, I shall weary you with no sonnets to her eyebrow. She was a
splendidly feminine girl, as wholesome as a November pippin, and no more mysterious than
a windowpane. She had whimsical little theories that she had deduced from life, and thatfitted the maxims of Epictetus like princess gowns. I wonder, after all, if that old duffer
wasn&rsquo;t rather wise!
Chloe had a father, the Reverend Homer Greene, and an intermittent mother, who
sometimes palely presided over a twilight teapot. The Reverend Homer was a burr-like man
with a life-work. He was writing a concordance to the Scriptures, and had arrived as far as
Kings. Being, presumably, a suitor for his daughter&rsquo;s hand, I was timber for his literary
outpourings. I had the family tree of Israel drilled into my head until I used to cry aloud in
my sleep: &ldquo;And Aminadab begat Jay Eye See,&rdquo; and so forth, until he had tackled another
book. I once made a calculation that the Reverend Homer&rsquo;s concordance would be worked
up as far as the Seven Vials mentioned in Revelations about the third day after they were
opened.
Louis Devoe, as well as I, was a visitor and an intimate friend of the Greenes. It was
there I met him the oftenest, and a more agreeable&rsquo; man or a more accomplished I have
never hated in my life.
Luckily or unfortunately, I came to be accepted as a Boy. My appearance was youthful,
and I suppose I had that pleading and homeless air that always draws the motherliness that
is in women and the cursed theories and hobbies of pater-familiases.
Chloe called me &ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; and made sisterly fun of my attempts to woo her. With
Devoe she was vastly more reserved. He was the man of romance, one to stir her
imagination and deepest feelings had her fancy leaned toward him. I was closer to her, but
standing in no glamour; I had the task before me of winning her in what seems to me the
American way of fighting&ndash;with cleanness and pluck and everyday devotion to break away
the barriers of friendship that divided us, and to take her, if I could, between sunrise and
dark, abetted by neither moonlight nor music nor foreign wiles.
Chloe gave no sign of bestowing her blithe affections upon either of us. But one day she
let out to me an inkling of what she preferred in a man. It was tremendously interesting to
me, but not illuminating as to its application. I had been tormenting her for the dozenth
time with the statement and catalogue of my sentiments toward her.
&ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a man to show his love for me by leading an army
against another country and blowing people off the earth with cannons.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If you mean that the opposite way,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;as they say women do, I&rsquo;ll see what I
can do. The papers are full of this diplomatic row in Russia. My people know some big
people in Washington who are right next to the army people, and I could get an artillery
commission and&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that way,&rdquo; interrupted Chloe. &ldquo;I mean what I say. It isn&rsquo;t the big things that are
done in the world, Tommy, that count with a woman. When the knights were riding abroadin their armor to slay dragons, many a stay-at-home page won a lonesome lady&rsquo;s hand by
being on the spot to pick up her glove and be quick with her cloak when the wind blew. The
man I am to like best, whoever he shall be, must show his love in little ways. He must never
forget, after hearing it once, that I do not like to have any one walk at my left side; that I
detest bright-colored neckties; that I prefer to sit with my back to a light; that I like candied
violets; that I must not be talked to when I am looking at the moonlight shining on water,
and that I very, very often long for dates stuffed with English walnuts.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Frivolity,&rdquo; I said, with a frown. &ldquo;Any well-trained servant would be equal to such
details.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And he must remember,&rdquo; went on Chloe, to remind me of what I want when I do not
know, myself, what I want.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rising in the scale,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What you seem to need is a first-class clairvoyant.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And if I say that I am dying to hear a Beethoven sonata, and stamp my foot when I say
it, he must know by that that what my soul craves is salted almonds; and he will have them
ready in his pocket.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am at a loss. I do not know whether your soul&rsquo;s affinity is to be an
impresario or a fancy grocer.&rdquo;
Chole turned her pearly smile upon me.
&ldquo;Take less than half of what I said as a jest,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t think too lightly of
the little things, Boy. Be a paladin if you must, but don&rsquo;t let it show on you. Most women are
only very big children, and most men are only very little ones. Please us; don&rsquo;t try to
overpower us. When we want a hero we can make one out of even a plain grocer the third
time he catches our handkerchief before it falls to the ground.&rdquo;
That evening I was taken down with pernicious fever. That is a kind of coast fever with
improvements and high-geared attachments. Your temperature goes up among the threes
and fours and remains there, laughing scornfully and feverishly at the cinchona trees and the
coal- tar derivatives. Pernicious fever is a case for a simple mathematician instead of a doctor.
It is merely this formula: Vitality + the desire to live&ndash;the duration of the fever the result.
I took to my bed in the two-roomed thatched hut where I had been comfortably
established, and sent for a gallon of rum. That was not for myself. Drunk, Stamford was the
best doctor between the Andes and the Pacific. He came, sat at my bedside, and drank
himself into condition.
&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my lily-white and reformed Romeo, medicine will do you no good.
But I will give you quinine, which, being bitter, will arouse in you hatred and anger-twostimulants that will add ten per cent. to your chances. You are as strong as a caribou calf,
and you will get well if the fever doesn&rsquo;t get in a knockout blow when you&rsquo;re off your guard.&rdquo;
For two weeks I lay on my back feeling like a Hindoo widow on a burning ghat. Old
Atasca, an untrained Indian nurse, sat near the door like a petrified statue of What&rsquo;s-the-Use,
attending to her duties, which were, mainly, to see that time went by without slipping a cog.
Sometimes I would fancy myself back in the Philippines, or, at worse times, sliding off the
horsehair sofa in Sleepytown.
One afternoon I ordered Atasca to vamose, and got up and dressed carefully. I took my
temperature, which I was pleased to find 104. I paid almost dainty attention to my dress,
choosing solicitously a necktie of a dull and subdued hue. The mirror showed that I was
looking little the worse from my illness. The fever gave brightness to my eyes and color to
my face. And while I looked at my reflection my color went and came again as I thought of
Chloe Greene and the millions of eons that had passed since I&rsquo;d seen her, and of Louis Devoe
and the time he had gained on me.
I went straight to her house. I seemed to float rather than walk; I hardly felt the ground
under my feet; I thought pernicious fever must be a great boon to make one feel so strong.
I found Chloe and Louis Devoe sitting under the awning in front of the house. She
jumped up and met me with a double handshake.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, glad, glad to see you out again!&rdquo; she cried, every word a pearl strung on the
string of her sentence. &ldquo;You are well, Tommy&ndash;or better, of course. I wanted to come to see
you, but they wouldn&rsquo;t let me.
&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said I, carelessly, &ldquo;it was nothing. Merely a little fever. I am out again, as you
see.&rdquo;
We three sat there and talked for half an hour or so. Then Chloe looked out yearningly
and almost piteously across the ocean. I could see in her sea-blue eyes some deep and
intense desire. Devoe, curse him! saw it too.
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; we asked, in unison.
&ldquo;Cocoanut-pudding,&rdquo; said Chloe, pathetically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted some&ndash;oh, so badly, for two
days. It&rsquo;s got beyond a wish; it&rsquo;s an obsession.
&ldquo;The cocoanut season is over,&rdquo; said Devoe, in that voice of his that gave thrilling
interest to his most commonplace words. &ldquo;I hardly think one could be found in Mojada. The
natives never use them except when they are green and the milk is fresh. They sell all the
ripe ones to the fruiterers.&ldquo;&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t a broiled lobster or a Welsh rabbit do as well?&rdquo; I remarked, with the
engaging idiocy of a pernicious-fever convalescent.
Chloe came as near to pouting as a sweet disposition and a perfect profile would allow
her to come.
The Reverend Homer poked his ermine-lined face through the doorway and added a
concordance to the conversation.
&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;old Campos keeps the dried nuts in his little store on the hill.
But it would be far better, my daughter, to restrain unusual desires, and partake thankfully of
the daily dishes that the Lord has set before us.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Stuff!&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo; asked the Reverend Homer, sharply.
&ldquo;I say it&rsquo;s tough,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to drop into the vernacular, that Miss Greene should be
deprived of the food she desires-a simple thing like kalsomine-pudding. Perhaps,&rdquo; I
continued, solicitously, &ldquo;some pickled walnuts or a fricassee of Hungarian butternuts would
do as well.&rdquo;
Every one looked at me with a slight exhibition of curiosity.
Louis Devoe arose and made his adieus. I watched him until he had sauntered slowly
and grandiosely to the corner, around which he turned to reach his great warehouse and
store. Chloe made her excuses, and went inside for a few minutes to attend to some detail
affecting the seven-o&rsquo;clock dinner. She was a passed mistress in housekeeping. I had tasted
her puddings and bread with beatitude.
When all had gone, I turned casually and saw a basket made of plaited green withes
hanging by a nail outside the door-jamb. With a rush that made my hot temples throb there
came vividly to my mind recollections of the head-hunters&ndash;those grim, flinty, relentless little
men, never seen, but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of their concealed
presence&hellip; . From time to time, as vanity or ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may
move him, one creeps forth with his snickersnee and takes up the silent trail&hellip; . Back he
comes, triumphant, bearing the severed, gory head of his victim &hellip; His particular brown or
white maid lingers, with fluttering bosom, casting soft tiger&rsquo;s eyes at the evidence of his love
for her.
I stole softly from the house and returned to my hut. From its supporting nails in the
wall I took a machete as heavy as a butcher&rsquo;s cleaver and sharper than a safety-razor. And
then I chuckled softly to myself, and set out to the fastidiously appointed private office of
Monsieur Louis Devoe, usurper to the hand of the Pearl of the Pacific.He was never slow at thinking; he gave one look at my face and another at the weapon
in my hand as I entered his door, and then he seemed to fade from my sight. I ran to the
back door, kicked it open, and saw him running like a deer up the road toward the wood that
began two hundred yards away. I was after him, with a shout. I remember hearing children
and women screaming, and seeing them flying from the road.
He was fleet, but I was stronger. A mile, and I had almost come up with him. He
doubled cunningly and dashed into a brake that extended into a small canon. I crashed
through this after him, and in five minutes had him cornered in an angle of insurmountable
cliffs. There his instinct of self-preservation steadied him, as it will steady even animals at
bay. He turned to me, quite calm, with a ghastly smile.
&ldquo;Oh, Rayburn!&rdquo; he said, with such an awful effort at ease that I was impolite enough to
laugh rudely in his face. &ldquo;Oh, Rayburn!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;come, let&rsquo;s have done with this nonsense.
Of course, I know it&rsquo;s the fever and you&rsquo;re not yourself; but collect yourself, man-give me
that ridiculous weapon, now, and let&rsquo;s go back and talk it over.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I will go back,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;carrying your head with me. We will see how charmingly it can
discourse when it lies in the basket at her door.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, persuasively, &ldquo;I think better of you than to suppose that you try this
sort of thing as a joke. But even the vagaries of a fever-crazed lunatic come some time to a
limit. What is this talk about heads and baskets? Get yourself together and throw away that
absurd cane-chopper. What would Miss Greene think of you?&rdquo; he ended, with the silky
cajolery that one would use toward a fretful child.
&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;At last you have struck upon the right note. What would she think of
me? Listen,&rdquo; I repeated.
&ldquo;There are women,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;who look upon horsehair sofas and currant wine as dross.
To them even the calculated modulation of your well- trimmed talk sounds like the dropping
of rotten plums from a tree in the night. They are the maidens who walk back and forth in
the villages, scorning the emptiness of the baskets at the doors of the young men who
would win them.
One such as they,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is waiting. Only a fool would try to win a woman by drooling
like a braggart in her doorway or by waiting upon her whims like a footman. They are all
daughters of Herodias, and to gain their hearts one must lay the heads of his enemies before
them with his own hands. Now, bend your neck, Louis Devoe. Do not be a coward as well as
a chatterer at a lady&rsquo;s tea-table.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There, there!&rdquo; said Devoe, falteringly. &ldquo;You know me, don&rsquo;t you, Rayburn?&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I know you. I know you. I know you. But the basket is empty. The old
men of the village and the young men, and both the dark maidens and the ones who are as
fair as pearls walk back and forth and see its emptiness. Will you kneel now, or must we
have a scuffle? It is not like you to make things go roughly and with bad form. But the basket
is waiting for your head.&rdquo;
With that he went to pieces. I had to catch him as he tried to scamper past me like a
scared rabbit. I stretched him out and got a foot on his chest, but he squirmed like a worm,
although I appealed repeatedly to his sense of propriety and the duty he owed to himself as
a gentleman not to make a row.
But at last he gave me the chance, and I swung the machete.
It was not hard work. He flopped like a chicken during the six or seven blows that it
took to sever his head; but finally he lay still, and I tied his head in my handkerchief. The eyes
opened and shut thrice while I walked a hundred yards. I was red to my feet with the drip,
but what did that matter? With delight I felt under my hands the crisp touch of his short,
thick, brown hair and close-trimmed beard.
I reached the house of the Greenes and dumped the head of Louis Devoe into the
basket that still hung by the nail in the door-jamb. I sat in a chair under the awning and
waited. The sun was within two hours of setting. Chloe came out and looked surprised.
&ldquo;Where have you been, Tommy?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You were gone when I came out.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Look in the basket,&rdquo; I said, rising to my feet. She looked, and gave a little scream&ndash;of
delight, I was pleased to note.
&ldquo;Oh, Tommy!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was just what I wanted you to do. It&rsquo;s leaking a little, but
that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Wasn&rsquo;t I telling you? It&rsquo;s the little things that count. And you
remembered.&rdquo;
Little things! She held the ensanguined head of Louis Devoe in her white apron. Tiny
streams of red widened on her apron and dripped upon the floor. Her face was bright and
tender.
&ldquo;Little things, indeed!&rdquo; I thought again. &ldquo;The head-hunters are right. These are the
things that women like you to do for them.&rdquo;
Chloe came close to me. There was no one in sight. She looked tip at me with sea-blue
eyes that said things they had never said before.&ldquo;You think of me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are the man I was describing. You think of the little
things, and they are what make the world worth living in. The man for me must consider my
little wishes, and make me happy in small ways. He must bring me little red peaches in
December if I wish for them, and then I will love him till June. I will have no knight in armor
slaying his rival or killing dragons for me. You please me very well, Tommy.&rdquo;
I stooped and kissed her. Then a moisture broke out on my forehead, and I began to
feel weak. I saw the red stains vanish from Chloe&rsquo;s apron, and the head of Louis Devoe turn
to a brown, dried cocoanut.
&ldquo;There will be cocoanut-pudding for dinner, Tommy, boy,&rdquo; said Chloe, gayly, &ldquo;and you
must come. I must go in for a little while.&rdquo;
She vanished in a delightful flutter.
Dr. Stamford tramped up hurriedly. He seized my pulse as though it were his own
property that I had escaped with.
&ldquo;You are the biggest fool outside of any asylum!&rdquo; he said, angrily. &ldquo;Why did you leave
your bed? And the idiotic things you&rsquo;ve been doing!&ndash;and no wonder, with your pulse going
like a sledge-hammer.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Name some of them,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Devoe sent for me,&rdquo; said Stamford. &ldquo;He saw you from his window go to old Campos&rsquo;
store, chase him up the hill with his own yardstick, and then come back and make off with
his biggest cocoanut.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the little things that count, after all,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your little bed that counts with you just now,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;You come with me
at once, or I&rsquo;ll throw up the case. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re as loony as a loon.&rdquo;
So I got no cocoanut-pudding that evening, but I conceived a distrust as to the value of
the method of the head-hunters. Perhaps for many centuries the maidens of the villages
may have been looking wistfully at the heads in the baskets at the doorways, longing for
other and lesser trophies.
Hearts and Crosses （O·Henry）
___________________________________________Baldy Woods reached for the bottle, and got it. Whenever Baldy went for anything he
usually&ndash;but this is not Baldy&rsquo;s story. He poured out a third drink that was larger by a finger
than the first and second. Baldy was in consultation; and the consultee is worthy of his hire.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be king if I was you,&rdquo; said Baldy, so positively that his holster creaked and his spurs
rattled.
Webb Yeager pushed back his flat-brimmed Stetson, and made further disorder in his
straw-coloured hair. The tonsorial recourse being without avail, he followed the liquid
example of the more resourceful Baldy.
&ldquo;If a man marries a queen, it oughtn&rsquo;t to make him a two-spot,&rdquo; declared Webb,
epitomising his grievances.
&ldquo;Sure not,&rdquo; said Baldy, sympathetic, still thirsty, and genuinely solicitous concerning the
relative value of the cards. &ldquo;By rights you&rsquo;re a king. If I was you, I&rsquo;d call for a new deal. The
cards have been stacked on you&ndash;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you are, Webb Yeager.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Webb, with a hopeful look in his pale-blue eyes.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a prince-consort.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Go easy,&rdquo; said Webb. &ldquo;I never blackguarded you none.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a title,&rdquo; explained Baldy, &ldquo;up among the picture-cards; but it don&rsquo;t take no tricks. I&rsquo;ll
tell you, Webb. It&rsquo;s a brand they&rsquo;re got for certain animals in Europe. Say that you or me or
one of them Dutch dukes marries in a royal family. Well, by and by our wife gets to be queen.
Are we king? Not in a million years. At the coronation ceremonies we march between little
casino and the Ninth Grand Custodian of the Royal Hall Bedchamber. The only use we are is
to appear in photographs, and accept the responsibility for the heir- apparent. That ain&rsquo;t any
square deal. Yes, sir, Webb, you&rsquo;re a prince- consort; and if I was you, I&rsquo;d start a interregnum
or a habeus corpus or somethin&rsquo;; and I&rsquo;d be king if I had to turn from the bottom of the
deck.&rdquo;
Baldy emptied his glass to the ratification of his Warwick pose.
&ldquo;Baldy,&rdquo; said Webb, solemnly, &ldquo;me and you punched cows in the same outfit for years.
We been runnin&rsquo; on the same range, and ridin&rsquo; the same trails since we was boys. I wouldn&rsquo;t
talk about my family affairs to nobody but you. You was line-rider on the Nopalito Ranch
when I married Santa McAllister. I was foreman then; but what am I now? I don&rsquo;t amount to
a knot in a stake rope.&rdquo;
&ldquo;When old McAllister was the cattle king of West Texas,&rdquo; continued Baldy with Satanic
sweetness, &ldquo;you was some tallow. You had as much to say on the ranch as he did.&rdquo;&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; admitted Webb, &ldquo;up to the time he found out I was tryin&rsquo; to get my rope over
Santa&rsquo;s head. Then he kept me out on the range as far from the ranch-house as he could.
When the old man died they commenced to call Santa the &lsquo;cattle queen.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m boss of the
cattle&ndash;that&rsquo;s all. She &lsquo;tends to all the business; she handles all the money; I can&rsquo;t sell even a
beef-steer to a party of campers, myself. Santa&rsquo;s the &lsquo;queen&rsquo;; and I&rsquo;m Mr. Nobody.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be king if I was you,&rdquo; repeated Baldy Woods, the royalist. &ldquo;When a man marries a
queen he ought to grade up with her&ndash;on the hoof&ndash; dressed&ndash;dried&ndash;corned&ndash;any old way
from the chaparral to the packing- house. Lots of folks thinks it&rsquo;s funny, Webb, that you don&rsquo;t
have the say-so on the Nopalito. I ain&rsquo;t reflectin&rsquo; none on Miz Yeager&ndash;she&rsquo;s the finest little
lady between the Rio Grande and next Christmas&ndash;but a man ought to be boss of his own
camp.&rdquo;
The smooth, brown face of Yeager lengthened to a mask of wounded melancholy. With
that expression, and his rumpled yellow hair and guileless blue eyes, he might have been
likened to a schoolboy whose leadership had been usurped by a youngster of superior
strength. But his active and sinewy seventy-two inches, and his girded revolvers forbade the
comparison.
&ldquo;What was that you called me, Baldy?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What kind of a concert was it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;A &lsquo;consort,&rsquo;&rdquo; corrected Baldy&ndash;&ldquo;a &lsquo;prince-consort.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a kind of short-card pseudonym.
You come in sort of between Jack-high and a four-card flush.&rdquo;
Webb Yeager sighed, and gathered the strap of his Winchester scabbard from the floor.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ridin&rsquo; back to the ranch to-day,&rdquo; he said half-heartedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to start a bunch of
beeves for San Antone in the morning.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your company as far as Dry Lake,&rdquo; announced Baldy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a round-up camp on
the San Marcos cuttin&rsquo; out two-year-olds.&rdquo;
The two companeros mounted their ponies and trotted away from the little railroad
settlement, where they had foregathered in the thirsty morning.
At Dry Lake, where their routes diverged, they reined up for a parting cigarette. For
miles they had ridden in silence save for the soft drum of the ponies&rsquo; hoofs on the matted
mesquite grass, and the rattle of the chaparral against their wooden stirrups. But in Texas
discourse is seldom continuous. You may fill in a mile, a meal, and a murder between your
paragraphs without detriment to your thesis. So, without apology, Webb offered an
addendum to the conversation that had begun ten miles away.&ldquo;You remember, yourself, Baldy, that there was a time when Santa wasn&rsquo;t quite so
independent. You remember the days when old McAllister was keepin&rsquo; us apart, and how
she used to send me the sign that she wanted to see me? Old man Mac promised to make
me look like a colander if I ever come in gun-shot of the ranch. You remember the sign she
used to send, Baldy&ndash;the heart with a cross inside of it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; cried Baldy, with intoxicated archness. &ldquo;You old sugar-stealing coyote! Don&rsquo;t I
remember! Why, you dad-blamed old long-horned turtle- dove, the boys in camp was all
cognoscious about them hiroglyphs. The &lsquo;gizzard-and-crossbones&rsquo; we used to call it. We used
to see &lsquo;em on truck that was sent out from the ranch. They was marked in charcoal on the
sacks of flour and in lead-pencil on the newspapers. I see one of &lsquo;em once chalked on the
back of a new cook that old man McAllister sent out from the ranch&ndash;danged if I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Santa&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; explained Webb gently, &ldquo;got her to promise that she wouldn&rsquo;t write to
me or send me any word. That heart-and-cross sign was her scheme. Whenever she wanted
to see me in particular she managed to put that mark on somethin&rsquo; at the ranch that she
knew I&rsquo;d see. And I never laid eyes on it but what I burnt the wind for the ranch the same
night. I used to see her in that coma mott back of the little horse-corral.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We knowed it,&rdquo; chanted Baldy; &ldquo;but we never let on. We was all for you. We knowed
why you always kept that fast paint in camp. And when we see that gizzard-and-crossbones
figured out on the truck from the ranch we knowed old Pinto was goin&rsquo; to eat up miles that
night instead of grass. You remember Scurry&ndash;that educated horse-wrangler we had&ndash; the
college fellow that tangle-foot drove to the range? Whenever Scurry saw that
come-meet-your-honey brand on anything from the ranch, he&rsquo;d wave his hand like that, and
say, &lsquo;Our friend Lee Andrews will again swim the Hell&rsquo;s point to-night.&rsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;The last time Santa sent me the sign,&rdquo; said Webb, &ldquo;was once when she was sick. I
noticed it as soon as I hit camp, and I galloped Pinto forty mile that night. She wasn&rsquo;t at the
coma mott. I went to the house; and old McAllister met me at the door. &lsquo;Did you come here
to get killed?&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll disoblige you for once. I just started a Mexican to bring you. Santa
wants you. Go in that room and see her. And then come out here and see me.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Santa was lyin&rsquo; in bed pretty sick. But she gives out a kind of a smile, and her hand and
mine lock horns, and I sets down by the bed&ndash; mud and spurs and chaps and all. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard
you ridin&rsquo; across the grass for hours, Webb,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;I was sure you&rsquo;d come. You saw the
sign?&rsquo; she whispers. &lsquo;The minute I hit camp,&rsquo; says I. &ldquo;Twas marked on the bag of potatoes
and onions.&rsquo; &lsquo;They&rsquo;re always together,&rsquo; says she, soft like&ndash;&lsquo;always together in life.&rsquo; &lsquo;They go
well together,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;in a stew.&rsquo; &lsquo;I mean hearts and crosses,&rsquo; says Santa. &lsquo;Our sign&ndash;to love
and to suffer&ndash;that&rsquo;s what they mean.&rsquo;
&ldquo;And there was old Doc Musgrove amusin&rsquo; himself with whisky and a palm-leaf fan.
And by and by Santa goes to sleep; and Doc feels her forehead; and he says to me: &lsquo;You&rsquo;renot such a bad febrifuge. But you&rsquo;d better slide out now; for the diagnosis don&rsquo;t call for you
in regular doses. The little lady&rsquo;ll be all right when she wakes up.&rsquo;
&ldquo;I seen old McAllister outside. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s asleep,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;And now you can start in with your
colander-work. Take your time; for I left my gun on my saddle-horn.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Old Mac laughs, and he says to me: &lsquo;Pumpin&rsquo; lead into the best ranch- boss in West
Texas don&rsquo;t seem to me good business policy. I don&rsquo;t know where I could get as good a one.
It&rsquo;s the son-in-law idea, Webb, that makes me admire for to use you as a target. You ain&rsquo;t my
idea for a member of the family. But I can use you on the Nopalito if you&rsquo;ll keep outside of a
radius with the ranch-house in the middle of it. You go upstairs and lay down on a cot, and
when you get some sleep we&rsquo;ll talk it over.&lsquo;&rdquo;
Baldy Woods pulled down his hat, and uncurled his leg from his saddle- horn. Webb
shortened his rein, and his pony danced, anxious to be off. The two men shook hands with
Western ceremony.
&ldquo;Adios, Baldy,&rdquo; said Webb, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I seen you and had this talk.&rdquo;
With a pounding rush that sounded like the rise of a covey of quail, the riders sped
away toward different points of the compass. A hundred yards on his route Baldy reined in
on the top of a bare knoll, and emitted a yell. He swayed on his horse; had he been on foot,
the earth would have risen and conquered him; but in the saddle he was a master of
equilibrium, and laughed at whisky, and despised the centre of gravity.
Webb turned in his saddle at the signal.
&ldquo;If I was you,&rdquo; came Baldy&rsquo;s strident and perverting tones, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be king!&rdquo;
At eight o&rsquo;clock on the following morning Bud Turner rolled from his saddle in front of
the Nopalito ranch-house, and stumbled with whizzing rowels toward the gallery. Bud was in
charge of the bunch of beef-cattle that was to strike the trail that morning for San Antonio.
Mrs. Yeager was on the gallery watering a cluster of hyacinths growing in a red earthenware
jar.
&ldquo;King&rdquo; McAllister had bequeathed to his daughter many of his strong
characteristics&ndash;his resolution, his gay courage, his contumacious self-reliance, his pride as a
reigning monarch of hoofs and horns. Allegro and fortissimo had been McAllister&rsquo;s temp and
tone. In Santa they survived, transposed to the feminine key. Substantially, she preserved
the image of the mother who had been summoned to wander in other and less finite green
pastures long before the waxing herds of kine had conferred royalty upon the house. She
had her mother&rsquo;s slim, strong figure and grave, soft prettiness that relieved in her the
severity of the imperious McAllister eye and the McAllister air of royal independence.Webb stood on one end of the gallery giving orders to two or three sub-bosses of
various camps and outfits who had ridden in for instructions.
&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; said Bud briefly. &ldquo;Where do you want them beeves to go in town&ndash;to
Barber&rsquo;s, as usual?&rdquo;
Now, to answer that had been the prerogative of the queen. All the reins of
business&ndash;buying, selling, and banking&ndash;had been held by her capable fingers. The handling
of cattle had been entrusted fully to her husband. In the days of &ldquo;King&rdquo; McAllister, Santa had
been his secretary and helper; and she had continued her work with wisdom and profit. But
before she could reply, the prince-consort spake up with calm decision:
&ldquo;You drive that bunch to Zimmerman and Nesbit&rsquo;s pens. I spoke to Zimmerman about it
some time ago.&rdquo;
Bud turned on his high boot-heels.
&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; called Santa quickly. She looked at her husband with surprise in her steady gray
eyes.
&ldquo;Why, what do you mean, Webb?&rdquo; she asked, with a small wrinkle gathering between
her brows. &ldquo;I never deal with Zimmerman and Nesbit. Barber has handled every head of
stock from this ranch in that market for five years. I&rsquo;m not going to take the business out of
his hands.&rdquo; She faced Bud Turner. &ldquo;Deliver those cattle to Barber,&rdquo; she concluded positively.
Bud gazed impartially at the water-jar hanging on the gallery, stood on his other leg,
and chewed a mesquite-leaf.
&ldquo;I want this bunch of beeves to go to Zimmerman and Nesbit,&rdquo; said Webb, with a frosty
light in his blue eyes.
&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Santa impatiently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better start on, Bud, so as to noon at the
Little Elm water-hole. Tell Barber we&rsquo;ll have another lot of culls ready in about a month.&rdquo;
Bud allowed a hesitating eye to steal upward and meet Webb&rsquo;s. Webb saw apology in
his look, and fancied he saw commiseration.
&ldquo;You deliver them cattle,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;to&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Barber,&rdquo; finished Santa sharply. &ldquo;Let that settle it. Is there anything else you are
waiting for, Bud?&ldquo;&ldquo;No, m&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Bud. But before going he lingered while a cow&rsquo;s tail could have
switched thrice; for man is man&rsquo;s ally; and even the Philistines must have blushed when they
took Samson in the way they did.
&ldquo;You hear your boss!&rdquo; cried Webb sardonically. He took off his hat, and bowed until it
touched the floor before his wife.
&ldquo;Webb,&rdquo; said Santa rebukingly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re acting mighty foolish to-day.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Court fool, your Majesty,&rdquo; said Webb, in his slow tones, which had changed their
quality. &ldquo;What else can you expect? Let me tell you. I was a man before I married a
cattle-queen. What am I now? The laughing-stock of the camps. I&rsquo;ll be a man again.&rdquo;
Santa looked at him closely.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be unreasonable, Webb,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been slighted in any way.
Do I ever interfere in your management of the cattle? I know the business side of the ranch
much better than you do. I learned it from Dad. Be sensible.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Kingdoms and queendoms,&rdquo; said Webb, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t suit me unless I am in the pictures, too.
I punch the cattle and you wear the crown. All right. I&rsquo;d rather be High Lord Chancellor of a
cow-camp than the eight-spot in a queen-high flush. It&rsquo;s your ranch; and Barber gets the
beeves.&rdquo;
Webb&rsquo;s horse was tied to the rack. He walked into the house and brought out his roll of
blankets that he never took with him except on long rides, and his &ldquo;slicker,&rdquo; and his longest
stake-rope of plaited raw-hide. These he began to tie deliberately upon his saddle. Santa, a
little pale, followed him.
Webb swung up into the saddle. His serious, smooth face was without expression
except for a stubborn light that smouldered in his eyes.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a herd of cows and calves,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;near the Hondo water- hole on the Frio
that ought to be moved away from timber. Lobos have killed three of the calves. I forgot to
leave orders. You&rsquo;d better tell Simms to attend to it.&rdquo;
Santa laid a hand on the horse&rsquo;s bridle, and looked her husband in the eye.
&ldquo;Are you going to leave me, Webb?&rdquo; she asked quietly.
&ldquo;I am going to be a man again,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I wish you success in a praiseworthy attempt,&rdquo; she said, with a sudden coldness. She
turned and walked directly into the house.Webb Yeager rode to the southeast as straight as the topography of West Texas
permitted. And when he reached the horizon he might have ridden on into blue space as far
as knowledge of him on the Nopalito went. And the days, with Sundays at their head,
formed into hebdomadal squads; and the weeks, captained by the full moon, closed ranks
into menstrual companies crying &ldquo;Tempus fugit&rdquo; on their banners; and the months marched
on toward the vast camp-ground of the years; but Webb Yeager came no more to the
dominions of his queen.
One day a being named Bartholomew, a sheep-man&ndash;and therefore of little
account&ndash;from the lower Rio Grande country, rode in sight of the Nopalito ranch-house, and
felt hunger assail him. Ex consuetudine he was soon seated at the mid-day dining table of
that hospitable kingdom. Talk like water gushed from him: he might have been smitten with
Aaron&rsquo;s rod&ndash;that is your gentle shepherd when an audience is vouchsafed him whose ears
are not overgrown with wool.
&ldquo;Missis Yeager,&rdquo; he babbled, &ldquo;I see a man the other day on the Rancho Seco down in
Hidalgo County by your name&ndash;Webb Yeager was his. He&rsquo;d just been engaged as manager. He
was a tall, light-haired man, not saying much. Perhaps he was some kin of yours, do you
think?&rdquo;
&ldquo;A husband,&rdquo; said Santa cordially. &ldquo;The Seco has done well. Mr. Yeager is one of the best
stockmen in the West.&rdquo;
The dropping out of a prince-consort rarely disorganises a monarchy. Queen Santa had
appointed as mayordomo of the ranch a trusty subject, named Ramsay, who had been one
of her father&rsquo;s faithful vassals. And there was scarcely a ripple on the Nopalito ranch save
when the gulf-breeze created undulations in the grass of its wide acres.
For several years the Nopalito had been making experiments with an English breed of
cattle that looked down with aristocratic contempt upon the Texas long-horns. The
experiments were found satisfactory; and a pasture had been set aside for the blue-bloods.
The fame of them had gone forth into the chaparral and pear as far as men ride in saddles.
Other ranches woke up, rubbed their eyes, and looked with new dissatisfaction upon the
long-horns.
As a consequence, one day a sunburned, capable, silk-kerchiefed nonchalant youth,
garnished with revolvers, and attended by three Mexican vaqueros, alighted at the Nopalito
ranch and presented the following business-like epistle to the queen thereof:
Mrs. Yeager&ndash;The Nopalito Ranch:
Dear Madam:I am instructed by the owners of the Rancho Seco to purchase 100 head of two and
three-year-old cows of the Sussex breed owned by you. If you can fill the order please
deliver the cattle to the bearer; and a check will be forwarded to you at once.
Respectfully,
Webster Yeager,
Manager the Rancho Seco.
Business is business, even&ndash;very scantily did it escape being written &ldquo;especially&rdquo;&ndash;in a
kingdom.
That night the 100 head of cattle were driven up from the pasture and penned in a
corral near the ranch-house for delivery in the morning.
When night closed down and the house was still, did Santa Yeager throw herself down,
clasping that formal note to her bosom, weeping, and calling out a name that pride (either
in one or the other) had kept from her lips many a day? Or did she file the letter, in her
business way, retaining her royal balance and strength?
Wonder, if you will; but royalty is sacred; and there is a veil. But this much you shall
learn:
At midnight Santa slipped softly out of the ranch-house, clothed in something dark and
plain. She paused for a moment under the live-oak trees. The prairies were somewhat dim,
and the moonlight was pale orange, diluted with particles of an impalpable, flying mist. But
the mock-bird whistled on every bough of vantage; leagues of flowers scented the air; and a
kindergarten of little shadowy rabbits leaped and played in an open space near by. Santa
turned her face to the southeast and threw three kisses thitherward; for there was none to
see.
Then she sped silently to the blacksmith-shop, fifty yards away; and what she did there
can only be surmised. But the forge glowed red; and there was a faint hammering such as
Cupid might make when he sharpens his arrow-points.
Later she came forth with a queer-shaped, handled thing in one hand, and a portable
furnace, such as are seen in branding-camps, in the other. To the corral where the Sussex
cattle were penned she sped with these things swiftly in the moonlight.
She opened the gate and slipped inside the corral. The Sussex cattle were mostly a dark
red. But among this bunch was one that was milky white&ndash;notable among the others.
And now Santa shook from her shoulder something that we had not seen before&ndash;a
rope lasso. She freed the loop of it, coiling the length in her left hand, and plunged into the
thick of the cattle.The white cow was her object. She swung the lasso, which caught one horn and slipped
off. The next throw encircled the forefeet and the animal fell heavily. Santa made for it like a
panther; but it scrambled up and dashed against her, knocking her over like a blade of grass.
Again she made her cast, while the aroused cattle milled around the four sides of the
corral in a plunging mass. This throw was fair; the white cow came to earth again; and
before it could rise Santa had made the lasso fast around a post of the corral with a swift
and simple knot, and had leaped upon the cow again with the rawhide hobbles.
In one minute the feet of the animal were tied (no record-breaking deed) and Santa
leaned against the corral for the same space of time, panting and lax.
And then she ran swiftly to her furnace at the gate and brought the branding-iron,
queerly shaped and white-hot.
The bellow of the outraged white cow, as the iron was applied, should have stirred the
slumbering auricular nerves and consciences of the near-by subjects of the Nopalito, but it
did not. And it was amid the deepest nocturnal silence that Santa ran like a lapwing back to
the ranch-house and there fell upon a cot and sobbed&ndash;sobbed as though queens had hearts
as simple ranchmen&rsquo;s wives have, and as though she would gladly make kings of
prince-consorts, should they ride back again from over the hills and far away.
In the morning the capable, revolvered youth and his vaqueros set forth, driving the
bunch of Sussex cattle across the prairies to the Rancho Seco. Ninety miles it was; a six days&rsquo;
journey, grazing and watering the animals on the way.
The beasts arrived at Rancho Seco one evening at dusk; and were received and counted
by the foreman of the ranch.
The next morning at eight o&rsquo;clock a horseman loped out of the brush to the Nopalito
ranch-house. He dismounted stiffly, and strode, with whizzing spurs, to the house. His horse
gave a great sigh and swayed foam-streaked, with down-drooping head and closed eyes.
But waste not your pity upon Belshazzar, the flea-bitten sorrel. To-day, in Nopalito
horse-pasture he survives, pampered, beloved, unridden, cherished record-holder of
long-distance rides.
The horseman stumbled into the house. Two arms fell around his neck, and someone
cried out in the voice of woman and queen alike: &ldquo;Webb&ndash; oh, Webb!&rdquo;
&ldquo;I was a skunk,&rdquo; said Webb Yeager.
&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said Santa, &ldquo;did you see it?&rdquo;&ldquo;I saw it,&rdquo; said Webb.
What they meant God knows; and you shall know, if you rightly read the primer of
events.
&ldquo;Be the cattle-queen,&rdquo; said Webb; &ldquo;and overlook it if you can. I was a mangy,
sheep-stealing coyote.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Santa again, laying her fingers upon his mouth. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no queen here.
Do you know who I am? I am Santa Yeager, First Lady of the Bedchamber. Come here.&rdquo;
She dragged him from the gallery into the room to the right. There stood a cradle with
an infant in it&ndash;a red, ribald, unintelligible, babbling, beautiful infant, sputtering at life in an
unseemly manner.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no queen on this ranch,&rdquo; said Santa again. &ldquo;Look at the king. He&rsquo;s got your eyes,
Webb. Down on your knees and look at his Highness.&rdquo;
But jingling rowels sounded on the gallery, and Bud Turner stumbled there again with
the same query that he had brought, lacking a few days, a year ago.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Morning. Them beeves is just turned out on the trail. Shall I drive &lsquo;em to Barber&rsquo;s,
or&ndash;&rdquo;
He saw Webb and stopped, open-mouthed.
&ldquo;Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!&rdquo; shrieked the king in his cradle, beating the air with his fists.
&ldquo;You hear your boss, Bud,&rdquo; said Webb Yeager, with a broad grin&ndash;just as he had said a
year ago.
And that is all, except that when old man Quinn, owner of the Rancho Seco, went out
to look over the herd of Sussex cattle that he had bought from the Nopalito ranch, he asked
his new manager:
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Nopalito ranch brand, Wilson?&rdquo;
&ldquo;X Bar Y,&rdquo; said Wilson.
&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said Quinn. &ldquo;But look at that white heifer there; she&rsquo;s got another
brand&ndash;a heart with a cross inside of it. What brand is that?&ldquo;Hearts and Hands （O·Henry）</p>

<p>At Denver there was an influx of passengers into the coaches on the eastbound B. &amp; M.
express. In one coach there sat a very pretty young woman dressed in elegant taste and
surrounded by all the luxurious comforts of an experienced traveler. Among the newcomers
were two young men, one of handsome presence with a bold, frank countenance and
manner; the other a ruffled, glum-faced person, heavily built and roughly dressed. The two
were handcuffed together.
As they passed down the aisle of the coach the only vacant seat offered was a reversed
one facing the attractive young woman. Here the linked couple seated themselves. The
young woman&rsquo;s glance fell upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely
smile brightening her countenance and a tender pink tingeing her rounded cheeks, she held
out a little gray-gloved hand. When she spoke her voice, full, sweet, and deliberate,
proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard.
&ldquo;Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must. Don&rsquo;t vou ever
recognize old friends when you meet them in the West?&rdquo;
The younger man roused himself sharply at the sound of her voice, seemed to struggle
with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly, and then clasped her fingers with
his left hand.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Miss Fairchild,&rdquo; he said, with a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you to excuse the other hand; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
otherwise engaged just at present.&rdquo;
He slightly raised his right hand, bound at the wrist by the shining &ldquo;bracelet&rdquo; to the left
one of his companion. The glad look in the girl&rsquo;s eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror.
The glow faded from her cheeks. Her lips parted in a vague, relaxing distress. Easton, with a
little laugh, as if amused, was about to speak again when the other forestalled him. The
glum-faced man had been watching the girl&rsquo;s countenance with veiled glances from his keen,
shrewd eyes.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me for speaking, miss, but, I see you&rsquo;re acquainted with the marshall
here. If you&rsquo;ll ask him to speak a word for me when we get to the pen he&rsquo;ll do it, and it&rsquo;ll
make things easier for me there. He&rsquo;s taking me to Leavenworth prison. It&rsquo;s seven years for
counterfeiting.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the girl, with a deep breath and returning color. &ldquo;So that is what you are
doing out here? A marshal!&ldquo;&ldquo;My dear Miss Fairchild,&rdquo; said Easton, calmly, &ldquo;I had to do something. Money has a way
of taking wings unto itself, and you know it takes money to keep step with our crowd in
Washington. I saw this opening in the West, and&ndash;well, a marshalship isn&rsquo;t quite as high a
position as that of ambassador, but&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;The ambassador,&rdquo; said the girl, warmly, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t call any more. He needn&rsquo;t ever have
done so. You ought to know that. And so now you are one of these dashing Western heroes,
and you ride and shoot and go into all kinds of dangers. That&rsquo;s different from the
Washington life. You have been missed from the old crowd.&rdquo;
The girl&rsquo;s eyes, fascinated, went back, widening a little, to rest upon the glittering
handcuffs.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about them, miss,&rdquo; said the other man. &ldquo;All marshals handcuff
themselves to their prisoners to keep them from getting away. Mr. Easton knows his
business.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Will we see you again soon in Washington?&rdquo; asked the girl.
&ldquo;Not soon, I think,&rdquo; said Easton. &ldquo;My butterfly days are over, I fear.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I love the West,&rdquo; said the girl irrelevantly. Her eyes were shining softly. She looked
away out the car window. She began to speak truly and simply without the gloss of style and
manner: &ldquo;Mamma and I spent the summer in Denver. She went home a week ago because
father was slightly ill. I could live and be happy in the West. I think the air here agrees with
me. Money isn&rsquo;t everything. But people always misunderstand things and remain stupid&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Say, Mr. Marshal,&rdquo; growled the glum-faced man. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t quite fair. I&rsquo;m needing a
drink, and haven&rsquo;t had a smoke all day. Haven&rsquo;t you talked long enough? Take me in the
smoker now, won&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m half dead for a pipe.&rdquo;
The bound travelers rose to their feet, Easton with the same slow smile on his face.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t deny a petition for tobacco,&rdquo; he said, lightly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the one friend of the
unfortunate. Good-bye, Miss Fairchild. Duty calls, you know.&rdquo; He held out his hand for a
farewell.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad you are not going East,&rdquo; she said, reclothing herself with manner and style.
&ldquo;But you must go on to Leavenworth, I suppose?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Easton, &ldquo;I must go on to Leavenworth.&rdquo;
The two men sidled down the aisle into the smoker.The two passengers in a seat near by had heard most of the conversation. Said one of
them: &ldquo;That marshal&rsquo;s a good sort of chap. Some of these Western fellows are all right.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pretty young to hold an office like that, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; asked the other.
&ldquo;Young!&rdquo; exclaimed the first speaker, &ldquo;why&ndash;Oh! didn&rsquo;t you catch on? Say&ndash;did you ever
know an officer to handcuff a prisoner to his right hand?&rdquo;
The Hiding of Black Bill （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>A lank, strong, red-faced man with a Wellington beak and small, fiery eyes tempered by
flaxen lashes, sat on the station platform at Los Pinos swinging his legs to and fro. At his side
sat another man, fat, melancholy, and seedy, who seemed to be his friend. They had the
appearance of men to whom life had appeared as a reversible coat&ndash; seamy on both sides.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t seen you in about four years, Ham,&rdquo; said the seedy man. &ldquo;Which way you been
travelling?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Texas,&rdquo; said the red-faced man. &ldquo;It was too cold in Alaska for me. And I found it warm
in Texas. I&rsquo;ll tell you about one hot spell I went through there.
&ldquo;One morning I steps off the International at a water-tank and lets it go on without me.
&lsquo;Twas a ranch country, and fuller of spite-houses than New York City. Only out there they
build &lsquo;em twenty miles away so you can&rsquo;t smell what they&rsquo;ve got for dinner, instead of
running &lsquo;em up two inches from their neighbors&rsquo; windows.
&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any roads in sight, so I footed it &lsquo;cross country. The grass was shoe-top
deep, and the mesquite timber looked just like a peach orchard. It was so much like a
gentleman&rsquo;s private estate that every minute you expected a kennelful of bulldogs to run out
and bite you. But I must have walked twenty miles before I came in sight of a ranch-house. It
was a little one, about as big as an elevated- railroad station.
&ldquo;There was a little man in a white shirt and brown overalls and a pink handkerchief
around his neck rolling cigarettes under a tree in front of the door.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Greetings,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Any refreshment, welcome, emoluments, or even work for a
comparative stranger?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, come in,&rsquo; says he, in a refined tone. &lsquo;Sit down on that stool, please. I didn&rsquo;t hear
your horse coming.&lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;He isn&rsquo;t near enough yet,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I walked. I don&rsquo;t want to be a burden, but I wonder if
you have three or four gallons of water handy.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;You do look pretty dusty,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;but our bathing arrangements&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a drink I want,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Never mind the dust that&rsquo;s on the outside.&rsquo;
&ldquo;He gets me a dipper of water out of a red jar hanging up, and then goes on:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you want work?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;For a time,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;This is a rather quiet section of the country, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;It is,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Sometimes&ndash;so I have been told&ndash;one sees no human being pass for
weeks at a time. I&rsquo;ve been here only a month. I bought the ranch from an old settler who
wanted to move farther west.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;It suits me,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Quiet and retirement are good for a man sometimes. And I need a
job. I can tend bar, salt mines, lecture, float stock, do a little middle-weight slugging, and
play the piano.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Can you herd sheep ?&rsquo; asks the little ranch-man.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you mean have I heard sheep?&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Can you herd &lsquo;em&ndash;take charge of a flock of &lsquo;em ?&rsquo; says he.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;now I understand. You mean chase &lsquo;em around and bark at &lsquo;em like collie
dogs. Well, I might,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never exactly done any sheep-herding, but I&rsquo;ve often seen
&lsquo;em from car windows masticating daisies, and they don&rsquo;t look dangerous.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m short a herder,&rsquo; says the ranchman. &lsquo;You never can depend on the Mexicans. I&rsquo;ve
only got two flocks. You may take out my bunch of muttons&ndash;there are only eight hundred of
&lsquo;em&ndash;in the morning, if you like. The pay is twelve dollars a month and your rations furnished.
You camp in a tent on the prairie with your sheep. You do your own cooking, but wood and
water are brought to your camp. It&rsquo;s an easy job.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m on,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take the job even if I have to garland my brow and hold on to a
crook and wear a loose-effect and play on a pipe like the shepherds do in pictures.&rsquo;
&ldquo;So the next morning the little ranchman helps me drive the flock of muttons from the
corral to about two miles out and let &lsquo;em graze on a little hillside on the prairie. He gives mea lot of instructions about not letting bunches of them stray off from the herd, and driving
&lsquo;em down to a water-hole to drink at noon.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bring out your tent and camping outfit and rations in the buckboard before night,&rsquo;
says he.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Fine,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;And don&rsquo;t forget the rations. Nor the camping outfit. And be sure to
bring the tent. Your name&rsquo;s Zollicoffer, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;My name,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;is Henry Ogden.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;All right, Mr. Ogden,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Mine is Mr. Percival Saint Clair.&rsquo;
&ldquo;I herded sheep for five days on the Rancho Chiquito; and then the wool entered my
soul. That getting next to Nature certainly got next to me. I was lonesomer than Crusoe&rsquo;s
goat. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of persons more entertaining as companions than those sheep were. I&rsquo;d
drive &lsquo;em to the corral and pen &lsquo;em every evening, and then cook my corn-bread and
mutton and coffee, and lie down in a tent the size of a table-cloth, and listen to the coyotes
and whippoorwills singing around the camp.
&ldquo;The fifth evening, after I had corralled my costly but uncongenial muttons, I walked
over to the ranch-house and stepped in the door.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Ogden,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;you and me have got to get sociable. Sheep are all very well to dot
the landscape and furnish eight-dollar cotton suitings for man, but for table-talk and fireside
companions they rank along with five-o&rsquo;clock teazers. If you&rsquo;ve got a deck of cards, or a
parcheesi outfit, or a game of authors, get &lsquo;em out, and let&rsquo;s get on a mental basis. I&rsquo;ve got
to do something in an intellectual line, if it&rsquo;s only to knock somebody&rsquo;s brains out.&rsquo;
&ldquo;This Henry Ogden was a peculiar kind of ranchman. He wore finger- rings and a big
gold watch and careful neckties. And his face was calm, and his nose-spectacles was kept
very shiny. I saw once, in Muscogee, an outlaw hung for murdering six men, who was a dead
ringer for him. But I knew a preacher in Arkansas that you would have taken to be his
brother. I didn&rsquo;t care much for him either way; what I wanted was some fellowship and
communion with holy saints or lost sinners&ndash;anything sheepless would do.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Saint Clair,&rsquo; says he, laying down the book he was reading, &lsquo;I guess it must be
pretty lonesome for you at first. And I don&rsquo;t deny that it&rsquo;s monotonous for me. Are you sure
you corralled your sheep so they won&rsquo;t stray out ?
&ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;re shut up as tight as the jury of a millionaire murderer,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll be back
with them long before they&rsquo;ll need their trained nurse.&lsquo;&ldquo;So Ogden digs up a deck of cards, and we play casino. After five days and nights of my
sheep-camp it was like a toot on Broadway. When I caught big casino I felt as excited as if I
had made a million in Trinity. And when H. O. loosened up a little and told the story about
the lady in the Pullman car I laughed for five minutes.
&ldquo;That showed what a comparative thing life is. A man may see so much that he&rsquo;d be
bored to turn his head to look at a $3,000,000 fire or Joe Weber or the Adriatic Sea. But let
him herd sheep for a spell, and you&rsquo;ll see him splitting his ribs laughing at &lsquo;Curfew Shall Not
Ring To-night,&rsquo; or really enjoying himself playing cards with ladies.
&ldquo;By-and-by Ogden gets out a decanter of Bourbon, and then there is a total eclipse of
sheep.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you remember reading in the papers, about a month ago,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;about a train
hold-up on the M. K. &amp; T.? The express agent was shot through the shoulder, and about
$15,000 in currency taken. And it&rsquo;s said that only one man did the job.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Seems to me I do,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;But such things happen so often they don&rsquo;t linger long in
the human Texas mind. Did they overtake, overhaul, seize, or lay hands upon the despoiler?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;He escaped,&rsquo; says Ogden. &lsquo;And I was just reading in a paper to-day that the officers
have tracked him down into this part of the country. It seems the bills the robber got were
all the first issue of currency to the Second National Bank of Espinosa City. And so they&rsquo;ve
followed the trail where they&rsquo;ve been spent, and it leads this way.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Ogden pours out some more Bourbon, and shoves me the bottle.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I imagine,&rsquo; says I, after ingurgitating another modicum of the royal boose, &lsquo;that it
wouldn&rsquo;t be at all a disingenuous idea for a train robber to run down into this part of the
country to hide for a spell. A sheep-ranch, now,&rsquo; says I, would be the finest kind of a place.
Who&rsquo;d ever expect to find such a desperate character among these song- birds and muttons
and wild flowers? And, by the way,&rsquo; says I, kind of looking H. Ogden over, &lsquo;was there any
description mentioned of this single-handed terror? Was his lineaments or height and
thickness or teeth fillings or style of habiliments set forth in print ?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, no,&rsquo; says Ogden; &lsquo;they say nobody got a good sight of him because he wore a
mask. But they know it was a train-robber called Black Bill, because he always works alone
and because he dropped a handkerchief in the express-car that had his name on it.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I approve of Black Bill&rsquo;s retreat to the sheep-ranges. I guess they
won&rsquo;t find him.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s one thousand dollars reward for his capture,&rsquo; says Ogden.&rdquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t need that kind of money,&rsquo; says I, looking Mr. Sheepman straight in the eye. &lsquo;The
twelve dollars a month you pay me is enough. I need a rest, and I can save up until I get
enough to pay my fare to Texarkana, where my widowed mother lives. If Black Bill,&rsquo; I goes on,
looking significantly at Ogden, was to have come down this way&ndash;say, a month ago&ndash;and
bought a little sheep-ranch and&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; says Ogden, getting out of his chair and looking pretty vicious. &lsquo;Do you mean to
insinuate&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;no insinuations. I&rsquo;m stating a hypodermical case. I say, if Black Bill
had come down here and bought a sheep- ranch and hired me to Little-Boy-Blue &lsquo;em and
treated me square and friendly, as you&rsquo;ve done, he&rsquo;d never have anything to fear from me. A
man is a man, regardless of any complications he may have with sheep or railroad trains.
Now you know where I stand.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Ogden looks black as camp-coffee for nine seconds, and then he laughs, amused.
&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll do, Saint Clair,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;If I was Black Bill I wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to trust you. Let&rsquo;s
have a game or two of seven-up to- night. That is, if you don&rsquo;t mind playing with a
train-robber.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve told you,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;my oral sentiments, and there&rsquo;s no strings to &lsquo;em.&rsquo;
&ldquo;While I was shuffling after the first hand, I asks Ogden, as if the idea was a kind of a
casualty, where he was from.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;from the Mississippi Valley.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a nice little place,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve often stopped over there. But didn&rsquo;t you find the
sheets a little damp and the food poor? Now, I hail,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;from the Pacific Slope. Ever put
up there?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Too draughty,&rsquo; says Ogden. &lsquo;But if you&rsquo;ve ever in the Middle West just mention my
name, and you&rsquo;ll get foot-warmers and dripped coffee.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t exactly fishing for your private telephone number and the
middle name of your aunt that carried off the Cumberland Presbyterian minister. It don&rsquo;t
matter. I just want you to know you are safe in the hands of your shepherd. Now, don&rsquo;t play
hearts on spades, and don&rsquo;t get nervous.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Still harping,&rsquo; says Ogden, laughing again. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose that if I was Black Bill
and thought you suspected me, I&rsquo;d put a Winchester bullet into you and stop my
nervousness, if I had any?&lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;Not any,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;A man who&rsquo;s got the nerve to hold up a train single-handed wouldn&rsquo;t
do a trick like that. I&rsquo;ve knocked about enough to know that them are the kind of men who
put a value on a friend. Not that I can claim being a friend of yours, Mr. Ogden,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;being
only your sheep-herder; but under more expeditious circumstances we might have been.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Forget the sheep temporarily, I beg,&rsquo; says Ogden, &lsquo;and cut for deal.&rsquo;
&ldquo;About four days afterward, while my muttons was nooning on the water- hole and I
deep in the interstices of making a pot of coffee, up rides softly on the grass a mysterious
person in the garb of the being he wished to represent. He was dressed somewhere
between a Kansas City detective, Buffalo Bill, and the town dog-catcher of Baton Rouge. His
chin and eye wasn&rsquo;t molded on fighting lines, so I knew he was only a scout.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Herdin&rsquo; sheep?&rsquo; he asks me.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;to a man of your evident gumptional endowments, I wouldn&rsquo;t have the
nerve to state that I am engaged in decorating old bronzes or oiling bicycle sprockets.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t talk or look like a sheep-herder to me,&rsquo; says he.
&ldquo;&lsquo;But you talk like what you look like to me,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;And then he asks me who I was working for, and I shows him Rancho Chiquito, two
miles away, in the shadow of a low hill, and he tells me he&rsquo;s a deputy sheriff.
&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a train-robber called Black Bill supposed to be somewhere in these parts,&rsquo; says
the scout. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s been traced as far as San Antonio, and maybe farther. Have you seen or
heard of any strangers around here during the past month?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I have not,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;except a report of one over at the Mexican quarters of Loomis&rsquo;
ranch, on the Frio.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you know about him?&rsquo; asks the deputy.
&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s three days old,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;&lsquo;What kind of a looking man is the man you work for ?&rsquo; he asks. &lsquo;Does old George
Ramey own this place yet? He&rsquo;s run sheep here for the last ten years, but never had no
success.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;The old man has sold out and gone West,&rsquo; I tells him. &lsquo;Another sheep-fancier bought
him out about a month ago.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;What kind of a looking man is he ?&rsquo; asks the deputy again.&rdquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo; a big, fat kind of a Dutchman with long whiskers and blue specs. I don&rsquo;t
think he knows a sheep from a ground-squirrel. I guess old George soaked him pretty well on
the deal,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;After indulging himself in a lot more non-communicative information and two-thirds
of my dinner, the deputy rides away.
&ldquo;That night I mentions the matter to Ogden. &ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;re drawing the tendrils of the
octopus around Black Bill,&rsquo; says I. And then I told him about the deputy sheriff, and how I&rsquo;d
described him to the deputy, and what the deputy said about the matter.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, well,&rsquo; says Ogden, &lsquo;let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t borrow any of Black Bill&rsquo;s troubles. We&rsquo;ve a few of
our own. Get the Bourbon out of the cupboard and we&rsquo;ll drink to his health&ndash;unless,&rsquo; says he,
with his little cackling laugh, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re prejudiced against train-robbers.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll drink,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;to any man who&rsquo;s a friend to a friend. And I believe that Black Bill,&rsquo; I
goes on, &lsquo;would be that. So here&rsquo;s to Black Bill, and may he have good luck.&rsquo;
&ldquo;And both of us drank.
&ldquo;About two weeks later comes shearing-time. The sheep had to be driven up to the
ranch, and a lot of frowzy-headed Mexicans would snip the fur off of them with back-action
scissors. So the afternoon before the barbers were to come I hustled my underdone muttons
over the hill, across the dell, down by the winding brook, and up to the ranch-house, where I
penned &lsquo;em in a corral and bade &lsquo;em my nightly adieus.
&ldquo;I went from there to the ranch-house. I find H. Ogden, Esquire, lying asleep on his little
cot bed. I guess he had been overcome by anti-insomnia or diswakefulness or some of the
diseases peculiar to the sheep business. His mouth and vest were open, and he breathed like
a second-hand bicycle pump. I looked at him and gave vent to just a few musings. &lsquo;Imperial
Caesar,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;asleep in such a way, might shut his mouth and keep the wind away.&rsquo;
A man asleep is certainly a sight to make angels weep. What good is all his brain,
muscle, backing, nerve, influence, and family connections? He&rsquo;s at the mercy of his enemies,
and more so of his friends. And he&rsquo;s about as beautiful as a cab-horse leaning against the
Metropolitan Opera House at 12.30 A.M. dreaming of the plains of Arabia. Now, a woman
asleep you regard as different. No matter how she looks, you know it&rsquo;s better for all hands
for her to be that way.
&ldquo;Well, I took a drink of Bourbon and one for Ogden, and started in to be comfortable
while he was taking his nap. He had some books on his table on indigenous subjects, such as
Japan and drainage and physical culture&ndash;and some tobacco, which seemed more to the
point.&ldquo;After I&rsquo;d smoked a few, and listened to the sartorial breathing of H. O., I happened to
look out the window toward the shearing-pens, where there was a kind of a road coming up
from a kind of a road across a kind of a creek farther away.
&ldquo;I saw five men riding up to the house. All of &lsquo;em carried guns across their saddles, and
among &lsquo;em was the deputy that had talked to me at my camp.
&ldquo;They rode up careful, in open formation, with their guns ready. I set apart with my eye
the one I opinionated to be the boss muck-raker of this law-and-order cavalry.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-evening, gents,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you &lsquo;light, and tie your horses?&rsquo;
&ldquo;The boss rides up close, and swings his gun over till the opening in it seems to cover
my whole front elevation.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you move your hands none,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;till you and me indulge in a adequate
amount of necessary conversation.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I will not,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I am no deaf-mute, and therefore will not have to disobey your
injunctions in replying.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;We are on the lookout,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;for Black Bill, the man that held up the Katy for
$15,000 in May. We are searching the ranches and everybody on &lsquo;em. What is your name,
and what do you do on this ranch?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Captain,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;Percival Saint Clair is my occupation, and my name is sheep-herder.
I&rsquo;ve got my flock of veals&ndash;no, muttons&ndash;penned here to-night. The shearers are coming
to-morrow to give them a hair- cut&ndash;with baa-a-rum, I suppose.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the boss of this ranch?&rsquo; the captain of the gang asks me.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Wait just a minute, cap&rsquo;n,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t there a kind of a reward offered for the
capture of this desperate character you have referred to in your preamble?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a thousand dollars reward offered,&rsquo; says the captain, &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s for his capture
and conviction. There don&rsquo;t seem to be no provision made for an informer.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;It looks like it might rain in a day or so,&rsquo; says I, in a tired way, looking up at the
cerulean blue sky.
&ldquo;&lsquo;If you know anything about the locality, disposition, or secretiveness of this here Black
Bill,&rsquo; says he, in a severe dialect, &lsquo;you are amiable to the law in not reporting it.&rsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;I heard a fence-rider say,&rsquo; says I, in a desultory kind of voice, &lsquo;that a Mexican told a
cowboy named Jake over at Pidgin&rsquo;s store on the Nueces that he heard that Black Bill had
been seen in Matamoras by a sheepman&rsquo;s cousin two weeks ago.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, Tight Mouth,&rsquo; says the captain, after looking me over for bargains.
&lsquo;If you put us on so we can scoop Black Bill, I&rsquo;ll pay you a hundred dollars out of my own&ndash;out
of our own&ndash;pockets. That&rsquo;s liberal,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;You ain&rsquo;t entitled to anything. Now, what do
you say?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Cash down now?&rsquo; I asks.
&ldquo;The captain has a sort of discussion with his helpmates, and they all produce the
contents of their pockets for analysis. Out of the general results they figured up $102.30 in
cash and $31 worth of plug tobacco.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Come nearer, capitan meeo,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and listen.&rsquo; He so did.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I am mighty poor and low down in the world,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I am working for twelve dollars a
month trying to keep a lot of animals together whose only thought seems to be to get
asunder. Although,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I regard myself as some better than the State of South Dakota, it&rsquo;s
a come-down to a man who has heretofore regarded sheep only in the form of chops. I&rsquo;m
pretty far reduced in the world on account of foiled ambitions and rum and a kind of cocktail
they make along the P. R. R. all the way from Scranton to Cincinnati&ndash;dry gin, French
vermouth, one squeeze of a lime, and a good dash of orange bitters. If you&rsquo;re ever up that
way, don&rsquo;t fail to let one try you. And, again,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I have never yet went back on a friend.
I&rsquo;ve stayed by &lsquo;em when they had plenty, and when adversity&rsquo;s overtaken me I&rsquo;ve never
forsook &lsquo;em.
&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; I goes on, &lsquo;this is not exactly the case of a friend. Twelve dollars a month is only
bowing-acquaintance money. And I do not consider brown beans and corn-bread the food of
friendship. I am a poor man,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and I have a widowed mother in Texarkana. You will find
Black Bill,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;lying asleep in this house on a cot in the room to your right. He&rsquo;s the man
you want, as I know from his words and conversation. He was in a way a friend,&rsquo; I explains,
&lsquo;and if I was the man I once was the entire product of the mines of Gondola would not have
tempted me to betray him. But,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;every week half of the beans was wormy, and not
nigh enough wood in camp.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Better go in careful, gentlemen,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;He seems impatient at times, and when you
think of his late professional pursuits one would look for abrupt actions if he was come upon
sudden.&rsquo;
&ldquo;So the whole posse unmounts and ties their horses, and unlimbers their ammunition
and equipments, and tiptoes into the house. And I follows, like Delilah when she set the
Philip Stein on to Samson.&ldquo;The leader of the posse shakes Ogden and wakes him up. And then he jumps up, and
two more of the reward-hunters grab him. Ogden was mighty tough with all his slimness,
and he gives &lsquo;em as neat a single- footed tussle against odds as I ever see.
&ldquo;&lsquo;What does this mean?&rsquo; he says, after they had him down.
&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re scooped in, Mr. Black Bill,&rsquo; says the captain. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s an outrage,&rsquo; says H. Ogden, madder yet.
&ldquo;&lsquo;It was,&rsquo; says the peace-and-good-will man. &lsquo;The Katy wasn&rsquo;t bothering you, and
there&rsquo;s a law against monkeying with express packages.&rsquo;
&ldquo;And he sits on H. Ogden&rsquo;s stomach and goes through his pockets symptomatically and
careful.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make you perspire for this,&rsquo; says Ogden, perspiring some himself. &lsquo;I can prove who I
am.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;So can I,&rsquo; says the captain, as he draws from H. Ogden&rsquo;s inside coat-pocket a handful
of new bills of the Second National Bank of Espinosa City. &lsquo;Your regular engraved
Tuesdays-and-Fridays visiting- card wouldn&rsquo;t have a louder voice in proclaiming your
indemnity than this here currency. You can get up now and prepare to go with us and
expatriate your sins.
&ldquo;H. Ogden gets up and fixes his necktie. He says no more after they have taken the
money off of him.
&ldquo;&lsquo;A well-greased idea,&rsquo; says the sheriff captain, admiring, &lsquo;to slip off down here and buy
a little sheep-ranch where the hand of man is seldom heard. It was the slickest hide-out I
ever see,&rsquo; says the captain.
&ldquo;So one of the men goes to the shearing-pen and hunts up the other herder, a Mexican
they call John Sallies, and he saddles Ogden&rsquo;s horse, and the sheriffs all ride tip close around
him with their guns in hand, ready to take their prisoner to town.
&ldquo;Before starting, Ogden puts the ranch in John Sallies&rsquo; hands and gives him orders
about the shearing and where to graze the sheep, just as if he intended to be back in a few
days. And a couple of hours afterward one Percival Saint Clair, an ex-sheep-herder of the
Rancho Chiquito, might have been seen, with a hundred and nine dollars&ndash;wages and
blood-money&ndash;in his pocket, riding south on another horse belonging to said ranch.&ldquo;The red-faced man paused and listened. The whistle of a coming freight-train sounded
far away among the low hills.
The fat, seedy man at his side sniffed, and shook his frowzy head slowly and
disparagingly.
&ldquo;What is it, Snipy?&rdquo; asked the other. &ldquo;Got the blues again?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t&rdquo; said the seedy one, sniffing again. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like your talk. You and me
have been friends, off and on, for fifteen year; and I never yet knew or heard of you giving
anybody up to the law&ndash;not no one. And here was a man whose saleratus you had et and at
whose table you had played games of cards&ndash;if casino can be so called. And yet you inform
him to the law and take money for it. It never was like you, I say.&rdquo;
&ldquo;This H. Ogden,&rdquo; resumed the red-faced man, &ldquo;through a lawyer, proved himself free by
alibis and other legal terminalities, as I so heard afterward. He never suffered no harm. He
did me favors, and I hated to hand him over.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How about the bills they found in his pocket?&rdquo; asked the seedy man.
&ldquo;I put &lsquo;em there,&rdquo; said the red-faced man, &ldquo;while he was asleep, when I saw the posse
riding up. I was Black Bill. Look out, Snipy, here she comes! We&rsquo;ll board her on the bumpers
when she takes water at the tank.&rdquo;
The Higher Abdication （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Curly the tramp sidled toward the free-lunch counter. He caught a fleeting glance from
the bartender&rsquo;s eye, and stood still, trying to look like a business man who had just dined at
the Menger and was waiting for a friend who had promised to pick him up in his motor car.
Curly&rsquo;s histrionic powers were equal to the impersonation; but his make-up was wanting.
The bartender rounded the bar in a casual way, looking up at the ceiling as though he
was pondering some intricate problem of kalsomining, and then fell upon Curly so suddenly
that the roadster had no excuses ready. Irresistibly, but so composedly that it seemed almost
absendmindedness on his part, the dispenser of drinks pushed Curly to the swinging doors
and kicked him out, with a nonchalance that almost amounted to sadness. That was the way
of the Southwest.
Curly arose from the gutter leisurely. He felt no anger or resentment toward his ejector.
Fifteen years of tramphood spent out of the twenty-two years of his life had hardened thefibres of his spirit. The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune fell blunted from the buckler
of his armoured pride. With especial resignation did he suffer contumely and injury at the
hands of bartenders. Naturally, they were his enemies; and unnaturally, they were often his
friends. He had to take his chances with them. But he had not yet learned to estimate these
cool, languid, Southwestern knights of the bungstarter, who had the manners of an Earl of
Pawtucket, and who, when they disapproved of your presence, moved you with the silence
and despatch of a chess automaton advancing a pawn.
Curly stood for a few moments in the narrow, mesquite-paved street. San Antonio
puzzled and disturbed him. Three days he had been a non- paying guest of the town, having
dropped off there from a box car of an I. &amp; G.N. freight, because Greaser Johnny had told
him in Des Moines that the Alamo City was manna fallen, gathered, cooked, and served free
with cream and sugar. Curly had found the tip partly a good one. There was hospitality in
plenty of a careless, liberal, irregular sort. But the town itself was a weight upon his spirits
after his experience with the rushing, business-like, systematised cities of the North and East.
Here he was often flung a dollar, but too frequently a good-natured kick would follow it.
Once a band of hilarious cowboys had roped him on Military Plaza and dragged him across
the black soil until no respectable rag-bag would have stood sponsor for his clothes. The
winding, doubling streets, leading nowhere, bewildered him. And then there was a little river,
crooked as a pot-hook, that crawled through the middle of the town, crossed by a hundred
little bridges so nearly alike that they got on Curly&rsquo;s nerves. And the last bartender wore a
number nine shoe.
The saloon stood on a corner. The hour was eight o&rsquo;clock. Homefarers and outgoers
jostled Curly on the narrow stone sidewalk. Between the buildings to his left he looked
down a cleft that proclaimed itself another thoroughfare. The alley was dark except for one
patch of light. Where there was light there were sure to be human beings. Where there
were human beings after nightfall in San Antonio there might be food, and there was sure to
be drink. So Curly headed for the light.
The illumination came from Schwegel&rsquo;s Cafe. On the sidewalk in front of it Curly picked
up an old envelope. It might have contained a check for a million. It was empty; but the
wanderer read the address, &ldquo;Mr. Otto Schwegel,&rdquo; and the name of the town and State. The
postmark was Detroit.
Curly entered the saloon. And now in the light it could be perceived that he bore the
stamp of many years of vagabondage. He had none of the tidiness of the calculating and
shrewd professional tramp. His wardrobe represented the cast-off specimens of half a dozen
fashions and eras. Two factories had combined their efforts in providing shoes for his feet. As
you gazed at him there passed through your mind vague impressions of mummies, wax
figures, Russian exiles, and men lost on desert islands. His face was covered almost to his
eyes with a curly brown beard that he kept trimmed short with a pocket-knife, and that had
furnished him with his nom de route. Light-blue eyes, full of sullenness, fear, cunning,
impudence, and fawning, witnessed the stress that had been laid upon his soul.The saloon was small, and in its atmosphere the odours of meat and drink struggled for
the ascendancy. The pig and the cabbage wrestled with hydrogen and oxygen. Behind the
bar Schwegel laboured with an assistant whose epidermal pores showed no signs of being
obstructed. Hot weinerwurst and sauerkraut were being served to purchasers of beer. Curly
shuffled to the end of the bar, coughed hollowly, and told Schwegel that he was a Detroit
cabinet-maker out of a job.
It followed as the night the day that he got his schooner and lunch.
&ldquo;Was you acquainted maybe with Heinrich Strauss in Detroit?&rdquo; asked Schwegel.
&ldquo;Did I know Heinrich Strauss?&rdquo; repeated Curly, affectionately. &ldquo;Why, say, &lsquo;Bo, I wish I
had a dollar for every game of pinochle me and Heine has played on Sunday afternoons.&rdquo;
More beer and a second plate of steaming food was set before the diplomat. And then
Curly, knowing to a fluid-drachm how far a &ldquo;con&rdquo; game would go, shuffled out into the
unpromising street.
And now he began to perceive the inconveniences of this stony Southern town. There
was none of the outdoor gaiety and brilliancy and music that provided distraction even to
the poorest in the cities of the North. Here, even so early, the gloomy, rock-walled houses
were closed and barred against the murky dampness of the night. The streets were mere
fissures through which flowed grey wreaths of river mist. As he walked he heard laughter
and the chink of coin and chips behind darkened windows, and music coming from every
chink of wood and stone. But the diversions were selfish; the day of popular pastimes had
not yet come to San Antonio.
But at length Curly, as he strayed, turned the sharp angle of another lost street and
came upon a rollicking band of stockmen from the outlying ranches celebrating in the open
in front of an ancient wooden hotel. One great roisterer from the sheep country who had
just instigated a movement toward the bar, swept Curly in like a stray goat with the rest of
his flock. The princes of kine and wool hailed him as a new zoological discovery, and
uproariously strove to preserve him in the diluted alcohol of their compliments and regards.
An hour afterward Curly staggered from the hotel barroom dismissed by his fickle
friends, whose interest in him had subsided as quickly as it had risen. Full&ndash;stoked with
alcoholic fuel and cargoed with food, the only question remaining to disturb him was that of
shelter and bed.
A drizzling, cold Texas rain had begun to fall&ndash;an endless, lazy, unintermittent downfall
that lowered the spirits of men and raised a reluctant steam from the warm stones of the
streets and houses. Thus comes the &ldquo;norther&rdquo; dousing gentle spring and amiable autumn
with the chilling salutes and adieux of coming and departing winter.Curly followed his nose down the first tortuous street into which his irresponsible feet
conducted him. At the lower end of it, on the bank of the serpentine stream, he perceived
an open gate in a cemented rock wall. Inside he saw camp fires and a row of low wooden
sheds built against three sides of the enclosing wall. He entered the enclosure. Under the
sheds many horses were champing at their oats and corn. Many wagons and buckboards
stood about with their teams&rsquo; harness thrown carelessly upon the shafts and doubletrees.
Curly recognised the place as a wagon-yard, such as is provided by merchants for their
out-of- town friends and customers. No one was in sight. No doubt the drivers of those
wagons were scattered about the town &ldquo;seeing the elephant and hearing the owl.&rdquo; In their
haste to become patrons of the town&rsquo;s dispensaries of mirth and good cheer the last ones to
depart must have left the great wooden gate swinging open.
Curly had satisfied the hunger of an anaconda and the thirst of a camel, so he was
neither in the mood nor the condition of an explorer. He zigzagged his way to the first wagon
that his eyesight distinguished in the semi-darkness under the shed. It was a two-horse
wagon with a top of white canvas. The wagon was half filled with loose piles of wool sacks,
two or three great bundles of grey blankets, and a number of bales, bundles, and boxes. A
reasoning eye would have estimated the load at once as ranch supplies, bound on the
morrow for some outlying hacienda. But to the drowsy intelligence of Curly they
represented only warmth and softness and protection against the cold humidity of the night.
After several unlucky efforts, at last he conquered gravity so far as to climb over a wheel and
pitch forward upon the best and warmest bed he had fallen upon in many a day. Then he
became instinctively a burrowing animal, and dug his way like a prairie-dog down among the
sacks and blankets, hiding himself from the cold air as snug and safe as a bear in his den. For
three nights sleep had visited Curly only in broken and shivering doses. So now, when
Morpheus condescended to pay him a call, Curly got such a strangle hold on the
mythological old gentleman that it was a wonder that anyone else in the whole world got a
wink of sleep that night.</p>

<hr />

<p>Six cowpunchers of the Cibolo Ranch were waiting around the door of the ranch store.
Their ponies cropped grass near by, tied in the Texas fashion&ndash;which is not tied at all. Their
bridle reins had been dropped to the earth, which is a more effectual way of securing them
(such is the power of habit and imagination) than you could devise out of a half-inch rope
and a live-oak tree.
These guardians of the cow lounged about, each with a brown cigarette paper in his
hand, and gently but unceasingly cursed Sam Revell, the storekeeper. Sam stood in the door,
snapping the red elastic bands on his pink madras shirtsleeves and looking down
affectionately at the only pair of tan shoes within a forty-mile radius. His offence had been
serious, and he was divided between humble apology and admiration for the beauty of his
raiment. He had allowed the ranch stock of &ldquo;smoking&rdquo; to become exhausted.&ldquo;I thought sure there was another case of it under the counter, boys,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;But it happened to be catterdges.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sure got a case of happenedicitis,&rdquo; said Poky Rodgers, fency rider of the Largo
Verde potrero. &ldquo;Somebody ought to happen to give you a knock on the head with the butt
end of a quirt. I&rsquo;ve rode in nine miles for some tobacco; and it don&rsquo;t appear natural and
seemly that you ought to be allowed to live.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The boys was smokin&rsquo; cut plug and dried mesquite leaves mixed when I left,&rdquo; sighed
Mustang Taylor, horse wrangler of the Three Elm camp. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be lookin&rsquo; for me back by
nine. They&rsquo;ll be settin&rsquo; up, with their papers ready to roll a whiff of the real thing before
bedtime. And I&rsquo;ve got to tell &lsquo;em that this pink-eyed, sheep-headed, sulphur- footed,
shirt-waisted son of a calico broncho, Sam Revell, hasn&rsquo;t got no tobacco on hand.&rdquo;
Gregorio Falcon, Mexican vaquero and best thrower of the rope on the Cibolo, pushed
his heavy, silver-embroidered straw sombrero back upon his thicket of jet black curls, and
scraped the bottoms of his pockets for a few crumbs of the precious weed.
&ldquo;Ah, Don Samuel,&rdquo; he said, reproachfully, but with his touch of Castilian manners,
&ldquo;escuse me. Dthey say dthe jackrabbeet and dthe sheep have dthe most leetle sesos&ndash;how
you call dthem&ndash;brain-es? Ah don&rsquo;t believe dthat, Don Samuel&ndash;escuse me. Ah dthink people
w&rsquo;at don&rsquo;t keep esmokin&rsquo; tobacco, dthey&ndash;bot you weel escuse me, Don Samuel.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Now, what&rsquo;s the use of chewin&rsquo; the rag, boys,&rdquo; said the untroubled Sam, stooping over
to rub the toes of his shoes with a red-and-yellow handkerchief. &ldquo;Ranse took the order for
some more smokin&rsquo; to San Antone with him Tuesday. Pancho rode Ranse&rsquo;s hoss back
yesterday; and Ranse is goin&rsquo; to drive the wagon back himself. There wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t much of a
load&ndash;just some woolsacks and blankets and nails and canned peaches and a few things we
was out of. I look for Ranse to roll in to-day sure. He&rsquo;s an early starter and a hell-to-split
driver, and he ought to be here not far from sundown.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What plugs is he drivin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Mustang Taylor, with a smack of hope in his tones.
&ldquo;The buckboard greys,&rdquo; said Sam.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait a spell, then,&rdquo; said the wrangler. &ldquo;Them plugs eat up a trail like a road-runner
swallowin&rsquo; a whip snake. And you may bust me open a can of greengage plums, Sam, while
I&rsquo;m waitin&rsquo; for somethin&rsquo; better.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Open me some yellow clings,&rdquo; ordered Poky Rodgers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait, too.&rdquo;
The tobaccoless punchers arranged themselves comfortably on the steps of the store.
Inside Sam chopped open with a hatchet the tops of the cans of fruit.The store, a big, white wooden building like a barn, stood fifty yards from the
ranch-house. Beyond it were the horse corrals; and still farther the wool sheds and the
brush-topped shearing pens&ndash;for the Rancho Cibolo raised both cattle and sheep. Behind the
store, at a little distance, were the grass-thatched jacals of the Mexicans who bestowed their
allegiance upon the Cibolo.
The ranch-house was composed of four large rooms, with plastered adobe walls, and a
two-room wooden ell. A twenty-feet-wide &ldquo;gallery&rdquo; circumvented the structure. It was set in
a grove of immense live-oaks and water-elms near a lake&ndash;a long, not very wide, and
tremendously deep lake in which at nightfall, great gars leaped to the surface and plunged
with the noise of hippopotamuses frolicking at their bath. From the trees hung garlands and
massive pendants of the melancholy grey moss of the South. Indeed, the Cibolo ranch-house
seemed more of the South than of the West. It looked as if old &ldquo;Kiowa&rdquo; Truesdell might have
brought it with him from the lowlands of Mississippi when he came to Texas with his rifle in
the hollow of his arm in &lsquo;55.
But, though he did not bring the family mansion, Truesdell did bring something in the
way of a family inheritance that was more lasting than brick or stone. He brought one end of
the Truesdell-Curtis family feud. And when a Curtis bought the Rancho de los Olmos, sixteen
miles from the Cibolo, there were lively times on the pear flats and in the chaparral thickets
off the Southwest. In those days Truesdell cleaned the brush of many a wolf and tiger cat
and Mexican lion; and one or two Curtises fell heirs to notches on his rifle stock. Also he
buried a brother with a Curtis bullet in him on the bank of the lake at Cibolo. And then the
Kiowa Indians made their last raid upon the ranches between the Frio and the Rio Grande,
and Truesdell at the head of his rangers rid the earth of them to the last brave, earning his
sobriquet. Then came prosperity in the form of waxing herds and broadening lands. And
then old age and bitterness, when he sat, with his great mane of hair as white as the
Spanish-dagger blossoms and his fierce, pale-blue eyes, on the shaded gallery at Cibolo,
growling like the pumas that he had slain. He snapped his fingers at old age; the bitter taste
to life did not come from that. The cup that stuck at his lips was that his only son Ransom
wanted to marry a Curtis, the last youthful survivor of the other end of the feud.</p>

<hr />

<p>For a while the only sounds to be heard at the store were the rattling of the tin spoons
and the gurgling intake of the juicy fruits by the cowpunchers, the stamping of the grazing
ponies, and the singing of a doleful song by Sam as he contentedly brushed his stiff auburn
hair for the twentieth time that day before a crinkly mirror.
From the door of the store could be seen the irregular, sloping stretch of prairie to the
south, with its reaches of light-green, billowy mesquite flats in the lower places, and its rises
crowned with nearly black masses of short chaparral. Through the mesquite flat wound the
ranch road that, five miles away, flowed into the old government trail to San Antonio. Thesun was so low that the gentlest elevation cast its grey shadow miles into the green-gold sea
of sunshine.
That evening ears were quicker than eyes.
The Mexican held up a tawny finger to still the scraping of tin against tin.
&ldquo;One waggeen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;cross dthe Arroyo Hondo. Ah hear dthe wheel. Verree rockee
place, dthe Hondo.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got good ears, Gregorio,&rdquo; said Mustang Taylor. &ldquo;I never heard nothin&rsquo; but the
song-bird in the bush and the zephyr skallyhootin&rsquo; across the peaceful dell.&rdquo;
In ten minutes Taylor remarked: &ldquo;I see the dust of a wagon risin&rsquo; right above the fur end
of the flat.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You have verree good eyes, senor,&rdquo; said Gregorio, smiling.
Two miles away they saw a faint cloud dimming the green ripples of the mesquites. In
twenty minutes they heard the clatter of the horses&rsquo; hoofs: in five minutes more the grey
plugs dashed out of the thicket, whickering for oats and drawing the light wagon behind
them like a toy.
From the jacals came a cry of: &ldquo;El Amo! El Amo!&rdquo; Four Mexican youths raced to
unharness the greys. The cowpunchers gave a yell of greeting and delight.
Ranse Truesdell, driving, threw the reins to the ground and laughed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s under the wagon sheet, boys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re waiting for. If Sam lets
it run out again we&rsquo;ll use those yellow shoes of his for a target. There&rsquo;s two cases. Pull &lsquo;em
out and light up. I know you all want a smoke.&rdquo;
After striking dry country Ranse had removed the wagon sheet from the bows and
thrown it over the goods in the wagon. Six pair of hasty hands dragged it off and grabbled
beneath the sacks and blankets for the cases of tobacco.
Long Collins, tobacco messenger from the San Gabriel outfit, who rode with the longest
stirrups west of the Mississippi, delved with an arm like the tongue of a wagon. He caught
something harder than a blanket and pulled out a fearful thing&ndash;a shapeless, muddy bunch
of leather tied together with wire and twine. From its ragged end, like the head and claws of
a disturbed turtle, protruded human toes.
&ldquo;Who-ee!&rdquo; yelled Long Collins. &ldquo;Ranse, are you a-packin&rsquo; around of corpuses? Here&rsquo;s
a&ndash;howlin&rsquo; grasshoppers!&ldquo;Up from his long slumber popped Curly, like some vile worm from its burrow. He clawed
his way out and sat blinking like a disreputable, drunken owl. His face was as bluish-red and
puffed and seamed and cross-lined as the cheapest round steak of the butcher. His eyes
were swollen slits; his nose a pickled beet; his hair would have made the wildest thatch of a
Jack-in-the-box look like the satin poll of a Cleo de Merode. The rest of him was scarecrow
done to the life.
Ranse jumped down from his seat and looked at his strange cargo with wide-open eyes.
&ldquo;Here, you maverick, what are you doing in my wagon? How did you get in there?&rdquo;
The punchers gathered around in delight. For the time they had forgotten tobacco.
Curly looked around him slowly in every direction. He snarled like a Scotch terrier
through his ragged beard.
&ldquo;Where is this?&rdquo; he rasped through his parched throat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a damn farm in an old field.
What&rsquo;d you bring me here for&ndash;say? Did I say I wanted to come here? What are you Reubs
rubberin&rsquo; at&ndash;hey? G&rsquo;wan or I&rsquo;ll punch some of yer faces.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Drag him out, Collins,&rdquo; said Ranse.
Curly took a slide and felt the ground rise up and collide with his shoulder blades. He
got up and sat on the steps of the store shivering from outraged nerves, hugging his knees
and sneering. Taylor lifted out a case of tobacco and wrenched off its top. Six cigarettes
began to glow, bringing peace and forgiveness to Sam.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you come in my wagon?&rdquo; repeated Ranse, this time in a voice that drew a reply.
Curly recognised the tone. He had heard it used by freight brakemen and large persons
in blue carrying clubs.
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Oh, was you talkin&rsquo; to me? Why, I was on my way to the Menger,
but my valet had forgot to pack my pyjamas. So I crawled into that wagon in the
wagon-yard&ndash;see? I never told you to bring me out to this bloomin&rsquo; farm&ndash;see?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What is it, Mustang?&rdquo; asked Poky Rodgers, almost forgetting to smoke in his ecstasy.
&ldquo;What do it live on?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a galliwampus, Poky,&rdquo; said Mustang. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the thing that hollers &lsquo;willi-walloo&rsquo; up in
ellum trees in the low grounds of nights. I don&rsquo;t know if it bites.&ldquo;&ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t, Mustang,&rdquo; volunteered Long Collins. &ldquo;Them galliwampuses has fins on
their backs, and eighteen toes. This here is a hicklesnifter. It lives under the ground and eats
cherries. Don&rsquo;t stand so close to it. It wipes out villages with one stroke of its prehensile
tail.&rdquo;
Sam, the cosmopolite, who called bartenders in San Antone by their first name, stood
in the door. He was a better zoologist.
&ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t that a Willie for your whiskers?&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you dig up the
hobo, Ranse? Goin&rsquo; to make an auditorium for inbreviates out of the ranch?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Curly, from whose panoplied breast all shafts of wit fell blunted. &ldquo;Any of you
kiddin&rsquo; guys got a drink on you? Have your fun. Say, I&rsquo;ve been hittin&rsquo; the stuff till I don&rsquo;t know
straight up.&rdquo;
He turned to Ranse. &ldquo;Say, you shanghaied me on your d&ndash;d old prairie schooner&ndash;did I
tell you to drive me to a farm? I want a drink. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; all to little pieces. What&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
Ranse saw that the tramp&rsquo;s nerves were racking him. He despatched one of the
Mexican boys to the ranch-house for a glass of whisky. Curly gulped it down; and into his
eyes came a brief, grateful glow&ndash;as human as the expression in the eye of a faithful setter
dog.
&ldquo;Thanky, boss,&rdquo; he said, quietly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thirty miles from a railroad, and forty miles from a saloon,&rdquo; said Ranse.
Curly fell back weakly against the steps.
&ldquo;Since you are here,&rdquo; continued the ranchman, &ldquo;come along with me. We can&rsquo;t turn
you out on the prairie. A rabbit might tear you to pieces.&rdquo;
He conducted Curly to a large shed where the ranch vehicles were kept. There he
spread out a canvas cot and brought blankets.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you can sleep,&rdquo; said Ranse, &ldquo;since you&rsquo;ve been pounding your ear for
twenty-four hours. But you can camp here till morning. I&rsquo;ll have Pedro fetch you up some
grub.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sleep!&rdquo; said Curly. &ldquo;I can sleep a week. Say, sport, have you got a coffin nail on you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fifty miles had Ransom Truesdell driven that day. And yet this is what he did.Old &ldquo;Kiowa&rdquo; Truesdell sat in his great wicker chair reading by the light of an immense oil
lamp. Ranse laid a bundle of newspapers fresh from town at his elbow.
&ldquo;Back, Ranse?&rdquo; said the old man, looking up.
&ldquo;Son,&rdquo; old &ldquo;Kiowa&rdquo; continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking all day about a certain matter that we
have talked about. I want you to tell me again. I&rsquo;ve lived for you. I&rsquo;ve fought wolves and
Indians and worse white men to protect you. You never had any mother that you can
remember. I&rsquo;ve taught you to shoot straight, ride hard, and live clean. Later on I&rsquo;ve worked to
pile up dollars that&rsquo;ll be yours. You&rsquo;ll be a rich man, Ranse, when my chunk goes out. I&rsquo;ve
made you. I&rsquo;ve licked you into shape like a leopard cat licks its cubs. You don&rsquo;t belong to
yourself &ndash;you&rsquo;ve got to be a Truesdell first. Now, is there to be any more nonsense about
this Curtis girl?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you once more,&rdquo; said Ranse, slowly. &ldquo;As I am a Truesdell and as you are my
father, I&rsquo;ll never marry a Curtis.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; said old &ldquo;Kiowa.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go get some supper.&rdquo;
Ranse went to the kitchen at the rear of the house. Pedro, the Mexican cook, sprang up
to bring the food he was keeping warm in the stove.
&ldquo;Just a cup of coffee, Pedro,&rdquo; he said, and drank it standing. And then:
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a tramp on a cot in the wagon-shed. Take him something to eat. Better make it
enough for two.&rdquo;
Ranse walked out toward the jacals. A boy came running.
&ldquo;Manuel, can you catch Vaminos, in the little pasture, for me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why not, senor? I saw him near the puerta but two hours past. He bears a drag-rope.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Get him and saddle him as quick as you can.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Prontito, senor.&rdquo;
Soon, mounted on Vaminos, Ranse leaned in the saddle, pressed with his knees, and
galloped eastward past the store, where sat Sam trying his guitar in the moonlight.
Vaminos shall have a word&ndash;Vaminos the good dun horse. The Mexicans, who have a
hundred names for the colours of a horse, called him gruyo. He was a mouse-coloured,
slate-coloured, flea-bitten roan- dun, if you can conceive it. Down his back from his mane tohis tail went a line of black. He would live forever; and surveyors have not laid off as many
miles in the world as he could travel in a day.
Eight miles east of the Cibolo ranch-house Ranse loosened the pressure of his knees,
and Vaminos stopped under a big ratama tree. The yellow ratama blossoms showered
fragrance that would have undone the roses of France. The moon made the earth a great
concave bowl with a crystal sky for a lid. In a glade five jack-rabbits leaped and played
together like kittens. Eight miles farther east shone a faint star that appeared to have
dropped below the horizon. Night riders, who often steered their course by it, knew it to be
the light in the Rancho de los Olmos.
In ten minutes Yenna Curtis galloped to the tree on her sorrel pony Dancer. The two
leaned and clasped hands heartily.
&ldquo;I ought to have ridden nearer your home,&rdquo; said Ranse. &ldquo;But you never will let me.&rdquo;
Yenna laughed. And in the soft light you could see her strong white teeth and fearless
eyes. No sentimentality there, in spite of the moonlight, the odour of the ratamas, and the
admirable figure of Ranse Truesdell, the lover. But she was there, eight miles from her home,
to meet him.
&ldquo;How often have I told you, Ranse,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I am your half-way girl? Always
half-way.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Ranse, with a question in his tones.
&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Yenna, with almost a sigh. &ldquo;I told him after dinner when I thought he would
be in a good humour. Did you ever wake up a lion, Ranse, with the mistaken idea that he
would be a kitten? He almost tore the ranch to pieces. It&rsquo;s all up. I love my daddy, Ranse, and
I&rsquo;m afraid&ndash;I&rsquo;m afraid of him too. He ordered me to promise that I&rsquo;d never marry a Truesdell. I
promised. That&rsquo;s all. What luck did you have?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said Ranse, slowly. &ldquo;I promised him that his son would never marry a Curtis.
Somehow I couldn&rsquo;t go against him. He&rsquo;s mighty old. I&rsquo;m sorry, Yenna.&rdquo;
The girl leaned in her saddle and laid one hand on Ranse&rsquo;s, on the horn of his saddle.
&ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d like you better for giving me up,&rdquo; she said ardently, &ldquo;but I do. I must
ride back now, Ranse. I slipped out of the house and saddled Dancer myself. Good-night,
neighbour.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said Ranse. &ldquo;Ride carefully over them badger holes.&ldquo;They wheeled and rode away in opposite directions. Yenna turned in her saddle and
called clearly:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget I&rsquo;m your half-way girl, Ranse.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Damn all family feuds and inherited scraps,&rdquo; muttered Ranse vindictively to the breeze
as he rode back to the Cibolo.
Ranse turned his horse into the small pasture and went to his own room. He opened
the lowest drawer of an old bureau to get out the packet of letters that Yenna had written
him one summer when she had gone to Mississippi for a visit. The drawer stuck, and he
yanked at it savagely&ndash;as a man will. It came out of the bureau, and bruised both his shins&ndash;as
a drawer will. An old, folded yellow letter without an envelope fell from
somewhere&ndash;probably from where it had lodged in one of the upper drawers. Ranse took it
to the lamp and read it curiously.
Then he took his hat and walked to one of the Mexican jacals.
&ldquo;Tia Juana,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I would like to talk with you a while.&rdquo;
An old, old Mexican woman, white-haired and wonderfully wrinkled, rose from a stool.
&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Ranse, removing his hat and taking the one chair in the jacal. &ldquo;Who am
I, Tia Juana?&rdquo; he asked, speaking Spanish.
&ldquo;Don Ransom, our good friend and employer. Why do you ask?&rdquo; answered the old
woman wonderingly.
&ldquo;Tia Juana, who am I?&rdquo; he repeated, with his stern eyes looking into hers.
A frightened look came in the old woman&rsquo;s face. She fumbled with her black shawl.
&ldquo;Who am I, Tia Juana?&rdquo; said Ranse once more.
&ldquo;Thirty-two years I have lived on the Rancho Cibolo,&rdquo; said Tia Juana. &ldquo;I thought to be
buried under the coma mott beyond the garden before these things should be known. Close
the door, Don Ransom, and I will speak. I see in your face that you know.&rdquo;
An hour Ranse spent behind Tia Juana&rsquo;s closed door. As he was on his way back to the
house Curly called to him from the wagon-shed.
The tramp sat on his cot, swinging his feet and smoking.&ldquo;Say, sport,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;This is no way to treat a man after kidnappin&rsquo; him. I went up
to the store and borrowed a razor from that fresh guy and had a shave. But that ain&rsquo;t all a
man needs. Say&ndash;can&rsquo;t you loosen up for about three fingers more of that booze? I never
asked you to bring me to your d&ndash;d farm.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Stand up out here in the light,&rdquo; said Ranse, looking at him closely.
Curly got up sullenly and took a step or two.
His face, now shaven smooth, seemed transformed. His hair had been combed, and it
fell back from the right side of his forehead with a peculiar wave. The moonlight charitably
softened the ravages of drink; and his aquiline, well-shaped nose and small, square cleft chin
almost gave distinction to his looks.
Ranse sat on the foot of the cot and looked at him curiously.
&ldquo;Where did you come from&ndash;have you got any home or folks anywhere?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Me? Why, I&rsquo;m a dook,&rdquo; said Curly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sir Reginald&ndash;oh, cheese it. No; I don&rsquo;t know
anything about my ancestors. I&rsquo;ve been a tramp ever since I can remember. Say, old pal, are
you going to set &lsquo;em up again to-night or not?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You answer my questions and maybe I will. How did you come to be a tramp?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; answered Curly. &ldquo;Why, I adopted that profession when I was an infant. Case of
had to. First thing I can remember, I belonged to a big, lazy hobo called Beefsteak Charley.
He sent me around to houses to beg. I wasn&rsquo;t hardly big enough to reach the latch of a gate.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Did he ever tell you how he got you?&rdquo; asked Ranse.
&ldquo;Once when he was sober he said he bought me for an old six-shooter and six bits from
a band of drunken Mexican sheep-shearers. But what&rsquo;s the diff? That&rsquo;s all I know.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Ranse. &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;re a maverick for certain. I&rsquo;m going to put the
Rancho Cibolo brand on you. I&rsquo;ll start you to work in one of the camps to-morrow.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Work!&rdquo; sniffed Curly, disdainfully. &ldquo;What do you take me for? Do you think I&rsquo;d chase
cows, and hop-skip-and-jump around after crazy sheep like that pink and yellow guy at the
store says these Reubs do? Forget it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll like it when you get used to it,&rdquo; said Ranse. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll send you up one more
drink by Pedro. I think you&rsquo;ll make a first-class cowpuncher before I get through with you.&ldquo;&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Curly. &ldquo;I pity the cows you set me to chaperon. They can go chase
themselves. Don&rsquo;t forget my nightcap, please, boss.&rdquo;
Ranse paid a visit to the store before going to the house. Sam Rivell was taking off his
tan shoes regretting and preparing for bed.
&ldquo;Any of the boys from the San Gabriel camp riding in early in the morning?&rdquo; asked
Ranse.
&ldquo;Long Collins,&rdquo; said Sam briefly. &ldquo;For the mail.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; said Ranse, &ldquo;to take that tramp out to camp with him and keep him till I get
there.&rdquo;
Curly was sitting on his blankets in the San Gabriel camp cursing talentedly when Ranse
Truesdell rode up and dismounted on the next afternoon. The cowpunchers were ignoring
the stray. He was grimy with dust and black dirt. His clothes were making their last stand in
favour of the conventions.
Ranse went up to Buck Rabb, the camp boss, and spoke briefly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a plumb buzzard,&rdquo; said Buck. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t work, and he&rsquo;s the low- downest passel of
inhumanity I ever see. I didn&rsquo;t know what you wanted done with him, Ranse, so I just let him
set. That seems to suit him. He&rsquo;s been condemned to death by the boys a dozen times, but I
told &lsquo;em maybe you was savin&rsquo; him for the torture.&rdquo;
Ranse took off his coat.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a hard job before me, Buck, I reckon, but it has to be done. I&rsquo;ve got to make a
man out of that thing. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve come to camp for.&rdquo;
He went up to Curly.
&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think if you had a bath it would allow you to take a seat in
the company of your fellow-man with less injustice to the atmosphere.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Run away, farmer,&rdquo; said Curly, sardonically. &ldquo;Willie will send for nursey when he feels
like having his tub.&rdquo;
The charco, or water hole, was twelve yards away. Ranse took one of Curly&rsquo;s ankles and
dragged him like a sack of potatoes to the brink. Then with the strength and sleight of a
hammer-throw he hurled the offending member of society far into the lake.
Curly crawled out and up the bank spluttering like a porpoise.Ranse met him with a piece of soap and a coarse towel in his hands.
&ldquo;Go to the other end of the lake and use this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Buck will give you some dry
clothes at the wagon.&rdquo;
The tramp obeyed without protest. By the time supper was ready he had returned to
camp. He was hardly to be recognised in his new shirt and brown duck clothes. Ranse
observed him out of the corner of his eye.
&ldquo;Lordy, I hope he ain&rsquo;t a coward,&rdquo; he was saying to himself. &ldquo;I hope he won&rsquo;t turn out to
be a coward.&rdquo;
His doubts were soon allayed. Curly walked straight to where he stood. His light-blue
eyes were blazing.
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m clean,&rdquo; he said meaningly, &ldquo;maybe you&rsquo;ll talk to me. Think you&rsquo;ve got a picnic
here, do you? You clodhoppers think you can run over a man because you know he can&rsquo;t get
away. All right. Now, what do you think of that?&rdquo;
Curly planted a stinging slap against Ranse&rsquo;s left cheek. The print of his hand stood out
a dull red against the tan.
Ranse smiled happily.
The cowpunchers talk to this day of the battle that followed.
Somewhere in his restless tour of the cities Curly had acquired the art of self-defence.
The ranchman was equipped only with the splendid strength and equilibrium of perfect
health and the endurance conferred by decent living. The two attributes nearly matched.
There were no formal rounds. At last the fibre of the clean liver prevailed. The last time Curly
went down from one of the ranchman&rsquo;s awkward but powerful blows he remained on the
grass, but looking up with an unquenched eye.
Ranse went to the water barrel and washed the red from a cut on his chin in the stream
from the faucet.
On his face was a grin of satisfaction.
Much benefit might accrue to educators and moralists if they could know the details of
the curriculum of reclamation through which Ranse put his waif during the month that he
spent in the San Gabriel camp. The ranchman had no fine theories to work out&ndash;perhaps his
whole stock of pedagogy embraced only a knowledge of horse-breaking and a belief in
heredity.The cowpunchers saw that their boss was trying to make a man out of the strange
animal that he had sent among them; and they tacitly organised themselves into a faculty of
assistants. But their system was their own.
Curly&rsquo;s first lesson stuck. He became on friendly and then on intimate terms with soap
and water. And the thing that pleased Ranse most was that his &ldquo;subject&rdquo; held his ground at
each successive higher step. But the steps were sometimes far apart.
Once he got at the quart bottle of whisky kept sacredly in the grub tent for rattlesnake
bites, and spent sixteen hours on the grass, magnificently drunk. But when he staggered to
his feet his first move was to find his soap and towel and start for the charco. And once,
when a treat came from the ranch in the form of a basket of fresh tomatoes and young
onions, Curly devoured the entire consignment before the punchers reached the camp at
supper time.
And then the punchers punished him in their own way. For three days they did not
speak to him, except to reply to his own questions or remarks. And they spoke with absolute
and unfailing politeness. They played tricks on one another; they pounded one another
hurtfully and affectionately; they heaped upon one another&rsquo;s heads friendly curses and
obloquy; but they were polite to Curly. He saw it, and it stung him as much as Ranse hoped it
would.
Then came a night that brought a cold, wet norther. Wilson, the youngest of the outfit,
had lain in camp two days, ill with fever. When Joe got up at daylight to begin breakfast he
found Curly sitting asleep against a wheel of the grub wagon with only a saddle blanket
around him, while Curly&rsquo;s blankets were stretched over Wilson to protect him from the rain
and wind.
Three nights after that Curly rolled himself in his blanket and went to sleep. Then the
other punchers rose up softly and began to make preparations. Ranse saw Long Collins tie a
rope to the horn of a saddle. Others were getting out their six-shooters.
&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said Ranse, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged. I was hoping you would. But I didn&rsquo;t like to ask.&rdquo;
Half a dozen six-shooters began to pop&ndash;awful yells rent the air&ndash;Long Collins galloped
wildly across Curly&rsquo;s bed, dragging the saddle after him. That was merely their way of gently
awaking their victim. Then they hazed him for an hour, carefully and ridiculously, after the
code of cow camps. Whenever he uttered protest they held him stretched over a roll of
blankets and thrashed him woefully with a pair of leather leggings.
And all this meant that Curly had won his spurs, that he was receiving the puncher&rsquo;s
accolade. Nevermore would they be polite to him. But he would be their &ldquo;pardner&rdquo; and
stirrup-brother, foot to foot.When the fooling was ended all hands made a raid on Joe&rsquo;s big coffee- pot by the fire
for a Java nightcap. Ranse watched the new knight carefully to see if he understood and was
worthy. Curly limped with his cup of coffee to a log and sat upon it. Long Collins followed
and sat by his side. Buck Rabb went and sat at the other. Curly&ndash;grinned.
And then Ranse furnished Curly with mounts and saddle and equipment, and turned
him over to Buck Rabb, instructing him to finish the job.
Three weeks later Ranse rode from the ranch into Rabb&rsquo;s camp, which was then in
Snake Valley. The boys were saddling for the day&rsquo;s ride. He sought out Long Collins among
them.
&ldquo;How about that bronco?&rdquo; he asked.
Long Collins grinned.
&ldquo;Reach out your hand, Ranse Truesdell,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll touch him. And you can
shake his&rsquo;n, too, if you like, for he&rsquo;s plumb white and there&rsquo;s none better in no camp.&rdquo;
Ranse looked again at the clear-faced, bronzed, smiling cowpuncher who stood at
Collins&rsquo;s side. Could that be Curly? He held out his hand, and Curly grasped it with the
muscles of a bronco-buster.
&ldquo;I want you at the ranch,&rdquo; said Ranse.
&ldquo;All right, sport,&rdquo; said Curly, heartily. &ldquo;But I want to come back again. Say, pal, this is a
dandy farm. And I don&rsquo;t want any better fun than hustlin&rsquo; cows with this bunch of guys.
They&rsquo;re all to the merry- merry.&rdquo;
At the Cibolo ranch-house they dismounted. Ranse bade Curly wait at the door of the
living room. He walked inside. Old &ldquo;Kiowa&rdquo; Truesdell was reading at a table.
&ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Truesdell,&rdquo; said Ranse.
The old man turned his white head quickly.
&ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Why do you call me &lsquo;Mr.&ndash;&rsquo;?&rdquo;
When he looked at Ranse&rsquo;s face he stopped, and the hand that held his newspaper
shook slightly.
&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;how did you find it out?&rdquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Ranse, with a smile. &ldquo;I made Tia Juana tell me. It was kind of by
accident, but it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been like a son to me,&rdquo; said old &ldquo;Kiowa,&rdquo; trembling.
&ldquo;Tia Juana told me all about it,&rdquo; said Ranse. &ldquo;She told me how you adopted me when I
was knee-high to a puddle duck out of a wagon train of prospectors that was bound West.
And she told me how the kid&ndash;your own kid, you know&ndash;got lost or was run away with. And
she said it was the same day that the sheep-shearers got on a bender and left the ranch.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Our boy strayed from the house when he was two years old,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;And
then along came those emigrant wagons with a youngster they didn&rsquo;t want; and we took
you. I never intended you to know, Ranse. We never heard of our boy again.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right outside, unless I&rsquo;m mighty mistaken,&rdquo; said Ranse, opening the door and
beckoning.
Curly walked in.
No one could have doubted. The old man and the young had the same sweep of hair,
the same nose, chin, line of face, and prominent light- blue eyes.
Old &ldquo;Kiowa&rdquo; rose eagerly.
Curly looked about the room curiously. A puzzled expression came over his face. He
pointed to the wall opposite.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the tick-tock?&rdquo; he asked, absent-mindedly.
&ldquo;The clock,&rdquo; cried old &ldquo;Kiowa&rdquo; loudly. &ldquo;The eight-day clock used to stand there. Why&ndash;&rdquo;
He turned to Ranse, but Ranse was not there.
Already a hundred yards away, Vaminos, the good flea-bitten dun, was bearing him
eastward like a racer through dust and chaparral towards the Rancho de los Olmos.

<p>IWhere to go for wisdom has become a question of serious import. The ancients are
discredited; Plato is boiler-plate; Aristotle is tottering; Marcus Aurelius is reeling; Aesop has
been copyrighted by Indiana; Solomon is too solemn; you couldn&rsquo;t get anything out of
Epictetus with a pick.
The ant, which for many years served as a model of intelligence and industry in the
school-readers, has been proven to be a doddering idiot and a waster of time and effort. The
owl to-day is hooted at. Chautauqua conventions have abandoned culture and adopted
diabolo. Graybeards give glowing testimonials to the venders of patent hair- restorers. There
are typographical errors in the almanacs published by the daily newspapers. College
professors have become&ndash;
But there shall be no personalities. To sit in classes, to delve into the encyclopedia or
the past-performances page, will not make us wise. As the poet says, &ldquo;Knowledge comes,
but wisdom lingers.&rdquo; Wisdom is dew, which, while we know it not, soaks into us, refreshes
us, and makes us grow. Knowledge is a strong stream of water turned on us through a hose.
It disturbs our roots.
Then, let us rather gather wisdom. But how to do so requires knowledge. If we know a
thing, we know it; but very often we are not wise to it that we are wise, and&ndash;
But let&rsquo;s go on with the story.
II
Once upon a time I found a ten-cent magazine lying on a bench in a little city park.
Anyhow, that was the amount he asked me for when I sat on the bench next to him. He was
a musty, dingy, and tattered magazine, with some queer stories bound in him, I was sure. He
turned out to be a scrap-book.
&ldquo;I am a newspaper reporter,&rdquo; I said to him, to try him. &ldquo;I have been detailed to write up
some of the experiences of the unfortunate ones who spend their evenings in this park. May
I ask you to what you attribute your downfall in&ndash;&rdquo;
I was interrupted by a laugh from my purchase&ndash;a laugh so rusty and unpractised that I
was sure it had been his first for many a day.
&ldquo;Oh, no, no,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t a reporter. Reporters don&rsquo;t talk that way. They pretend
to be one of us, and say they&rsquo;ve just got in on the blind baggage from St. Louis. I can tell a
reporter on sight. Us park bums get to be fine judges of human nature. We sit here all day
and watch the people go by. I can size up anybody who walks past my bench in a way that
would surprise you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;go on and tell me. How do you size me up?&rdquo;&ldquo;I should say,&rdquo; said the student of human nature with unpardonable hesitation, &ldquo;that
you was, say, in the contracting business&ndash;or maybe worked in a store&ndash;or was a sign-painter.
You stopped in the park to finish your cigar, and thought you&rsquo;d get a little free monologue
out of me. Still, you might be a plasterer or a lawyer&ndash;it&rsquo;s getting kind of dark, you see. And
your wife won&rsquo;t let you smoke at home.&rdquo;
I frowned gloomily.
&ldquo;But, judging again,&rdquo; went on the reader of men, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say you ain&rsquo;t got a wife.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, rising restlessly. &ldquo;No, no, no, I ain&rsquo;t. But I will have, by the arrows of Cupid!
That is, if&ndash;&rdquo;
My voice must have trailed away and muffled itself in uncertainty and despair.
&ldquo;I see you have a story yourself,&rdquo; said the dusty vagrant&ndash;impudently, it seemed to me.
&ldquo;Suppose you take your dime back and spin your yarn for me. I&rsquo;m interested myself in the
ups and downs of unfortunate ones who spend their evenings in the park.&rdquo;
Somehow, that amused me. I looked at the frowsy derelict with more interest. I did
have a story. Why not tell it to him? I had told none of my friends. I had always been a
reserved and bottled-up man. It was psychical timidity or sensitiveness-perhaps both. And I
smiled to myself in wonder when I felt an impulse to confide in this stranger and vagabond.
&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Mack,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Mack,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do you want the dime back in advance ?&rdquo; said he.
I handed him a dollar.
&ldquo;The dime,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;was the price of listening to your story.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Right on the point of the jaw,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
And then, incredible as it may seem to the lovers in the world who confide their
sorrows only to the night wind and the gibbous moon, I laid bare my secret to that wreck of
all things that you would have supposed to be in sympathy with love.I told him of the days and weeks and months that I had spent in adoring Mildred Telfair.
I spoke of my despair, my grievous days and wakeful nights, my dwindling hopes and distress
of mind. I even pictured to this night-prowler her beauty and dignity, the great sway she had
in society, and the magnificence of her life as the elder daughter of an ancient race whose
pride overbalanced the dollars of the city&rsquo;s millionaires.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you cop the lady out?&rdquo; asked Mack, bringing me down to earth and dialect
again.
I explained to him that my worth was so small, my income so minute, and my fears so
large that I hadn&rsquo;t the courage to speak to her of my worship. I told him that in her presence
I could only blush and stammer, and that she looked upon me with a wonderful, maddening
smile of amusement.
&ldquo;She kind of moves in the professional class, don&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; asked Mack.
&ldquo;The Telfair family&ndash;&rdquo; I began, haughtily.
&ldquo;I mean professional beauty,&rdquo; said my hearer.
&ldquo;She is greatly and widely admired,&rdquo; I answered, cautiously.
&ldquo;Any sisters?&rdquo;
&ldquo;One.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You know any more girls?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, several,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;And a few others.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Mack, &ldquo;tell me one thing&ndash;can you hand out the dope to other girls? Can you
chin &lsquo;em and make matinee eyes at &lsquo;em and squeeze &lsquo;em? You know what I mean. You&rsquo;re
just shy when it comes to this particular dame&ndash;the professional beauty&ndash;ain&rsquo;t that right ?&rdquo;
&ldquo;In a way you have outlined the situation with approximate truth,&rdquo; I admitted.
&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said Mack, grimly. &ldquo;Now, that reminds me of my own case. I&rsquo;ll tell you
about it.&rdquo;
I was indignant, but concealed it. What was this loafer&rsquo;s case or anybody&rsquo;s case
compared with mine? Besides, I had given him a dollar and ten cents.&ldquo;Feel my muscle,&rdquo; said my companion, suddenly, flexing his biceps. I did so
mechanically. The fellows in gyms are always asking you to do that. His arm was as hard as
cast-iron.
&ldquo;Four years ago,&rdquo; said Mack, &ldquo;I could lick any man in New York outside of the
professional ring. Your case and mine is just the same. I come from the West Side&ndash;between
Thirtieth and Fourteenth&ndash;I won&rsquo;t give the number on the door. I was a scrapper when I was
ten, and when I was twenty no amateur in the city could stand up four rounds with me. &rsquo;S a
fact. You know Bill McCarty? No? He managed the smokers for some of them swell clubs.
Well, I knocked out everything Bill brought up before me. I was a middle-weight, but could
train down to a welter when necessary. I boxed all over the West Side at bouts and benefits
and private entertainments, and was never put out once.
&ldquo;But, say, the first time I put my foot in the ring with a professional I was no more than
a canned lobster. I dunno how it was- -I seemed to lose heart. I guess I got too much
imagination. There was a formality and publieness about it that kind of weakened my nerve.
I never won a fight in the ring. Light-weights and all kinds of scrubs used to sign up with my
manager and then walk up and tap me on the wrist and see me fall. The minute I seen the
crowd and a lot of gents in evening clothes down in front, and seen a professional come
inside the ropes, I got as weak as ginger-ale.
&ldquo;Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t long till I couldn&rsquo;t get no backers, and I didn&rsquo;t have any more
chances to fight a professional&ndash;or many amateurs, either. But lemme tell you&ndash;I was as good
as most men inside the ring or out. It was just that dumb, dead feeling I had when I was up
against a regular that always done me up.
&ldquo;Well, sir, after I had got out of the business, I got a mighty grouch on. I used to go
round town licking private citizens and all kinds of unprofessionals just to please myself. I&rsquo;d
lick cops in dark streets and car-conductors and cab-drivers and draymen whenever I could
start a row with &lsquo;em. It didn&rsquo;t make any difference how big they were, or how much science
they had, I got away with &lsquo;em. If I&rsquo;d only just have had the confidence in the ring that I had
beating up the best men outside of it, I&rsquo;d be wearing black pearls and heliotrope silk socks
to-day.
&ldquo;One evening I was walking along near the Bowery, thinking about things, when along
comes a slumming-party. About six or seven they was, all in swallowtails, and these silk hats
that don&rsquo;t shine. One of the gang kind of shoves me off the sidewalk. I hadn&rsquo;t had a scrap in
three days, and I just says, &lsquo;De-lighted!&rsquo; and hits him back of the ear.
&ldquo;Well, we had it. That Johnnie put up as decent a little fight as you&rsquo;d want to see in the
moving pictures. It was on a side street, and no cops around. The other guy had a lot of
science, but it only took me about six minutes to lay him out.&ldquo;Some of the swallowtails dragged him up against some steps and began to fan him.
Another one of &lsquo;em comes over to me and says:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Young man, do you know what you&rsquo;ve done?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, beat it,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done nothing but a little punching-bag work. Take Freddy back
to Yale and tell him to quit studying sociology on the wrong side of the sidewalk.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;My good fellow,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you are, but I&rsquo;d like to. You&rsquo;ve knocked out
Reddy Burns, the champion middle-weight of the world! He came to New York yesterday, to
try to get a match on with Jim Jeifries. If you&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;But when I come out of my faint I was laying on the floor in a drug- store saturated
with aromatic spirits of ammonia. If I&rsquo;d known that was Reddy Burns, I&rsquo;d have got down in
the gutter and crawled past him instead of handing him one like I did. Why, if I&rsquo;d ever been
in a ring and seen him climbing over the ropes, I&rsquo;d have been all to the sal volatile.
&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what imagination does,&rdquo; concluded Mack. &ldquo;And, as I said, your case and mine
is simultaneous. You&rsquo;ll never win out. You can&rsquo;t go up against the professionals. I tell you, it&rsquo;s
a park bench for yours in this romance business.&rdquo;
Mack, the pessimist, laughed harshly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t see the parallel,&rdquo; I said, coldly. &ldquo;I have only a very slight acquaintance
with the prize-ring.&rdquo;
The derelict touched my sleeve with his forefinger, for emphasis, as he explained his
parable.
&ldquo;Every man,&rdquo; said he, with some dignity, &ldquo;has got his lamps on something that looks
good to him. With you, it&rsquo;s this dame that you&rsquo;re afraid to say your say to. With me, it was to
win out in the ring. Well, you&rsquo;ll lose just like I did.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why do you think I shall lose?&rdquo; I asked warmly.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re afraid to go in the ring. You dassen&rsquo;t stand up before a
professional. Your case and mine is just the same. You&rsquo;re a amateur; and that means that
you&rsquo;d better keep outside of the ropes.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, I must be going,&rdquo; I said, rising and looking with elaborate care at my watch.
When I was twenty feet away the park-bencher called to me.&ldquo;Much obliged for the dollar,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And for the dime. But you&rsquo;ll never get &lsquo;er. You&rsquo;re
in the amateur class.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Serves you right,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;for hobnobbing with a tramp. His impudence!&rdquo;
But, as I walked, his words seemed to repeat themselves over and over again in my
brain. I think I even grew angry at the man.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show him!&rdquo; I finally said, aloud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show him that I can fight Reddy Burns,
too&ndash;even knowing who he is.&rdquo;
I hurried to a telephone-booth and rang up the Telfair residence.
A soft, sweet voice answered. Didn&rsquo;t I know that voice? My hand holding the receiver
shook.
&ldquo;Is that you?&rdquo; said I, employing the foolish words that form the vocabulary of every
talker through the telephone.
&ldquo;Yes, this is I,&rdquo; came back the answer in the low, clear-cut tones that are an inheritance
of the Telfairs. &ldquo;Who is it, please?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; said I, less ungrammatically than egotistically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, and I&rsquo;ve got a few
things that I want to say to you right now and immediately and straight to the point.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Mr. Arden!&rdquo;
I wondered if any accent on the first word was intended; Mildred was fine at saying
things that you had to study out afterward.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I hope so. And now to come down to brass tacks.&rdquo; I thought that rather a
vernacularism, if there is such a word, as soon as I had said it; but I didn&rsquo;t stop to apologize.
&ldquo;You know, of course, that I love you, and that I have been in that idiotic state for a long time.
I don&rsquo;t want any more foolishness about it&ndash;that is, I mean I want an answer from you right
now. Will you marry me or not? Hold the wire, please. Keep out, Central. Hello, hello! Will
you, or will you not.?&rdquo;
That was just the uppercut for Reddy Burns&rsquo; chin. The answer came back:
&ldquo;Why, Phil, dear, of course I will! I didn&rsquo;t know that you&ndash;that is, you never said&ndash;oh,
come up to the house, please&ndash;I can&rsquo;t say what I want to over the &lsquo;phone. You are so
importunate. But please come up to the house, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
Would I?I rang the bell of the Telfair house violently. Some sort of a human came to the door
and shooed me into the drawing-room.
&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said I to myself, looking at the ceiling, &ldquo;any one can learn from any one. That
was a pretty good philosophy of Mack&rsquo;s, anyhow. He didn&rsquo;t take advantage of his experience,
but I get the benefit of it. If you want to get into the professional class, you&rsquo;ve got to&ndash;&rdquo;
I stopped thinking then. Some one was coming down the stairs. My knees began to
shake. I knew then how Mack had felt when a professional began to climb over the ropes.
I looked around foolishly for a door or a window by which I might escape. If it had been
any other girl approaching, I mightn&rsquo;t have&ndash; But just then the door opened, and Bess,
Mildred&rsquo;s younger sister, came in. I&rsquo;d never seen her look so much like a glorified angel. She
walked straight tip to me, and&ndash;and&ndash;I&rsquo;d never noticed before what perfectly wonderful eyes
and hair Elizabeth Telfair had.
&ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; she said, in the Telfair, sweet, thrilling tones, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you tell me about it
before? I thought it was sister you wanted all the time, until you telephoned to me a few
minutes ago!&rdquo;
I suppose Mack and I always will be hopeless amateurs. But, as the thing has turned out
in my case, I&rsquo;m mighty glad of it.
Hygeia at the Solito （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>If you are knowing in the chronicles of the ring you will recall to mind an event in the
early &lsquo;nineties when, for a minute and sundry odd seconds, a champion and a &ldquo;would-be&rdquo;
faced each other on the alien side of an international river. So brief a conflict had rarely
imposed upon the fair promise of true sport. The reporters made what they could of it, but,
divested of padding, the action was sadly fugacious. The champion merely smote his victim,
turned his back upon him, remarking, &ldquo;I know what I done to dat stiff,&rdquo; and extended an arm
like a ship&rsquo;s mast for his glove to be removed.
Which accounts for a trainload of extremely disgusted gentlemen in an uproar of fancy
vests and neck-wear being spilled from their pullmans in San Antonio in the early morning
following the fight. Which also partly accounts for the unhappy predicament in which
&ldquo;Cricket&rdquo; McGuire found himself as he tumbled from his car and sat upon the depot
platform, torn by a spasm of that hollow, racking cough so familiar to San Antonian ears. Atthat time, in the uncertain light of dawn, that way passed Curtis Raidler, the Nueces County
cattleman&ndash;may his shadow never measure under six foot two.
The cattleman, out this early to catch the south-bound for his ranch station, stopped at
the side of the distressed patron of sport, and spoke in the kindly drawl of his ilk and region,
&ldquo;Got it pretty bad, bud?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cricket&rdquo; McGuire, ex-feather-weight prizefighter, tout, jockey, follower of the &ldquo;ponies,&rdquo;
all-round sport, and manipulator of the gum balls and walnut shells, looked up pugnaciously
at the imputation cast by &ldquo;bud.&rdquo;
&ldquo;G&rsquo;wan,&rdquo; he rasped, &ldquo;telegraph pole. I didn&rsquo;t ring for yer.&rdquo;
Another paroxysm wrung him, and he leaned limply against a convenient baggage truck.
Raidler waited patiently, glancing around at the white hats, short overcoats, and big cigars
thronging the platform. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re from the No&rsquo;th, ain&rsquo;t you, bud?&rdquo; he asked when the other
was partially recovered. &ldquo;Come down to see the fight?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fight!&rdquo; snapped McGuire. &ldquo;Puss-in-the-corner! &lsquo;Twas a hypodermic injection. Handed
him just one like a squirt of dope, and he&rsquo;s asleep, and no tanbark needed in front of his
residence. Fight!&rdquo; He rattled a bit, coughed, and went on, hardly addressing the cattleman,
but rather for the relief of voicing his troubles. &ldquo;No more dead sure t&rsquo;ings for me. But Rus
Sage himself would have snatched at it. Five to one dat de boy from Cork wouldn&rsquo;t stay t&rsquo;ree
rounds is what I invested in. Put my last cent on, and could already smell the sawdust in dat
all-night joint of Jimmy Delaney&rsquo;s on T&rsquo;irty-seventh Street I was goin&rsquo; to buy. And den&ndash;say,
telegraph pole, what a gazaboo a guy is to put his whole roll on one turn of the gaboozlum!&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re plenty right,&rdquo; said the big cattleman; &ldquo;more &lsquo;specially when you lose. Son, you
get up and light out for a hotel. You got a mighty bad cough. Had it long?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lungs,&rdquo; said McGuire comprehensively. &ldquo;I got it. The croaker says I&rsquo;ll come to time for
six months longer&ndash;maybe a year if I hold my gait. I wanted to settle down and take care of
myself. Dat&rsquo;s why I speculated on dat five to one perhaps. I had a t&rsquo;ousand iron dollars saved
up. If I winned I was goin&rsquo; to buy Delaney&rsquo;s cafe. Who&rsquo;d a t&rsquo;ought dat stiff would take a nap
in de foist round&ndash;say?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard deal,&rdquo; commented Raidler, looking down at the diminutive form of McGuire
crumpled against the truck. &ldquo;But you go to a hotel and rest. There&rsquo;s the Menger and the
Maverick, and&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;And the Fi&rsquo;th Av&rsquo;noo, and the Waldorf-Astoria,&rdquo; mimicked McGuire. &ldquo;Told you I went
broke. I&rsquo;m on de bum proper. I&rsquo;ve got one dime left. Maybe a trip to Europe or a sail in me
private yacht would fix me up&ndash; pa-per!&ldquo;He flung his dime at a newsboy, got his Express, propped his back against the truck, and
was at once rapt in the account of his Waterloo, as expanded by the ingenious press.
Curtis Raidler interrogated an enormous gold watch, and laid his hand on McGuire&rsquo;s
shoulder.
&ldquo;Come on, bud,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We got three minutes to catch the train.&rdquo;
Sarcasm seemed to be McGuire&rsquo;s vein.
&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t seen me cash in any chips or call a turn since I told you I was broke, a minute
ago, have you? Friend, chase yourself away.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going down to my ranch,&rdquo; said the cattleman, &ldquo;and stay till you get well. Six
months&rsquo;ll fix you good as new.&rdquo; He lifted McGuire with one hand, and half-dragged him in
the direction of the train.
&ldquo;What about the money?&rdquo; said McGuire, struggling weakly to escape.
&ldquo;Money for what?&rdquo; asked Raidler, puzzled. They eyed each other, not understanding,
for they touched only as at the gear of bevelled cog- wheels&ndash;at right angles, and moving
upon different axes.
Passengers on the south-bound saw them seated together, and wondered at the
conflux of two such antipodes. McGuire was five feet one, with a countenance belonging to
either Yokohama or Dublin. Bright-beady of eye, bony of cheek and jaw, scarred, toughened,
broken and reknit, indestructible, grisly, gladiatorial as a hornet, he was a type neither new
nor unfamiliar. Raidler was the product of a different soil. Six feet two in height, miles broad,
and no deeper than a crystal brook, he represented the union of the West and South. Few
accurate pictures of his kind have been made, for art galleries are so small and the
mutoscope is as yet unknown in Texas. After all, the only possible medium of portrayal of
Raidler&rsquo;s kind would be the fresco&ndash;something high and simple and cool and unframed.
They were rolling southward on the International. The timber was huddling into little,
dense green motts at rare distances before the inundation of the downright, vert prairies.
This was the land of the ranches; the domain of the kings of the kine.
McGuire sat, collapsed into his corner of the seat, receiving with acid suspicion the
conversation of the cattleman. What was the &ldquo;game&rdquo; of this big &ldquo;geezer&rdquo; who was carrying
him off? Altruism would have been McGuire&rsquo;s last guess. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t no farmer,&rdquo; thought the
captive, &ldquo;and he ain&rsquo;t no con man, for sure. W&rsquo;at&rsquo;s his lay? You trail in, Cricket, and see how
many cards he draws. You&rsquo;re up against it, anyhow. You got a nickel and gallopin&rsquo;
consumption, and you better lay low. Lay low and see w&rsquo;at&rsquo;s his game.&ldquo;At Rincon, a hundred miles from San Antonio, they left the train for a buckboard which
was waiting there for Raidler. In this they travelled the thirty miles between the station and
their destination. If anything could, this drive should have stirred the acrimonious McGuire
to a sense of his ransom. They sped upon velvety wheels across an exhilarant savanna. The
pair of Spanish ponies struck a nimble, tireless trot, which gait they occasionally relieved by
a wild, untrammelled gallop. The air was wine and seltzer, perfumed, as they absorbed it,
with the delicate redolence of prairie flowers. The road perished, and the buckboard swam
the uncharted billows of the grass itself, steered by the practised hand of Raidler, to whom
each tiny distant mott of trees was a signboard, each convolution of the low hills a voucher
of course and distance. But McGuire reclined upon his spine, seeing nothing but a desert,
and receiving the cattleman&rsquo;s advances with sullen distrust. &ldquo;W&rsquo;at&rsquo;s he up to?&rdquo; was the
burden of his thoughts; &ldquo;w&rsquo;at kind of a gold brick has the big guy got to sell?&rdquo; McGuire was
only applying the measure of the streets he had walked to a range bounded by the horizon
and the fourth dimension.
A week before, while riding the prairies, Raidler had come upon a sick and weakling calf
deserted and bawling. Without dismounting he had reached and slung the distressed bossy
across his saddle, and dropped it at the ranch for the boys to attend to. It was impossible for
McGuire to know or comprehend that, in the eyes of the cattleman, his case and that of the
calf were identical in interest and demand upon his assistance. A creature was ill and
helpless; he had the power to render aid&ndash;these were the only postulates required for the
cattleman to act. They formed his system of logic and the most of his creed. McGuire was
the seventh invalid whom Raidler had picked up thus casually in San Antonio, where so
many thousand go for the ozone that is said to linger about its contracted streets. Five of
them had been guests of Solito Ranch until they had been able to leave, cured or better, and
exhausting the vocabulary of tearful gratitude. One came too late, but rested very
comfortably, at last, under a ratama tree in the garden.
So, then, it was no surprise to the ranchhold when the buckboard spun to the door, and
Raidler took up his debile protege like a handful of rags and set him down upon the gallery.
McGuire looked upon things strange to him. The ranch-house was the best in the
country. It was built of brick hauled one hundred miles by wagon, but it was of but one story,
and its four rooms were completely encircled by a mud floor &ldquo;gallery.&rdquo; The miscellaneous
setting of horses, dogs, saddles, wagons, guns, and cow-punchers&rsquo; paraphernalia oppressed
the metropolitan eyes of the wrecked sportsman.
&ldquo;Well, here we are at home,&rdquo; said Raidler, cheeringly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a h&ndash;l of a looking place,&rdquo; said McGuire promptly, as he rolled upon the gallery floor
in a fit of coughing.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try to make it comfortable for you, buddy,&rdquo; said the cattleman gently. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t
fine inside; but it&rsquo;s the outdoors, anyway, that&rsquo;ll do you the most good. This&rsquo;ll be your room,
in here. Anything we got, you ask for it.&rdquo;
He led McGuire into the east room. The floor was bare and clean. White curtains waved
in the gulf breeze through the open windows. A big willow rocker, two straight chairs, a long
table covered with newspapers, pipes, tobacco, spurs, and cartridges stood in the centre.
Some well-mounted heads of deer and one of an enormous black javeli projected from the
walls. A wide, cool cot-bed stood in a corner. Nueces County people regarded this guest
chamber as fit for a prince. McGuire showed his eyeteeth at it. He took out his nickel and
spun it up to the ceiling.
&ldquo;T&rsquo;ought I was lyin&rsquo; about the money, did ye? Well, you can frisk me if you wanter. Dat&rsquo;s
the last simoleon in the treasury. Who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to pay?&rdquo;
The cattleman&rsquo;s clear grey eyes looked steadily from under his grizzly brows into the
huckleberry optics of his guest. After a little he said simply, and not ungraciously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
much obliged to you, son, if you won&rsquo;t mention money any more. Once was quite a plenty.
Folks I ask to my ranch don&rsquo;t have to pay anything, and they very scarcely ever offers it.
Supper&rsquo;ll be ready in half an hour. There&rsquo;s water in the pitcher, and some, cooler, to drink, in
that red jar hanging on the gallery.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the bell?&rdquo; asked McGuire, looking about.
&ldquo;Bell for what?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bell to ring for things. I can&rsquo;t&ndash;see here,&rdquo; he exploded in a sudden, weak fury, &ldquo;I never
asked you to bring me here. I never held you up for a cent. I never gave you a hard-luck story
till you asked me. Here I am fifty miles from a bellboy or a cocktail. I&rsquo;m sick. I can&rsquo;t hustle.
Gee! but I&rsquo;m up against it!&rdquo; McGuire fell upon the cot and sobbed shiveringly.
Raidler went to the door and called. A slender, bright-complexioned Mexican youth
about twenty came quickly. Raidler spoke to him in Spanish.
&ldquo;Ylario, it is in my mind that I promised you the position of vaquero on the San Carlos
range at the fall rodeo.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Si, senor, such was your goodness.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Listen. This senorito is my friend. He is very sick. Place yourself at his side. Attend to
his wants at all times. Have much patience and care with him. And when he is well, or&ndash;and
when he is well, instead of vaquero I will make you mayordomo of the Rancho de las Piedras.
Esta bueno?&ldquo;&ldquo;Si, si&ndash;mil gracias, senor.&rdquo; Ylario tried to kneel upon the floor in his gratitude, but the
cattleman kicked at him benevolently, growling, &ldquo;None of your opery-house antics, now.&rdquo;
Ten minutes later Ylario came from McGuire&rsquo;s room and stood before Raidler.
&ldquo;The little senor,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;presents his compliments&rdquo; (Raidler credited Ylario
with the preliminary) &ldquo;and desires some pounded ice, one hot bath, one gin feez-z, that the
windows be all closed, toast, one shave, one Newyorkheral&rsquo;, cigarettes, and to send one
telegram.&rdquo;
Raidler took a quart bottle of whisky from his medicine cabinet. &ldquo;Here, take him this,&rdquo;
he said.
Thus was instituted the reign of terror at the Solito Ranch. For a few weeks McGuire
blustered and boasted and swaggered before the cow- punchers who rode in for miles
around to see this latest importation of Raidler&rsquo;s. He was an absolutely new experience to
them. He explained to them all the intricate points of sparring and the tricks of training and
defence. He opened to their minds&rsquo; view all the indecorous life of a tagger after professional
sports. His jargon of slang was a continuous joy and surprise to them. His gestures, his
strange poses, his frank ribaldry of tongue and principle fascinated them. He was like a being
from a new world.
Strange to say, this new world he had entered did not exist to him. He was an utter
egoist of bricks and mortar. He had dropped out, he felt, into open space for a time, and all it
contained was an audience for his reminiscences. Neither the limitless freedom of the
prairie days nor the grand hush of the close-drawn, spangled nights touched him. All the
hues of Aurora could not win him from the pink pages of a sporting journal. &ldquo;Get something
for nothing,&rdquo; was his mission in life; &ldquo;Thirty-seventh&rdquo; Street was his goal.
Nearly two months after his arrival he began to complain that he felt worse. It was then
that he became the ranch&rsquo;s incubus, its harpy, its Old Man of the Sea. He shut himself in his
room like some venomous kobold or flibbertigibbet, whining, complaining, cursing, accusing.
The keynote of his plaint was that he had been inveigled into a gehenna against his will; that
he was dying of neglect and lack of comforts. With all his dire protestations of increasing
illness, to the eye of others he remained unchanged. His currant-like eyes were as bright and
diabolic as ever; his voice was as rasping; his callous face, with the skin drawn tense as a
drum-head, had no flesh to lose. A flush on his prominent cheek bones each afternoon
hinted that a clinical thermometer might have revealed a symptom, and percussion might
have established the fact that McGuire was breathing with only one lung, but his
appearance remained the same.
In constant attendance upon him was Ylario, whom the coming reward of the
mayordomoship must have greatly stimulated, for McGuire chained him to a bitter existence.
The air&ndash;the man&rsquo;s only chance for life&ndash;he commanded to be kept out by closed windowsand drawn curtains. The room was always blue and foul with cigarette smoke; whosoever
entered it must sit, suffocating, and listen to the imp&rsquo;s interminable gasconade concerning
his scandalous career.
The oddest thing of all was the relation existing between McGuire and his benefactor.
The attitude of the invalid toward the cattleman was something like that of a peevish,
perverse child toward an indulgent parent. When Raidler would leave the ranch McGuire
would fall into a fit of malevolent, silent sullenness. When he returned, he would be met by
a string of violent and stinging reproaches. Raidler&rsquo;s attitude toward his charge was quite
inexplicable in its way. The cattleman seemed actually to assume and feel the character
assigned to him by McGuire&rsquo;s intemperate accusations&ndash;the character of tyrant and guilty
oppressor. He seemed to have adopted the responsibility of the fellow&rsquo;s condition, and he
always met his tirades with a pacific, patient, and even remorseful kindness that never
altered.
One day Raidler said to him, &ldquo;Try more air, son. You can have the buckboard and a
driver every day if you&rsquo;ll go. Try a week or two in one of the cow camps. I&rsquo;ll fix you up plumb
comfortable. The ground, and the air next to it&ndash;them&rsquo;s the things to cure you. I knowed a
man from Philadelphy, sicker than you are, got lost on the Guadalupe, and slept on the bare
grass in sheep camps for two weeks. Well, sir, it started him getting well, which he done.
Close to the ground&ndash;that&rsquo;s where the medicine in the air stays. Try a little hossback riding
now. There&rsquo;s a gentle pony&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ve I done to yer?&rdquo; screamed McGuire. &ldquo;Did I ever doublecross yer? Did I ask you
to bring me here? Drive me out to your camps if you wanter; or stick a knife in me and save
trouble. Ride! I can&rsquo;t lift my feet. I couldn&rsquo;t sidestep a jab from a five-year-old kid. That&rsquo;s
what your d&ndash;d ranch has done for me. There&rsquo;s nothing to eat, nothing to see, and nobody to
talk to but a lot of Reubens who don&rsquo;t know a punching bag from a lobster salad.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lonesome place, for certain,&rdquo; apologised Raidler abashedly. &ldquo;We got plenty, but
it&rsquo;s rough enough. Anything you think of you want, the boys&rsquo;ll ride up and fetch it down for
you.&rdquo;
It was Chad Murchison, a cow-puncher from the Circle Bar outfit, who first suggested
that McGuire&rsquo;s illness was fraudulent. Chad had brought a basket of grapes for him thirty
miles, and four out of his way, tied to his saddle-horn. After remaining in the smoke-tainted
room for a while, he emerged and bluntly confided his suspicions to Raidler.
&ldquo;His arm,&rdquo; said Chad, &ldquo;is harder&rsquo;n a diamond. He interduced me to what he called a
shore-perplexus punch, and &lsquo;twas like being kicked twice by a mustang. He&rsquo;s playin&rsquo; it low
down on you, Curt. He ain&rsquo;t no sicker&rsquo;n I am. I hate to say it, but the runt&rsquo;s workin&rsquo; you for
range and shelter.&ldquo;The cattleman&rsquo;s ingenuous mind refused to entertain Chad&rsquo;s view of the case, and
when, later, he came to apply the test, doubt entered not into his motives.
One day, about noon, two men drove up to the ranch, alighted, hitched, and came in to
dinner; standing and general invitations being the custom of the country. One of them was a
great San Antonio doctor, whose costly services had been engaged by a wealthy cowman
who had been laid low by an accidental bullet. He was now being driven back to the station
to take the train back to town. After dinner Raidler took him aside, pushed a twenty-dollar
bill against his hand, and said:
&ldquo;Doc, there&rsquo;s a young chap in that room I guess has got a bad case of consumption. I&rsquo;d
like for you to look him over and see just how bad he is, and if we can do anything for him.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How much was that dinner I just ate, Mr. Raidler?&rdquo; said the doctor bluffly, looking over
his spectacles. Raidler returned the money to his pocket. The doctor immediately entered
McGuire&rsquo;s room, and the cattleman seated himself upon a heap of saddles on the gallery,
ready to reproach himself in the event the verdict should be unfavourable.
In ten minutes the doctor came briskly out. &ldquo;Your man,&rdquo; he said promptly, &ldquo;is as sound
as a new dollar. His lungs are better than mine. Respiration, temperature, and pulse normal.
Chest expansion four inches. Not a sign of weakness anywhere. Of course I didn&rsquo;t examine
for the bacillus, but it isn&rsquo;t there. You can put my name to the diagnosis. Even cigarettes and
a vilely close room haven&rsquo;t hurt him. Coughs, does he? Well, you tell him it isn&rsquo;t necessary.
You asked if there is anything we could do for him. Well, I advise you to set him digging
post-holes or breaking mustangs. There&rsquo;s our team ready. Good- day, sir.&rdquo; And like a puff of
wholesome, blustery wind the doctor was off.
Raidler reached out and plucked a leaf from a mesquite bush by the railing, and began
chewing it thoughtfully.
The branding season was at hand, and the next morning Ross Hargis, foreman of the
outfit, was mustering his force of some twenty-five men at the ranch, ready to start for the
San Carlos range, where the work was to begin. By six o&rsquo;clock the horses were all saddled,
the grub wagon ready, and the cow-punchers were swinging themselves upon their mounts,
when Raidler bade them wait. A boy was bringing up an extra pony, bridled and saddled, to
the gate. Raidler walked to McGuire&rsquo;s room and threw open the door. McGuire was lying on
his cot, not yet dressed, smoking.
&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; said the cattleman, and his voice was clear and brassy, like a bugle.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked McGuire, a little startled.
&ldquo;Get up and dress. I can stand a rattlesnake, but I hate a liar. Do I have to tell you
again?&rdquo; He caught McGuire by the neck and stood him on the floor.&ldquo;Say, friend,&rdquo; cried McGuire wildly, &ldquo;are you bug-house? I&rsquo;m sick&ndash; see? I&rsquo;ll croak if I got
to hustle. What&rsquo;ve I done to yer?&ldquo;&ndash;he began his chronic whine&ndash;&ldquo;I never asked yer to&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Put on your clothes,&rdquo; called Raidler in a rising tone.
Swearing, stumbling, shivering, keeping his amazed, shining eyes upon the now
menacing form of the aroused cattleman, McGuire managed to tumble into his clothes.
Then Raidler took him by the collar and shoved him out and across the yard to the extra
pony hitched at the gate. The cow-punchers lolled in their saddles, open-mouthed.
&ldquo;Take this man,&rdquo; said Raidler to Ross Hargis, &ldquo;and put him to work. Make him work hard,
sleep hard, and eat hard. You boys know I done what I could for him, and he was welcome.
Yesterday the best doctor in San Antone examined him, and says he&rsquo;s got the lungs of a
burro and the constitution of a steer. You know what to do with him, Ross.&rdquo;
Ross Hargis only smiled grimly.
&ldquo;Aw,&rdquo; said McGuire, looking intently at Raidler, with a peculiar expression upon his face,
&ldquo;the croaker said I was all right, did he? Said I was fakin&rsquo;, did he? You put him onto me. You
t&rsquo;ought I wasn&rsquo;t sick. You said I was a liar. Say, friend, I talked rough, I know, but I didn&rsquo;t mean
most of it. If you felt like I did&ndash;aw! I forgot&ndash;I ain&rsquo;t sick, the croaker says. Well, friend, now I&rsquo;ll
go work for yer. Here&rsquo;s where you play even.&rdquo;
He sprang into the saddle easily as a bird, got the quirt from the horn, and gave his
pony a slash with it. &ldquo;Cricket,&rdquo; who once brought in Good Boy by a neck at Hawthorne&ndash;and
a 10 to 1 shot&ndash;had his foot in the stirrups again.
McGuire led the cavalcade as they dashed away for San Carlos, and the cow-punchers
gave a yell of applause as they closed in behind his dust.
But in less than a mile he had lagged to the rear, and was last man when they struck the
patch of high chaparral below the horse pens. Behind a clump of this he drew rein, and held
a handkerchief to his mouth. He took it away drenched with bright, arterial blood, and threw
it carefully into a clump of prickly pear. Then he slashed with his quirt again, gasped &ldquo;G&rsquo;wan&rdquo;
to his astonished pony, and galloped after the gang.
That night Raidler received a message from his old home in Alabama. There had been a
death in the family; an estate was to divide, and they called for him to come. Daylight found
him in the buckboard, skimming the prairies for the station. It was two months before he
returned. When he arrived at the ranch house he found it well-nigh deserted save for Ylario,
who acted as a kind of steward during his absence. Little by little the youth made him
acquainted with the work done while he was away. The branding camp, he was informed,
was still doing business. On account of many severe storms the cattle had been badlyscattered, and the branding had been accomplished but slowly. The camp was now in the
valley of the Guadalupe, twenty miles away.
&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Raidler, suddenly remembering, &ldquo;that fellow I sent along with
them&ndash;McGuire&ndash;is he working yet?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Ylario. &ldquo;Mans from the camp come verree few times to the ranch.
So plentee work with the leetle calves. They no say. Oh, I think that fellow McGuire he dead
much time ago.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; said Raidler. &ldquo;What you talking about?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Verree sick fellow, McGuire,&rdquo; replied Ylario, with a shrug of his shoulder. &ldquo;I theenk he
no live one, two month when he go away.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; said Raidler. &ldquo;He humbugged you, too, did he? The doctor examined him and
said he was sound as a mesquite knot.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That doctor,&rdquo; said Ylario, smiling, &ldquo;he tell you so? That doctor no see McGuire.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Talk up,&rdquo; ordered Raidler. &ldquo;What the devil do you mean?&rdquo;
&ldquo;McGuire,&rdquo; continued the boy tranquilly, &ldquo;he getting drink water outside when that
doctor come in room. That doctor take me and pound me all over here with his
fingers&rdquo;&ndash;putting his hand to his chest&ndash;&ldquo;I not know for what. He put his ear here and here
and here, and listen&ndash; I not know for what. He put little glass stick in my mouth. He feel my
arm here. He make me count like whisper&ndash;so&ndash;twenty, treinta, cuarenta. Who knows,&rdquo;
concluded Ylario, with a deprecating spread of his hands, &ldquo;for what that doctor do those
verree droll and such-like things?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What horses are up?&rdquo; asked Raidler shortly.
&ldquo;Paisano is grazing out behind the little corral, senor.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Saddle him for me at once.&rdquo;
Within a very few minutes the cattleman was mounted and away. Paisano, well named
after that ungainly but swift-running bird, struck into his long lope that ate up the ground
like a strip of macaroni. In two hours and a quarter Raidler, from a gentle swell, saw the
branding camp by a water hole in the Guadalupe. Sick with expectancy of the news he
feared, he rode up, dismounted, and dropped Paisano&rsquo;s reins. So gentle was his heart that at
that moment he would have pleaded guilty to the murder of McGuire.The only being in the camp was the cook, who was just arranging the hunks of
barbecued beef, and distributing the tin coffee cups for supper. Raidler evaded a direct
question concerning the one subject in his mind.
&ldquo;Everything all right in camp, Pete?&rdquo; he managed to inquire.
&ldquo;So, so,&rdquo; said Pete, conservatively. &ldquo;Grub give out twice. Wind scattered the cattle, and
we&rsquo;ve had to rake the brush for forty mile. I need a new coffee-pot. And the mosquitos is
some more hellish than common.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The boys&ndash;all well?&rdquo;
Pete was no optimist. Besides, inquiries concerning the health of cow- punchers were
not only superfluous, but bordered on flaccidity. It was not like the boss to make them.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s left of &lsquo;em don&rsquo;t miss no calls to grub,&rdquo; the cook conceded.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s left of &lsquo;em?&rdquo; repeated Raidler in a husky voice. Mechanically he began to look
around for McGuire&rsquo;s grave. He had in his mind a white slab such as he had seen in the
Alabama church-yard. But immediately he knew that was foolish.
&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s left. Cow camps change in two months. Some&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
Raidler nerved himself.
&ldquo;That&ndash;chap&ndash;I sent along&ndash;McGuire&ndash;did&ndash;he&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; interrupted Pete, rising with a chunk of corn bread in each hand, &ldquo;that was a
dirty shame, sending that poor, sick kid to a cow camp. A doctor that couldn&rsquo;t tell he was
graveyard meat ought to be skinned with a cinch buckle. Game as he was, too&ndash;it&rsquo;s a scandal
among snakes&ndash;lemme tell you what he done. First night in camp the boys started to initiate
him in the leather breeches degree. Ross Hargis busted him one swipe with his chaparreras,
and what do you reckon the poor child did? Got up, the little skeeter, and licked Ross. Licked
Ross Hargis. Licked him good. Hit him plenty and everywhere and hard. Ross&rsquo;d just get up
and pick out a fresh place to lay down on agin.
&ldquo;Then that McGuire goes off there and lays down with his head in the grass and bleeds.
A hem&rsquo;ridge they calls it. He lays there eighteen hours by the watch, and they can&rsquo;t budge
him. Then Ross Hargis, who loves any man who can lick him, goes to work and damns the
doctors from Greenland to Poland Chiny; and him and Green Branch Johnson they gets
McGuire into a tent, and spells each other feedin&rsquo; him chopped raw meat and whisky.
&ldquo;But it looks like the kid ain&rsquo;t got no appetite to git well, for they misses him from the
tent in the night and finds him rootin&rsquo; in the grass, and likewise a drizzle fallin&rsquo;. &lsquo;G&rsquo;wan,&rsquo; hesays, &lsquo;lemme go and die like I wanter. He said I was a liar and a fake and I was playin&rsquo; sick.
Lemme alone.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Two weeks,&rdquo; went on the cook, &ldquo;he laid around, not noticin&rsquo; nobody, and then&ndash;&rdquo;
A sudden thunder filled the air, and a score of galloping centaurs crashed through the
brush into camp.
&ldquo;Illustrious rattlesnakes!&rdquo; exclaimed Pete, springing all ways at once; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the boys
come, and I&rsquo;m an assassinated man if supper ain&rsquo;t ready in three minutes.&rdquo;
But Raidler saw only one thing. A little, brown-faced, grinning chap, springing from his
saddle in the full light of the fire. McGuire was not like that, and yet&ndash;
In another instant the cattleman was holding him by the hand and shoulder.
&ldquo;Son, son, how goes it?&rdquo; was all he found to say.
&ldquo;Close to the ground, says you,&rdquo; shouted McGuire, crunching Raidler&rsquo;s fingers in a grip
of steel; &ldquo;and dat&rsquo;s where I found it&ndash;healt&rsquo; and strengt&rsquo;, and tumbled to what a cheap skate I
been actin&rsquo;. T&rsquo;anks fer kickin&rsquo; me out, old man. And&ndash;say! de joke&rsquo;s on dat croaker, ain&rsquo;t it? I
looked t&rsquo;rough the window and see him playin&rsquo; tag on dat Dago kid&rsquo;s solar plexus.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You son of a tinker,&rdquo; growled the cattleman, &ldquo;whyn&rsquo;t you talk up and say the doctor
never examined you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah&ndash;g&rsquo;wan!&rdquo; said McGuire, with a flash of his old asperity, &ldquo;nobody can&rsquo;t bluff me. You
never ast me. You made your spiel, and you t&rsquo;rowed me out, and I let it go at dat. And, say,
friend, dis chasin&rsquo; cows is outer sight. Dis is de whitest bunch of sports I ever travelled with.
You&rsquo;ll let me stay, won&rsquo;t yer, old man?&rdquo;
Raidler looked wonderingly toward Ross Hargis.
&ldquo;That cussed little runt,&rdquo; remarked Ross tenderly, &ldquo;is the Jo-dartin&rsquo;est hustler&ndash;and the
hardest hitter in anybody&rsquo;s cow camp.&rdquo;
The Hypotheses of Failure （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>LAWYER GOOCH bestowed his undivided attention upon the engrossing arts of his
profession. But one flight of fancy did he allow his mind to entertain. He was fond of likeninghis suite of office rooms to the bot- tom of a ship. The rooms were three in number, with a
door opening from one to another. These doors could also be closed.
&ldquo;Ships,&rdquo; Lawyer Gooch would say, &ldquo;are constructed for safety, with separate, water-tight
compartments in their bottoms. If one compartment springs a leak it fills with water; but the
good ship goes on unhurt. Were it not for the separating bulkheads one leak would sink the
vessel. Now it often happens that while I am occu- pied with clients, other clients with
conflicting interests call. With the assistance of Archibald &ndash; an office boy with a future &ndash; I
cause the dangerous influx to be diverted into separate compartments, while I sound with
my legal plummet the depth of each. If neces- sary, they may be haled into the hallway and
permitted to escape by way of the stairs, which we may term the lee scuppers. Thus the
good ship of business is kept afloat; whereas if the element that supports her were allowed
to mingle freely in her hold we might be swamped &ndash; ha, ha, ha!
The law is dry. Good jokes are few. Surely it might be permitted Lawyer Gooch to
mitigate the bore of briefs, the tedium of torts and the prosiness of processes with even so
light a levy upon the good property of humour.
Lawyer Gooch&rsquo;s practice leaned largely to the settle- ment of marital infelicities. Did
matrimony languish through complications, he mediated, soothed and arbi- trated. Did it
suffer from implications, he readjusted, defended and championed. Did it arrive at the
extremity of duplications, he always got light sentences for his clients.
But not always was Lawyer Gooch the keen, armed, wily belligerent, ready with his
two-edged sword to lop off the shackles of Hymen. He had been known to build up instead
of demolishing, to reunite instead of severing, to lead erring and foolish ones back into the
fold instead of scattering the flock. Often had he by his eloquent and moving appeals sent
husband and wife, weeping, back into each other&rsquo;s arms. Frequently he had coached
childhood so successfully that, at the psychological moment (and at a given signal) the
plaintive pipe of &ldquo;Papa, won&rsquo;t you turn home adain to me and muvver?&rdquo; had won the day
and upheld the pillars of a tottering home.
Unprejudiced persons admitted that Lawyer Gooch received as big fees from these
revoked clients as would have been paid him had the cases been contested in court.
Prejudiced ones intimated that his fees were doubled. because the penitent couples always
came back later for the divorce, anyhow.
There came a season in June when the legal ship of Lawyer Gooch (to borrow his own
figure) was nearly becalmed. The divorce mill grinds slowly in June. It is the month of Cupid
and Hymen.
Lawyer Gooch, then, sat idle in the middle room of his clientless suite. A small
anteroom connected &ndash; or rather separated &ndash; this apartment from the hallway. Here wasstationed Archibald, who wrested from visitors their cards or oral nomenclature which he
bore to his master while they waited.
Suddenly, on this day, there came a great knocking at the outermost door.
Archibald, opening it, was thrust aside as superfluous by the visitor, who without due
reverence at once pene- trated to the office of Lawyer Gooch and threw himself with
good-natured insolence into a comfortable chair facing that gentlemen.
&ldquo;You are Phineas C. Gooch, attorney-at-law?&rdquo; said the visitor, his tone of voice and
inflection making his words at once a question, an assertion and an accusation.
Before committing himself by a reply, the lawyer esti- mated his possible client in one
of his brief but shrewd and calculating glances.
The man was of the emphatic type &ndash; large-sized, active, bold and debonair in
demeanour, vain beyond a doubt, slightly swaggering, ready and at ease. He was wellclothed, but with a shade too much ornateness. He was seeking a lawyer; but if that fact
would seem to saddle him with troubles they were not patent in his beaming eye and
courageous air.
&ldquo;My name is Gooch,&rdquo; at length the lawyer admitted. Upon pressure he would also have
confessed to the Phineas C. But he did not consider it good practice to volunteer information.
&ldquo;I did not receive your card,&rdquo; he continued, by way of rebuke, &ldquo;so I &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;I know you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; remarked the visitor, coolly; &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t just yet. Light up?&rdquo; He
threw a leg over an arm of his chair, and tossed a handful of rich- hued cigars upon the table.
Lawyer Gooch knew the brand. He thawed just enough to accept the invitation to smoke.
&ldquo;You are a divorce lawyer,&rdquo; said the cardless visitor. This time there was no
interrogation in his voice. Nor did his words constitute a simple assertion. They formed a
charge &ndash; a denunciation &ndash; as one would say to a dog: &ldquo;You are a dog.&rdquo; Lawyer Gooch was
silent under the imputation.
&ldquo;You handle,&rdquo; continued the visitor, &ldquo;all the various ramifications of busted-up
connubiality. You are a surgeon, we might saw, who extracts Cupid&rsquo;s darts when he shoots
&lsquo;em into the wrong parties. You furnish patent, incandescent lights for premises where the
torch of Hymen has burned so low you can&rsquo;t light a cigar at it. Am I right, Mr. Gooch?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have undertaken cases,&rdquo; said the lawyer, guardedly, &ldquo;in the line to which your
figurative speech seems to refer. Do you wish to consult me professionally, Mr. &ndash; &ldquo; The
lawyer paused, with significance.&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said the other, with an arch wave of his cigar, &ldquo;not just yet. Let us approach
the subject with the caution that should have been used in the original act that makes this
pow-wow necessary. There exists a matrimonial jumble to be straightened out. But before I
give you names I want your honest &ndash; well, anyhow, your professional opinion on the merits
of the mix-up. I want you to size up the catastrophe &ndash; abstractly &ndash; you understand? I&rsquo;m Mr.
Nobody; and I&rsquo;ve got a story to tell you. Then you say what&rsquo;s what. Do you get my wireless?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You want to state a hypothetical case?&rdquo; suggested Lawyer Gooch.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the word I was after. &lsquo;Apothecary&rsquo; was the best shot I could make at it in my
mind. The hypo- thetical goes. I&rsquo;ll state the case. Suppose there&rsquo;s a woman &ndash; a deuced
fine-looking woman &ndash; who has run away from her husband and home? She&rsquo;s badly mashed
on another man who went to her town to work up some real estate business. Now, we may
as well call this woman&rsquo;s husband Thomas R. Billings, for that&rsquo;s his name. I&rsquo;m giving you
straight tips on the cognomens. The Lothario chap is Henry K. Jessup. The Billingses lived in a
little town called Susanville &ndash; a good many miles from here. Now, Jessup leaves Susanville
two weeks ago. The next day Mrs. Billings follows him. She&rsquo;s dead gone on this man Jessup;
you can bet your law library on that.&rdquo;
Lawyer Gooch&rsquo;s client said this with such unctuous satisfaction that even the callous
lawyer experienced a slight ripple of repulsion. He now saw clearly in his fatuous visitor the
conceit of the lady-killer, the egoistic complacency of the successful trifler.
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued the visitor, &ldquo;suppose this Mrs. Billings wasn&rsquo;t happy at home? We&rsquo;ll
say she and her husband didn&rsquo;t gee worth a cent. They&rsquo;ve got incom- patibility to burn. The
things she likes, Billings wouldn&rsquo;t have as a gift with trading-stamps. It&rsquo;s Tabby and Rover
with them all the time. She&rsquo;s an educated woman in science and culture, and she reads
things out loud at meetings. Billings is not on. He don&rsquo;t appreciate pro- gress and obelisks
and ethics, and things of that sort. Old Billings is simply a blink when it comes to such things.
The lady is out and out above his class. Now, lawyer, don&rsquo;t it look like a fair equalization of
rights and wrongs that a woman like that should be allowed to throw down Billings and take
the man that can appreciate her?
&ldquo;Incompatibility,&rdquo; said Lawyer Gooch, &ldquo;is undoubt- edly the source of much marital
discord and unhappiness. Where it is positively proved, divorce would seem to be the
equitable remedy. Are you &ndash; excuse me &ndash; is this man Jessup one to whom the lady may
safely trust her future?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, you can bet on Jessup,&rdquo; said the client, with a confident wag of his head. &ldquo;Jessup&rsquo;s
all right. He&rsquo;ll do the square thing. Why, he left Susanville just to keep pwple from talking
about Mrs. Billings. But she fol- lowed him up, and now, of course, he&rsquo;ll stick to her. When
she gets a divorce, all legal and proper, Jessup the proper thing.&ldquo;&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Lawyer Gooch, &ldquo;continuing the hypo- if you prefer, and supposing that
my services should ired in the case, what &ndash; &ldquo;
The client rose impulsively to his feet.
&ldquo;Oh, dang the hypothetical business,&rdquo; he exclaimed, impatiently. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s let her drop,
and get down to straight talk. You ought to know who I am by this time. I want that woman
to have her divorce. I&rsquo;ll pay for it. The day you set Mrs. Billings free I&rsquo;ll pay you five hundred
dollars.&rdquo;
Lawyer Gooch&rsquo;s client banged his fist upon the table to punctuate his generosity.
&ldquo;If that is the case &ndash; &rdquo; began the lawyer.
&ldquo;Lady to see you, sir,&rdquo; bawled Archibald, bouncing in from his anteroom. He had orders
to always announce immediately any client that might come. There was no sense in turning
business away.
Lawyer Gooch took client number one by the arm and led him suavely into one of the
adjoining rooms. &ldquo;Favour me by remaining here a few minutes, sir,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I will return
and resume our consultation with the least possible delay. I am rather expecting a visit from
a very wealthy old lady in connection with a will. I will not keep you waiting long.&rdquo;
The breezy gentleman seated himself with obliging acquiescence, aud took up a
magazine. The lawyer returned to the middle office, carefully closing behind him the
connecting door.
&ldquo;Show the lady in, Archibald,&rdquo; he said to the office boy, who was awaiting the order.
A tall lady, of commanding presence and sternly hand- some, entered the room. She
wore robes &ndash; robes; not clothes &ndash; ample and fluent. In her eye could be per- ceived the
lambent flame of genius and soul. In her hand was a green bag of the capacity of a bushel,
and an umbrella that also seemed to wear a robe, ample and fluent. She accepted a chair.
&ldquo;Are you Mr. Phineas C. Gooch, the lawyer?&rdquo; she asked, in formal and unconciliatory
tones.
&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; answered Lawyer Gooch, without circum- locution. He never circumlocuted
when dealing with a woman. Women circumlocute. Time is wasted when both sides in
debate employ the same tactics.
&ldquo;As a lawyer, sir,&rdquo; began the lady, &ldquo;you may have acquired some knowledge of the
human heart. Do you believe that the pusillanimous and petty conventions of our artificial
social life should stand as an obstacle in the way of a noble and affectionate heart when itfinds its true mate among the miserable and worthless wretches in the world that are called
men?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Lawyer Gooch, in the tone that he used in curbing his female clients,
&ldquo;this is an office for conducting the practice of law. I am a lawyer, not a philosopher, nor the
editor of an &lsquo;Answers to the Lovelorn&rsquo; column of a newspaper. I have other clients waiting. I
will ask you kindly to come to the point.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t get so stiff around the gills about it,&rdquo; said the lady, with a snap of
her luminous eves and a startling gyration of her umbrella. &ldquo;Business is what I&rsquo;ve come for. I
want your opinion in the matter of a suit for divorce, as the vulgar would call it, but which is
really only the readjustment of the false and ignoble con- ditions that the short-sihhted laws
of man have interposed between a loving &ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I beg your pardon, madam,&rdquo; interrupted Lawyer Gooch, with some impatience, &ldquo;for
reminding you again that this is a law office. Perhaps Mrs. Wilcox &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Mrs. Wilcox is all right,&rdquo; cut in the lady, with a hint of asperity. &ldquo;And so are Tolstoi, and
Mrs. Gertrude Atherton, and Omar Khayyam, and Mr. Edward Bok. I&rsquo;ve read &lsquo;em all. I would
like to discuss with you the divine right of the soul as opposed to the freedom-destroy- ing
restrictions of a bigoted and narrow-minded society. But I will proceed to business. I would
prefer to lay the matter before you in an impersonal way until vou pass upon its merits. That
is to describe it as a sup- posable instance, without &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;You wish to state a hypothetical case?&rdquo; said Lawyer Gooch.
&ldquo;I was going to say that,&rdquo; said the lady, sharply. &ldquo;Now, suppose there is a woman who is
all soul and heart and aspirations for a complete existence. This woman has a husband who
is far below her in intellect, in taste &ndash; in everything. Bah! he is a brute. He despises literature.
He sneers at the lofty thoughts of the world&rsquo;s great thinkers. He thinks only of real estate
and such sordid things. He is no mate for a woman with soul. We will say that this
unfortunate wife one day meets with her ideal -a man with brain and heart and force. She
loves him. Although this man feels the thrill of a new-found affinity he is too noble, too
honourable to declare himself. He flies from the presence of his beloved. She flies after him,
trampling, with superb indifference, upon the fetters with which an unenlightened social
system would bind her. Now, what will a divorce cost? Eliza Ann Timmins, the poetess of
Sycamore Gap, got one for three hundred and forty dollars. Can I &ndash; I mean can this lady I
speak of get one that cheap?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Lawyer Gooch, &ldquo;your last two or three sentences delight me with their
intelligence and clearness. Can we not now abandon the hypothetical and come down to
names and business?&ldquo;&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; exclaimed the lady, adopting the practical with admirable readiness.
&ldquo;Thomas R. Bil- lings is the name of the low brute who stands between the happiness of his
legal &ndash; his legal, but not his spiri- tual &ndash; wife and Henry K. Jessup, the noble man whom
nature intended for her mate. I,&rdquo; concluded the client, with an air of dramatic revelation,
&ldquo;am Mrs. Billings!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Gentlemen to see you, sir,&rdquo; shouted Archibald, invad- ing the room almost at a
handspring. Lawyer Gooch arose from his chair.
&ldquo;Mrs. Billings,&rdquo; he said courteously, &ldquo;allow me to conduct you into the adjoining office
apartment for a few minutes. I am expecting a very wealthy old gentleman on busines
connected with a will. In a very short while I will join you, and continue our consultation.&rdquo;
With his accustomed chivalrous manner, Lawyer Gooch ushered his soulful client into
the remaining unoccupied room, and came out, closing the door with circumspection.
The next visitor introduced by Archibald was a thin, nervous, irritable-looking man of
middle age, with a worried and apprehensive expression of countenance. He carried in one
hand a small satchel, which he set down upon the floor beside the chair which the lawyer
placed for him. His clothing was of good quality, but it was worn without regard to neatness
or style, and appeared to be covered with the dust of travel.
&ldquo;You make a specialty of divorce cases,&rdquo; he said, in, an agitated but business-like tone.
&ldquo;I may say,&rdquo; began Lawyer Gooch, &ldquo;that my prac- tice has not altogether avoided &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;I know you do,&rdquo; interrupted client number three. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell me. I&rsquo;ve heard all
about you. I have a case to lay before you without necessarily disclosing any connection that
I might have with it &ndash; that is &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;You wish,&rdquo; said Lawyer Gooch, &ldquo;to state a hvpo- thetical case.
&ldquo;You may call it that. I am a plain man of business. I will be as brief as possible. We will
first take up hypothetical woman. We will say she is married uncon- genially. In many ways
she is a superior woman. Phys- ically she is considered to be handsome. She is devoted to
what she calls literature &ndash; poetry and prose, and such stuff. Her husband is a plain man in
the business walks of life. Their home has not been happy, although the husband has tried
to make it so. Some time ago a man &ndash; a stranger &ndash; came to the peaceful town in which they
lived and engaged in some real estate operations. This woman met him, and became
unaccountably infatu- ated with him. Her attentions became so open that the man felt the
community to be no safe place for him, so he left it. She abandoned husband and home, and
followed him. She forsook- her home, where she was provided with every comfort, to follow
this man who had inspired her with such a strange affection. Is there any- thing more to bedeplored,&rdquo; concluded the client, in a trembling voice, &ldquo;than the wrecking of a home by a
woman&rsquo;s uncalculating folly?&rdquo;
Lawyer Gooch delivered the cautious opinion that there was not.
&ldquo;This man she has gone to join,&rdquo; resumed the visitor, &ldquo;is not the man to make her happy.
It is a wild and foolish self-deception that makes her think he will. Her husband, in spite of
their many disagreements, is the only one capable of dealing with her sensitive and peculiar
nature. But this she does not realize now.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Would you consider a divorce the logical cure in the case you present?&rdquo; asked Lawyer
Gooch, who felt that the conversation was wandering too far from the field of business.
&ldquo;A divorce!&rdquo; exclaimed the client, feelingly - almost tearfully. &ldquo;No, no-not that. I have
read, Mr. Gooch, of many instances where your sympathy and kindly inter- est led you to act
as a mediator between estranged hus- band and wife, and brought them together again. Let
us drop the hypothetical case &ndash; I need conceal no longer that it is I who am the sufferer in
this sad affair &ndash; the names you shall have &ndash; Thomas R. Billings and wife &ndash; and Henry K.
Jessup, the man with whom she is infatuated.&rdquo;
Client number three laid his hand upon Mr. Gooch&rsquo;s arm. Deep emotion was written
upon his careworn face. &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake&rdquo;, he said fervently, &ldquo;help me in this hour of
trouble. Seek, out Mrs. Billings, and persuade her to abandon this distressing pursuit of her
lamentable folly. Tell her, Mr. Gooch, that her husband is willing to receive her back to his
heart and home &ndash; promise her anything that will induce her to return. I have heard of your
success in these matters. Mrs. Bil- lings cannot be very far away. I am worn out with travel
and weariness. Twice during the pursuit I saw her, but various circumstances prevented our
having an inter- view. Will you undertake this mission for me, Mr. Gooch, and earn my
everlasting gratitude?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Lawver Gooch, frowning slightly at the other&rsquo;s last words, but
immediately calling up an expression of virtuous benevolence, &ldquo;that on a number of
occasions I have been successful in persuading couples who sought the severing of their
matrimonial bonds to think better of their rash intentions and return to their homes
reconciled. But I assure you that the work is often exceedingly difficult. The amount of
argument, perseverance, and, if I may be allowed to say it, eloquence that it requires would
astonish you. But this is a case in which my sympathies would be wholly enlisted. I feel
deeply for you sir, and I would be most happy to see husband and wife reunited. But my
time,&rdquo; concluded the lawyer, looking at his watch as if suddenly reminded of the fact, &ldquo;is
valuable.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am aware of that,&rdquo; said the client, &ldquo;and if you will take the case and persuade Mrs.
Billings to return home and leave the man alone that she is following &ndash; on that day I will payyou the sum of one thousand dollars. I have made a little money in real estate during the
recent boom in Susanville, and I will not begrudge that amount.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Retain your seat for a few moments, please,&rdquo; said Lawyer Gooch, arising, and again
consulting his watch. &ldquo;I have another client waiting in an adjoining room whom I had very
nearly forgotten. I will return in the briefest possible space.&rdquo;
The situation was now one that fully satisfied Lawyer Gooch&rsquo;s love of intricacy and
complication. He revelled in cases that presented such subtle problems and possi- bilities. It
pleased him to think that he was master of the happiness and fate of the three individuals
who sat, uncon- cious of one another&rsquo;s presence, within his reach. His old figure of the ship
glided into his mind. But now the figure failed, for to have filled every compartment of an
actual vessel would have been to endanger her safety; with his compartments full, his ship
of affairs could but sail on to the advantageous port of a fine, fat fee. The thing for him to do,
of course, was to wring the best bargain he could from some one of his anxious cargo.
First he called to the office boy: &ldquo;Lock the outer door, Archibald, and admit no one.&rdquo;
Then he moved, with long, silent strides into the room in which client number one waited.
That gentleman sat, patiently scanning the pictures in the magazine, with a cigar in his
mouth and his feet upon a table.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he remarked, cheerfully, as the lawyer entered, &ldquo;have you made up your mind?
Does five hundred dollars go for getting the fair lady a divorce?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You mean that as a retainer?&rdquo; asked Lawyer Gooch, softly interrogative.
&ldquo;Hey? No; for the whole job. It&rsquo;s enough, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;My fee,&rdquo; said Lawyer Gooch, &ldquo;would be one thousand five hundred dollars. Five
hundred dollars down, and the remainder upon issuance of the divorce.&rdquo;
A loud whistle came from client number one. His feet descended to the floor.
&ldquo;Guess we can&rsquo;t close the deal,&rdquo; he said, arising, &ldquo;I cleaned up five hunderd dollars in a
little real estate dicker down in Susanville. I&rsquo;d do anything I could to free the lady, but it
out-sizes my pile.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Could you stand one thousand two hundred dollars?&rdquo; asked the lawyer, insinuatingly.
&ldquo;Five hundred is my limit, I tell you. Guess I&rsquo;ll have to hunt up a cheaper lawyer.&rdquo; The
client put on his hat.
&ldquo;Out this way, please,&rdquo; said Lawyer Gooch, opening the door that led into the hallway.As the gentleman flowed out of the compartment and down the stairs, Lawyer Gooch
smiled to himself. &ldquo;Exit Mr. Jessup,&rdquo; he murmured, as he fingered the Henry Clay tuft of hair
at his ear. &ldquo;And now for the forsaken husband.&rdquo; He returned to the middle office, and
assumed a businesslike manner.
&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said to client number three, &ldquo;that you agree to pay one thousand
dollars if I bring about, or am instrumental in bringing about, the return of Mrs. Billings to
her home, and her abandonment of her infatu- ated pursuit of the man for whom she has
conceived such a violent fancy. Also that the case is now unreservedly in my hands on that
basis. Is that correct?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Entirely&rdquo;, said the other, eagerly. And I can produce the cash any time at two hours&rsquo;
notice.&rdquo;
Lawyer Gooch stood up at his full height. His thin figure seemed to expand. His thumbs
sought the arm- holes of his vest. Upon his face was a look of sym- pathetic benignity that he
always wore during such undertakings.
&ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; he said, in kindly tones, &ldquo;I think I can promise you an early relief from your
troubles. I have that much confidence in my powers of argument and persuasion, in the
natural impulses of the human heart toward good, and in the strong influence of a
husband&rsquo;s unfaltering love. Mrs. Billinos, sir, is here &ndash; in that room &ndash; the lawyer&rsquo;s long arm
pointed to the door. &ldquo;I will call her in at once; and our united pleadings &ndash; &ldquo;
Lawyer Gooch paused, for client number three had leaped from his chair as if propelled
by steel springs, and clutched his satchel.
&ldquo;What the devil,&rdquo; he exclaimed, harshly, &ldquo;do vou mean? That woman in there! I thought
I shook her off forty miles back.&rdquo;
He ran to the open window, looked out below, and threw one leg over the sill.
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Lawyer Gooch, in amazement. &ldquo;What would you do? Come, Mr. Billings,
and face your erring but innocent wife. Our combined entreaties cannot fail to &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Billings!&rdquo; shouted the now thoroughly moved client. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Billings you, you old idiot!&rdquo;
Turning, he hurled his satchel with fury at the lawyer&rsquo;s head. It struck that astounded
peacemaker between the eyes, causing him to stagger backward a pace or two. When
Lawyer Gooch recovered his wits he saw that his client had disappeared. Rushing to the
window, he leaned out, and saw the recreant gathering himself up from the top of a shed
upon which he had dropped from the second-story window. Without stopping to collect his
hat he then plunged downward the remaining ten feet to the alley, up which he flew with
prodigious celerity until the surrounding building swallowed him up from view.Lawyer Gooch passed his hand tremblingly across his brow. It was a habitual act with
him, serving to clear his thoughts. Perhaps also it now seemed to soothe the spot where a
very hard alligator-hide satchel had struck.
The satchel lay upon the floor, wide open, with its con- tents spilled about.
Mechanically, Lawyer Gooch stooped to gather up the articles. The first was a collar; and the
omniscient eye of the man of law perceived, wonder- ingly, the initials H.K.J. marked upon it.
Then came a comb, a brush, a folded map, and a piece of soap. lastly, a handful of old
business letters, addressed &ndash; every one of them &ndash; to &ldquo;Henry K. Jessup, Esq.&rdquo;
Lawyer Gooch closed the satchel, and set it upon the table. He hesitated for a moment,
and then put on his hat and walked into the office boy&rsquo;s anteroom.
&ldquo;Archibald,&rdquo; he said mildly, as he opened the hall door, &ldquo;I am going around to the
Supreme Court rooms. In five minutes you may step into the inner office, and inform the
lady who is waiting there that&rdquo; &ndash; here Lawyer Gooch made use of the vernacular &ndash; &ldquo;that
there&rsquo;s nothing doing.&rdquo;
The Indian Summer of Dry Valley Johnson （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Dry Valley Johnson shook the bottle. You have to shake the bottle before using; for
sulphur will not dissolve. Then Dry Valley saturated a small sponge with the liquid and
rubbed it carefully into the roots of his hair. Besides sulphur there was sugar of lead in it and
tincture of nux vomica and bay rum. Dry Valley found the recipe in a Sunday newspaper. You
must next be told why a strong man came to fall a victim to a Beauty Hint.
Dry Valley had been a sheepman. His real name was Hector, but he had been
rechristened after his range to distinguish him from &ldquo;Elm Creek&rdquo; Johnson, who ran sheep
further down the Frio.
Many years of living face to face with sheep on their own terms wearied Dry Valley
Johnson. So, he sold his ranch for eighteen thousand dollars and moved to Santa Rosa to live
a life of gentlemanly ease. Being a silent and melancholy person of thirty-five&ndash;or perhaps
thirty-eight&ndash;he soon became that cursed and earth-cumbering thing&ndash;an elderlyish bachelor
with a hobby. Some one gave him his first strawberry to eat, and he was done for.
Dry Valley bought a four-room cottage in the village, and a library on strawberry culture.
Behind the cottage was a garden of which he made a strawberry patch. In his old greywoolen shirt, his brown duck trousers, and high-heeled boots he sprawled all day on a
canvas cot under a live-oak tree at his back door studying the history of the seductive,
scarlet berry.
The school teacher, Miss De Witt, spoke of him as &ldquo;a fine, presentable man, for all his
middle age.&rdquo; But, the focus of Dry Valley&rsquo;s eyes embraced no women. They were merely
beings who flew skirts as a signal for him to lift awkwardly his heavy, round-crowned,
broad-brimmed felt Stetson whenever he met them, and then hurry past to get back to his
beloved berries.
And all this recitative by the chorus is only to bring us to the point where you may be
told why Dry Valley shook up the insoluble sulphur in the bottle. So long-drawn and
inconsequential a thing is history&ndash;the anamorphous shadow of a milestone reaching down
the road between us and the setting sun.
When his strawberries were beginning to ripen Dry Valley bought the heaviest buggy
whip in the Santa Rosa store. He sat for many hours under the live oak tree plaiting and
weaving in an extension to its lash. When it was done he could snip a leaf from a bush
twenty feet away with the cracker. For the bright, predatory eyes of Santa Rosa youth were
watching the ripening berries, and Dry Valley was arming himself against their expected
raids. No greater care had he taken of his tender lambs during his ranching days than he did
of his cherished fruit, warding it from the hungry wolves that whistled and howled and shot
their marbles and peered through the fence that surrounded his property.
In the house next to Dry Valley&rsquo;s lived a widow with a pack of children that gave the
husbandman frequent anxious misgivings. In the woman there was a strain of the Spanish.
She had wedded one of the name of O&rsquo;Brien. Dry Valley was a connoisseur in cross strains;
and he foresaw trouble in the offspring of this union.
Between the two homesteads ran a crazy picket fence overgrown with morning glory
and wild gourd vines. Often he could see little heads with mops of black hair and flashing
dark eyes dodging in and out between the pickets, keeping tabs on the reddening berries.
Late one afternoon Dry Valley went to the post office. When he came back, like Mother
Hubbard he found the deuce to pay. The descendants of Iberian bandits and Hibernian cattle
raiders had swooped down upon his strawberry patch. To the outraged vision of Dry Valley
there seemed to be a sheep corral full of them; perhaps they numbered five or six. Between
the rows of green plants they were stooped, hopping about like toads, gobbling silently and
voraciously his finest fruit.
Dry Valley slipped into the house, got his whip, and charged the marauders. The lash
curled about the legs of the nearest&ndash;a greedy ten-year-old&ndash;before they knew they were
discovered. His screech gave warning; and the flock scampered for the fence like a drove ofjavelis flushed in the chaparral. Dry Valley&rsquo;s whip drew a toll of two more elfin shrieks before
they dived through the vine-clad fence and disappeared.
Dry Valley, less fleet, followed them nearly to the pickets. Checking his useless pursuit,
he rounded a bush, dropped his whip and stood, voiceless, motionless, the capacity of his
powers consumed by the act of breathing and preserving the perpendicular.
Behind the bush stood Panchita O&rsquo;Brien, scorning to fly. She was nineteen, the oldest of
the raiders. Her night-black hair was gathered back in a wild mass and tied with a scarlet
ribbon. She stood, with reluctant feet, yet nearer the brook than to the river; for childhood
had environed and detained her.
She looked at Dry Valley Johnson for a moment with magnificent insolence, and before
his eyes slowly crunched a luscious berry between her white teeth. Then she turned and
walked slowly to the fence with a swaying, conscious motion, such as a duchess might make
use of in leading a promenade. There she turned again and grilled Dry Valley Johnson once
more in the dark flame of her audacious eyes, laughed a trifle school-girlishly, and twisted
herself with pantherish quickness between the pickets to the O&rsquo;Brien side of the wild gourd
vine.
Dry Valley picked up his whip and went into his house. He stumbled as he went up the
two wooden steps. The old Mexican woman who cooked his meals and swept his house
called him to supper as he went through the rooms. Dry Valley went on, stumbled down the
front steps, out the gate and down the road into a mesquite thicket at the edge of town. He
sat down in the grass and laboriously plucked the spines from a prickly pear, one by one.
This was his attitude of thought, acquired in the days when his problems were only those of
wind and wool and water.
A thing had happened to the man&ndash;a thing that, if you are eligible, you must pray may
pass you by. He had become enveloped in the Indian Summer of the Soul.
Dry Valley had had no youth. Even his childhood had been one of dignity and
seriousness. At six he had viewed the frivolous gambols of the lambs on his father&rsquo;s ranch
with silent disapproval. His life as a young man had been wasted. The divine fires and
impulses, the glorious exaltations and despairs, the glow and enchantment of youth had
passed above his head. Never a thrill of Romeo had he known; he was but a melancholy
Jaques of the forest with a ruder philosophy, lacking the bitter-sweet flavour of experience
that tempered the veteran years of the rugged ranger of Arden. And now in his sere and
yellow leaf one scornful look from the eyes of Panchita O&rsquo;Brien had flooded the autumnal
landscape with a tardy and delusive summer heat.
But a sheepman is a hardy animal. Dry Valley Johnson had weathered too many
northers to turn his back on a late summer, spiritual or real. Old? He would show them.By the next mail went an order to San Antonio for an outfit of the latest clothes, colours
and styles and prices no object. The next day went the recipe for the hair restorer clipped
from a newspaper; for Dry Valley&rsquo;s sunburned auburn hair was beginning to turn silvery
above his ears.
Dry Valley kept indoors closely for a week except for frequent sallies after youthful
strawberry snatchers. Then, a few days later, he suddenly emerged brilliantly radiant in the
hectic glow of his belated midsummer madness.
A jay-bird-blue tennis suit covered him outwardly, almost as far as his wrists and ankles.
His shirt was ox-blood; his collar winged and tall; his necktie a floating oriflamme; his shoes
a venomous bright tan, pointed and shaped on penitential lasts. A little flat straw hat with a
striped band desecrated his weather-beaten head. Lemon-coloured kid gloves protected his
oak-tough hands from the benignant May sunshine. This sad and optic-smiting creature
teetered out of its den, smiling foolishly and smoothing its gloves for men and angels to see.
To such a pass had Dry Valley Johnson been brought by Cupid, who always shoots game that
is out of season with an arrow from the quiver of Momus. Reconstructing mythology, he had
risen, a prismatic macaw, from the ashes of the grey-brown phoenix that had folded its tired
wings to roost under the trees of Santa Rosa.
Dry Valley paused in the street to allow Santa Rosans within sight of him to be stunned;
and then deliberately and slowly, as his shoes required, entered Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s gate.
Not until the eleven months&rsquo; drought did Santa Rosa cease talking about Dry Valley
Johnson&rsquo;s courtship of Panchita O&rsquo;Brien. It was an unclassifiable procedure; something like a
combination of cake- walking, deaf-and-dumb oratory, postage stamp flirtation and parlour
charades. It lasted two weeks and then came to a sudden end.
Of course Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien favoured the match as soon as Dry Valley&rsquo;s intentions were
disclosed. Being the mother of a woman child, and therefore a charter member of the
Ancient Order of the Rat-trap, she joyfully decked out Panchita for the sacrifice. The girl was
temporarily dazzled by having her dresses lengthened and her hair piled up on her head, and
came near forgetting that she was only a slice of cheese. It was nice, too, to have as good a
match as Mr. Johnson paying you attentions and to see the other girls fluttering the curtains
at their windows to see you go by with him.
Dry Valley bought a buggy with yellow wheels and a fine trotter in San Antonio. Every
day he drove out with Panchita. He was never seen to speak to her when they were walking
or driving. The consciousness of his clothes kept his mind busy; the knowledge that he could
say nothing of interest kept him dumb; the feeling that Panchita was there kept him happy.
He took her to parties and dances, and to church. He tried&ndash;oh, no man ever tried so
hard to be young as Dry Valley did. He could not dance; but he invented a smile which he
wore on these joyous occasions, a smile that, in him, was as great a concession to mirth andgaiety as turning hand-springs would be in another. He began to seek the company of the
young men in the town&ndash;even of the boys. They accepted him as a decided damper, for his
attempts at sportiveness were so forced that they might as well have essayed their games in
a cathedral. Neither he nor any other could estimate what progress he had made with
Panchita.
The end came suddenly in one day, as often disappears the false afterglow before a
November sky and wind.
Dry Valley was to call for the girl one afternoon at six for a walk. An afternoon walk in
Santa Rosa was a feature of social life that called for the pink of one&rsquo;s wardrobe. So Dry
Valley began gorgeously to array himself; and so early that he finished early, and went over
to the O&rsquo;Brien cottage. As he neared the porch on the crooked walk from the gate he heard
sounds of revelry within. He stopped and looked through the honeysuckle vines in the open
door.
Panchita was amusing her younger brothers and sisters. She wore a man&rsquo;s clothes&ndash;no
doubt those of the late Mr. O&rsquo;Brien. On her head was the smallest brother&rsquo;s straw hat
decorated with an ink-striped paper band. On her hands were flapping yellow cloth gloves,
roughly cut out and sewn for the masquerade. The same material covered her shoes, giving
them the semblance of tan leather. High collar and flowing necktie were not omitted.
Panchita was an actress. Dry Valley saw his affectedly youthful gait, his limp where the
right shoe hurt him, his forced smile, his awkward simulation of a gallant air, all reproduced
with startling fidelity. For the first time a mirror had been held up to him. The corroboration
of one of the youngsters calling, &ldquo;Mamma, come and see Pancha do like Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; was
not needed.
As softly as the caricatured tans would permit, Dry Valley tiptoed back to the gate and
home again.
Twenty minutes after the time appointed for the walk Panchita tripped demurely out of
her gate in a thin, trim white lawn and sailor hat. She strolled up the sidewalk and slowed
her steps at Dry Valley&rsquo;s gate, her manner expressing wonder at his unusual delinquency.
Then out of his door and down the walk strode&ndash;not the polychromatic victim of a lost
summertime, but the sheepman, rehabilitated. He wore his old grey woolen shirt, open at
the throat, his brown duck trousers stuffed into his run-over boots, and his white felt
sombrero on the back of his head. Twenty years or fifty he might look; Dry Valley cared not.
His light blue eyes met Panchita&rsquo;s dark ones with a cold flash in them. He came as far as the
gate. He pointed with his long arm to her house.
&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; said Dry Valley. &ldquo;Go home to your mother. I wonder lightnin&rsquo; don&rsquo;t strike a
fool like me. Go home and play in the sand. What business have you got cavortin&rsquo; aroundwith grown men? I reckon I was locoed to be makin&rsquo; a he poll-parrot out of myself for a kid
like you. Go home and don&rsquo;t let me see you no more. Why I done it, will somebody tell me?
Go home, and let me try and forget it.&rdquo;
Panchita obeyed and walked slowly toward her home, saying nothing. For some
distance she kept her head turned and her large eyes fixed intrepidly upon Dry Valley&rsquo;s. At
her gate she stood for a moment looking back at him, then ran suddenly and swiftly into the
house.
Old Antonia was building a fire in the kitchen stove. Dry Valley stopped at the door and
laughed harshly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a pretty looking old rhinoceros to be gettin&rsquo; stuck on a kid, ain&rsquo;t I, &lsquo;Tonia?&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Not verree good thing,&rdquo; agreed Antonia, sagely, &ldquo;for too much old man to likee
muchacha.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You bet it ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dry Valley, grimly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dum foolishness; and, besides, it hurts.&rdquo;
He brought at one armful the regalia of his aberration&ndash;the blue tennis suit, shoes, hat,
gloves and all, and threw them in a pile at Antonia&rsquo;s feet.
&ldquo;Give them to your old man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to hunt antelope in.&rdquo;
Just as the first star presided palely over the twilight Dry Valley got his biggest
strawberry book and sat on the back steps to catch the last of the reading light. He thought
he saw the figure of someone in his strawberry patch. He laid aside the book, got his whip
and hurried forth to see.
It was Panchita. She had slipped through the picket fence and was half-way across the
patch. She stopped when she saw him and looked at him without wavering.
A sudden rage&ndash;a humiliating flush of unreasoning wrath&ndash;came over Dry Valley. For this
child he had made himself a motley to the view. He had tried to bribe Time to turn
backward for himself; he had&ndash;been made a fool of. At last he had seen his folly. There was a
gulf between him and youth over which he could not build a bridge even with yellow gloves
to protect his hands. And the sight of his torment coming to pester him with her elfin
pranks&ndash;coming to plunder his strawberry vines like a mischievous schoolboy&ndash;roused all his
anger.
&ldquo;I told you to keep away from here,&rdquo; said Dry Valley. &ldquo;Go back to your home.&rdquo;
Panchita moved slowly toward him.Dry Valley cracked his whip.
&ldquo;Go back home,&rdquo; said Dry Valley, savagely, &ldquo;and play theatricals some more. You&rsquo;d make
a fine man. You&rsquo;ve made a fine one of me.&rdquo;
She came a step nearer, silent, and with that strange, defiant, steady shine in her eyes
that had always puzzled him. Now it stirred his wrath.
His whiplash whistled through the air. He saw a red streak suddenly come out through
her white dress above her knee where it had struck.
Without flinching and with the same unchanging dark glow in her eyes, Panchita came
steadily toward him through the strawberry vines. Dry Valley&rsquo;s trembling hand released his
whip handle. When within a yard of him Panchita stretched out her arms.
&ldquo;God, kid!&rdquo; stammered Dry Valley, &ldquo;do you mean&ndash;?&rdquo;
But the seasons are versatile; and it may have been Springtime, after all, instead of
Indian Summer, that struck Dry Valley Johnson.
The Last Leaf （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>IIn a little district west of Washington Square the streets have run crazy and broken
themselves into small strips called &ldquo;places.&rdquo; These &ldquo;places&rdquo; make strange angles and curves.
One Street crosses itself a time or two. An artist once discovered a valuable possibility in this
street. Suppose a collector with a bill for paints, paper and canvas should, in traversing this
route, suddenly meet himself coming back, without a cent having been paid on account!
So, to quaint old Greenwich Village the art people soon came prowling, hunting for
north windows and eighteenth-century gables and Dutch attics and low rents. Then they
imported some pewter mugs and a chafing dish or two from Sixth Avenue, and became a
&ldquo;colony.&rdquo;
At the top of a squatty, three-story brick Sue and Johnsy had their studio. &ldquo;Johnsy&rdquo; was
familiar for Joanna. One was from Maine; the other from California. They had met at the
table d&rsquo;h?te of an Eighth Street &ldquo;Delmonico&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and found their tastes in art, chicory salad
and bishop sleeves so congenial that the joint studio resulted.
That was in May. In November a cold, unseen stranger, whom the doctors called
Pneumonia, stalked about the colony, touching one here and there with his icy fingers. Overon the east side this ravager strode boldly, smiting his victims by scores, but his feet trod
slowly through the maze of the narrow and moss-grown &ldquo;places.&rdquo;
Mr. Pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman. A mite of a little
woman with blood thinned by California zephyrs was hardly fair game for the red-fisted,
short-breathed old duffer. But Johnsy he smote; and she lay, scarcely moving, on her painted
iron bedstead, looking through the small Dutch window-panes at the blank side of the next
brick house.
One morning the busy doctor invited Sue into the hallway with a shaggy, grey eyebrow.
&ldquo;She has one chance in - let us say, ten,&rdquo; he said, as he shook down the mercury in his
clinical thermometer. &ldquo; And that chance is for her to want to live. This way people have of
lining-u on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopoeia look silly. Your little
lady has made up her mind that she&rsquo;s not going to get well. Has she anything on her mind?&rdquo;
&ldquo;She - she wanted to paint the Bay of Naples some day.&rdquo; said Sue.
&ldquo;Paint? - bosh! Has she anything on her mind worth thinking twice - a man for
instance?&rdquo;
&ldquo;A man?&rdquo; said Sue, with a jew&rsquo;s-harp twang in her voice. &ldquo;Is a man worth - but, no,
doctor; there is nothing of the kind.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, it is the weakness, then,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I will do all that science, so far as it
may filter through my efforts, can accomplish. But whenever my patient begins to count the
carriages in her funeral procession I subtract 50 per cent from the curative power of
medicines. If you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak
sleeves I will promise you a one-in-five chance for her, instead of one in ten.&rdquo;
After the doctor had gone Sue went into the workroom and cried a Japanese napkin to
a pulp. Then she swaggered into Johnsy&rsquo;s room with her drawing board, whistling ragtime.
Johnsy lay, scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes, with her face toward the
window. Sue stopped whistling, thinking she was asleep.
She arranged her board and began a pen-and-ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story.
Young artists must pave their way to Art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young
authors write to pave their way to Literature.
As Sue was sketching a pair of elegant horseshow riding trousers and a monocle of the
figure of the hero, an Idaho cowboy, she heard a low sound, several times repeated. She
went quickly to the bedside.Johnsy&rsquo;s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting -
counting backward.
&ldquo;Twelve,&rdquo; she said, and little later &ldquo;eleven&rdquo;; and then &ldquo;ten,&rdquo; and &ldquo;nine&rdquo;; and then
&ldquo;eight&rdquo; and &ldquo;seven&rdquo;, almost together.
Sue look solicitously out of the window. What was there to count? There was only a
bare, dreary yard to be seen, and the blank side of the brick house twenty feet away. An old,
old ivy vine, gnarled and decayed at the roots, climbed half way up the brick wall. The cold
breath of autumn had stricken its leaves from the vine until its skeleton branches clung,
almost bare, to the crumbling bricks.
&ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo; asked Sue.
&ldquo;Six,&rdquo; said Johnsy, in almost a whisper. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re falling faster now. Three days ago there
were almost a hundred. It made my head ache to count them. But now it&rsquo;s easy. There goes
another one. There are only five left now.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Five what, dear? Tell your Sudie.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Leaves. On the ivy vine. When the last one falls I must go, too. I&rsquo;ve known that for
three days. Didn&rsquo;t the doctor tell you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, I never heard of such nonsense,&rdquo; complained Sue, with magnificent scorn. &ldquo;What
have old ivy leaves to do with your getting well? And you used to love that vine so, you
naughty girl. Don&rsquo;t be a goosey. Why, the doctor told me this morning that your chances for
getting well real soon were - let&rsquo;s see exactly what he said - he said the chances were ten to
one! Why, that&rsquo;s almost as good a chance as we have in New York when we ride on the
street cars or walk past a new building. Try to take some broth now, and let Sudie go back to
her drawing, so she can sell the editor man with it, and buy port wine for her sick child, and
pork chops for her greedy self.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t get any more wine,&rdquo; said Johnsy, keeping her eyes fixed out the window.
&ldquo;There goes another. No, I don&rsquo;t want any broth. That leaves just four. I want to see the last
one fall before it gets dark. Then I&rsquo;ll go, too.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Johnsy, dear,&rdquo; said Sue, bending over her, &ldquo;will you promise me to keep your eyes
closed, and not look out the window until I am done working? I must hand those drawings in
by to-morrow. I need the light, or I would draw the shade down.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you draw in the other room?&rdquo; asked Johnsy, coldly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be here by you,&rdquo; said Sue. &ldquo;Beside, I don&rsquo;t want you to keep looking at those
silly ivy leaves.&ldquo;&ldquo;Tell me as soon as you have finished,&rdquo; said Johnsy, closing her eyes, and lying white
and still as fallen statue, &ldquo;because I want to see the last one fall. I&rsquo;m tired of waiting. I&rsquo;m
tired of thinking. I want to turn loose my hold on everything, and go sailing down, down, just
like one of those poor, tired leaves.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Try to sleep,&rdquo; said Sue. &ldquo;I must call Behrman up to be my model for the old hermit
miner. I&rsquo;ll not be gone a minute. Don&rsquo;t try to move &lsquo;til I come back.&rdquo;
Old Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor beneath them. He was past
sixty and had a Michael Angelo&rsquo;s Moses beard curling down from the head of a satyr along
with the body of an imp. Behrman was a failure in art. Forty years he had wielded the brush
without getting near enough to touch the hem of his Mistress&rsquo;s robe. He had been always
about to paint a masterpiece, but had never yet begun it. For several years he had painted
nothing except now and then a daub in the line of commerce or advertising. He earned a
little by serving as a model to those young artists in the colony who could not pay the price
of a professional. He drank gin to excess, and still talked of his coming masterpiece. For the
rest he was a fierce little old man, who scoffed terribly at softness in any one, and who
regarded himself as especial mastiff-in-waiting to protect the two young artists in the studio
above.
Sue found Behrman smelling strongly of juniper berries in his dimly lighted den below.
In one corner was a blank canvas on an easel that had been waiting there for twenty-five
years to receive the first line of the masterpiece. She told him of Johnsy&rsquo;s fancy, and how she
feared she would, indeed, light and fragile as a leaf herself, float away, when her slight hold
upon the world grew weaker.
Old Behrman, with his red eyes plainly streaming, shouted his contempt and derision
for such idiotic imaginings.
&ldquo;Vass!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Is dere people in de world mit der foolishness to die because leafs
dey drop off from a confounded vine? I haf not heard of such a thing. No, I will not bose as a
model for your fool hermit-dunderhead. Vy do you allow dot silly pusiness to come in der
brain of her? Ach, dot poor leetle Miss Yohnsy.&rdquo;
&ldquo;She is very ill and weak,&rdquo; said Sue, &ldquo;and the fever has left her mind morbid and full of
strange fancies. Very well, Mr. Behrman, if you do not care to pose for me, you needn&rsquo;t. But I
think you are a horrid old - old flibbertigibbet.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You are just like a woman!&rdquo; yelled Behrman. &ldquo;Who said I will not bose? Go on. I come
mit you. For half an hour I haf peen trying to say dot I am ready to bose. Gott! dis is not any
blace in which one so goot as Miss Yohnsy shall lie sick. Some day I vill baint a masterpiece,
and ve shall all go away. Gott! yes.&ldquo;Johnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs. Sue pulled the shade down to the
window-sill, and motioned Behrman into the other room. In there they peered out the
window fearfully at the ivy vine. Then they looked at each other for a moment without
speaking. A persistent, cold rain was falling, mingled with snow. Behrman, in his old blue
shirt, took his seat as the hermit miner on an upturned kettle for a rock.
When Sue awoke from an hour&rsquo;s sleep the next morning she found Johnsy with dull,
wide-open eyes staring at the drawn green shade.
&ldquo;Pull it up; I want to see,&rdquo; she ordered, in a whisper.
Wearily Sue obeyed.
But, lo! after the beating rain and fierce gusts of wind that had endured through the
livelong night, there yet stood out against the brick wall one ivy leaf. It was the last one on
the vine. Still dark green near its stem, with its serrated edges tinted with the yellow of
dissolution and decay, it hung bravely from the branch some twenty feet above the ground.
&ldquo;It is the last one,&rdquo; said Johnsy. &ldquo;I thought it would surely fall during the night. I heard
the wind. It will fall to-day, and I shall die at the same time.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; said Sue, leaning her worn face down to the pillow, &ldquo;think of me, if you
won&rsquo;t think of yourself. What would I do?&rdquo;
But Johnsy did not answer. The lonesomest thing in all the world is a soul when it is
making ready to go on its mysterious, far journey. The fancy seemed to possess her more
strongly as one by one the ties that bound her to friendship and to earth were loosed.
The day wore away, and even through the twilight they could see the lone ivy leaf
clinging to its stem against the wall. And then, with the coming of the night the north wind
was again loosed, while the rain still beat against the windows and pattered down from the
low Dutch eaves.
When it was light enough Johnsy, the merciless, commanded that the shade be raised.
The ivy leaf was still there.
Johnsy lay for a long time looking at it. And then she called to Sue, who was stirring her
chicken broth over the gas stove.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a bad girl, Sudie,&rdquo; said Johnsy. &ldquo;Something has made that last leaf stay there
to show me how wicked I was. It is a sin to want to die. You may bring a me a little broth now,
and some milk with a little port in it, and - no; bring me a hand-mirror first, and then pack
some pillows about me, and I will sit up and watch you cook.&ldquo;And hour later she said:
&ldquo;Sudie, some day I hope to paint the Bay of Naples.&rdquo;
The doctor came in the afternoon, and Sue had an excuse to go into the hallway as he
left.
&ldquo;Even chances,&rdquo; said the doctor, taking Sue&rsquo;s thin, shaking hand in his. &ldquo;With good
nursing you&rsquo;ll win.&rdquo; And now I must see another case I have downstairs. Behrman, his name
is - some kind of an artist, I believe. Pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man, and the attack
is acute. There is no hope for him; but he goes to the hospital to-day to be made more
comfortable.&rdquo;
The next day the doctor said to Sue: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s out of danger. You won. Nutrition and care
now - that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
And that afternoon Sue came to the bed where Johnsy lay, contentedly knitting a very
blue and very useless woollen shoulder scarf, and put one arm around her, pillows and all.
&ldquo;I have something to tell you, white mouse,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr. Behrman died of
pneumonia to-day in the hospital. He was ill only two days. The janitor found him the
morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain. His shoes and clothing
were wet through and icy cold. They couldn&rsquo;t imagine where he had been on such a dreadful
night. And then they found a lantern, still lighted, and a ladder that had been dragged from
its place, and some scattered brushes, and a palette with green and yellow colours mixed on
it, and - look out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn&rsquo;t you wonder why it
never fluttered or moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it&rsquo;s Behrman&rsquo;s masterpiece - he
painted it there the night that the last leaf fell.&rdquo;
A Little Local Colour （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>I mentioned to Rivington that I was in search of characteristic New York scenes and
incidents &ndash; some- thing typical, I told him, without necessarily having to spell the first
syllable with an &ldquo;i.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, for your writing business,&rdquo; said Rivington; &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t have applied to a better
shop. What I don&rsquo;t know about little old New York wouldn&rsquo;t make a sonnet to a sunbonnet.I&rsquo;ll put you right in the middle of so much local colour that you won&rsquo;t know whether you are
a magazine cover or in the erysipelas ward. When do you want to begin?&rdquo;
Rivington is a young-man-about-town and a New Yorker by birth, preference and
incommutability.
I told him that I would be glad to accept his escort and guardianship so that I might take
notes of Manhattan&rsquo;s grand, gloomy and peculiar idiosyncrasies, and that the time of so
doing would be at his own convenience.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll begin this very evening,&rdquo; said Rivington, him- self interested, like a good fellow.
&ldquo;Dine with me at seven, and then I&rsquo;ll steer &lsquo;you up against metropolitan phases so thick
you&rsquo;ll have to have a kinetoscope to record &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
So I dined with Rivington pleasantly at his club, in Forty-eleventh street, and then we
set forth in pursuit of the elusive tincture of affairs.
As we came out of the club there stood two men on the sidewalk near the steps in
earnest conversation.
&ldquo;And by what process of ratiocination,&rdquo; said one of them, &ldquo;do you arrive at the
conclusion that the division of society into producing and non-possessing classes predicates
failure when compared with competitive systems that are monopolizing in tendency and
result inimically to industrial evolution?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, come off your perch!&rdquo; said the other man, who wore glasses. &ldquo;Your premises
won&rsquo;t come out in the wash. You wind-jammers who apply bandy-legged theories to
concrete categorical syllogisms send logical conclusions skallybootin&rsquo; into the infinitesimal
ragbag. You can&rsquo;t pull my leg with an old sophism with whiskers on it. You quote Marx and
Hyndman and Kautsky - what are they? &ndash; shines! Tolstoi? &ndash; his garret is full of rats. I put it to
you over the home-plate that the idea of a cooperative commonwealth and an abolishment
of competitive systems simply takes the rag off the bush and gives me hyperesthesia of the
roopteetoop! The skoo- kum house for yours!
I stopped a few yards away and took out my little notebook.
&ldquo;Oh, come ahead,&rdquo; said Rivington, somewhat ner- vously; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want to listen to
that.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why man,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;this is just what I do want to hear. These slang types are
among your city&rsquo;s most distinguishing features. Is this the Bowery variety? I really must hear
more of it.&ldquo;&ldquo;If I follow you,&rdquo; said the man who had spoken flrst, &ldquo;you do not believe it possible to
reorganize society on the basis of common interest?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shinny on your own side!&rdquo; said the man with glasses. &ldquo;You never heard any such music
from my foghorn. What I said was that I did not believe it practicable just now. The guys with
wads are not in the frame of mind to slack up on the mazuma, and the man with the
portable tin banqueting canister isn&rsquo;t exactly ready to join the Bible class. You can bet your
variegated socks that the situation is all spifflicated up from the Battery to breakfast! What
the country needs is for some bully old bloke like Cobden or some wise guy like old Ben
Frank- lin to sashay up to the front and biff the nigger&rsquo;s head with the baseball. Do you catch
my smoke? What?&rdquo;
Rivington pulled me by the arm impatiently.
&ldquo;Please come on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go see something. This isn&rsquo;t what you want.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Indeed, it is,&rdquo; I said resisting. &ldquo;This tough talk is the very stuff that counts. There is a
picturesqueness about the speech of the lower order of people that is quite unique. Did you
say that this is the Bowery variety of slang?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Rivington, giving it up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you straight. That&rsquo;s one of our college
professors talking. He ran down for a day or two at the club. It&rsquo;s a sort of fad with him lately
to use slang in his conversation. He thinks it improves language. The man he is talking to is
one of New York&rsquo;s famous social economists. Now will you come on. You can&rsquo;t use that, you
know.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I agreed; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t use that. Would you call that typical of New York?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Rivington, with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you see the difference.
But if you want to hear the real old tough Bowery slang I&rsquo;ll take you down where you&rsquo;ll get
your fill of it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I would like it,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;that is, if it&rsquo;s the real thing. I&rsquo;ve often read it in books, but I
never heard it. Do you think it will be dangerous to go unprotected among those
characters ?
&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Rivington; &ldquo;not at this time of night. To tell the truth, I haven&rsquo;t been
along the Bowery in a long time, but I know it as well as I do Broadway. We&rsquo;ll look up some
of the typical Bowery boys and get them to talk. It&rsquo;ll be worth your while. They talk a
peculiar dialect that you won&rsquo;t hear any-where else on earth.&rdquo;
Rivington and I went east in a Forty-second street car and then south on the Third
avenue line.At Houston street we got off and walked.
&ldquo;We are now on the famous Bowery,&rdquo; said Rivington; &ldquo;the Bowery celebrated in song
and story.&rdquo;
We passed block after block of &ldquo;gents&rsquo;&rdquo; furnishing stores &ndash; the windows full of shirts
with prices attached and cuffs inside. In other windows were neckties and no shirts. People
walked up and down the sidewalks.
&ldquo;In some ways,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this reminds me of Koko- mono, Ind., during the peach-crating
season.&rdquo;
Rivington was nettled.
&ldquo;Step into one of these saloons or vaudeville shows,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with a large roll of
money, and see how quickly the Bowery will sustain its reputation.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You make impossible conditions,&rdquo; said I, coldly.
By and by Rivington stopped and said we were in the heart of the Bowery. There was a
policeman on the corner whom Rivington knew.
&ldquo;Hallo, Donahue!&rdquo; said my guide. &ldquo;How goes it? My friend and I are down this way
looking up a bit of local colour. He&rsquo;s anxious to meet one of the Bowery types. Can&rsquo;t you put
us on to something genuine in that line &ndash; something that&rsquo;s got the colour, you know?&rdquo;
Policeman Donahue turned himself about ponder- ously, his florid face full of
good-nature. He pointed with his club down the street.
&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;Here comes a lad now that was born on the Bowery and knows
every inch of it. If he&rsquo;s ever been above Bleecker street he&rsquo;s kept it to himself.&rdquo;
A man about twenty-eight or twenty-nine, with a smooth face, was sauntering toward
us with his hands in his coat pockets. Policeman Donahue stopped him with a courteous
wave of his club.
&ldquo;Evening, Kerry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a couple of gents, friends of mine, that want to hear
you spiel something about the Bowery. Can you reel &lsquo;em off a few yards?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Certainly, Donahue,&rdquo; said the young man, pleas- antly. &ldquo;Good evening, gentlemen,&rdquo; he
said to us, with a pleasant smile. Donahue walked off on his beat.
&ldquo;This is the goods,&rdquo; whispered Rivington, nudging me with his elbow. &ldquo;Look at his jaw!&rdquo;&ldquo;Say, cull,&rdquo; said Rivington, pushing back his hat, wot&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;? Me and my friend&rsquo;s taking
a look down de old line &ndash; see? De copper tipped us off dat you was wise to de bowery. Is dat
right?&rdquo;
I could not help admiring Rivington&rsquo;s power of adapt- ing himself to his surroundings.
&ldquo;Donahue was right,&rdquo; said the young man, frankly; &ldquo;I was brought up on the Bowery. I
have been news- boy, teamster, pugilist, member of an organized band of &lsquo;toughs,&rsquo; bartender,
and a &lsquo;sport&rsquo; in various mean- ings of the word. The experience certainly warrants the
supposition that I have at least a passing acquaintance with a few phases of Bowery life. I
will be pleased to place whatever knowledge and experience I have at the service of my
friend Donahue&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo;
Rivington seemed ill at ease.
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said &ndash; somewhat entreatingly, &ldquo;I thought &ndash; you&rsquo;re not stringing us, are you?
It isn&rsquo;t just the kind of talk we expected. You haven&rsquo;t even said &lsquo;Hully gee!&rsquo; once. Do you
really belong on the Bowery?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said the Bowery boy, smilingly, &ldquo;that at some time you have been enticed
into one of the dives of literature and had the counterfeit coin of the Bowery passed upon
you. The &lsquo;argot&rsquo; to which you doubtless refer was the invention of certain of your literary
&lsquo;dis- coverers&rsquo; who invaded the unknown wilds below Third avenue and put strange sounds
into the mouths of the inhabitants. Safe in their homes far to the north and west, the
credulous readers who were beguiled by this new &lsquo;dialect&rsquo; perused and believed. Like Marco
Polo and Mungo Park &ndash; pioneers indeed, but ambitious souls who could not draw the line of
demarcation between dis- covery and invention &ndash; the literary bones of these explorers are
dotting the trackless wastes of the sub- way. While it is true that after the publication of the
mythical language attributed to the dwellers along the Bowery certain of its pat phrases and
apt metaphors were adopted and, to a limited extent, used in this locality, it was because
our people are prompt in assimilating whatever is to their commercial advantage. To the
tourists who visited our newly discovered clime, and who expected a realization of their
literary guide books, they supplied the demands of the market.
&ldquo;But perhaps I am wandering from the question. In what way can I assist you,
gentlemen? I beg you will believe that the hospitality of the street is extended to all. There
are, I regret to say, many catchpenny places of entertainment, but I cannot conceive that
they would entice you.&rdquo;
I felt Rivington lean somewhat heavily against me. &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he remarked, with uncertain
utterance; &ldquo;come and have a drink with us.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thank you, but I never drink. I find that alcohol, even in the smallest quantities, alters
the perspective. And I must preserve my perspective, for I am studyinc, the Bowery. I havelived in it nearly thirty years, and I am just beginning to understand its heartbeats. It is like a
great river fed by a hundred alien streams. Each influx brings strange seeds on its flood,
strange silt and weeds, and now and then a flower of rare promise. To construe this river
requires a man who can build dykes against the overflow, who is a naturalist, a geologist, a
humanitarian, a diver and a strong swimmer. I love my Bowery. It was my cradle and is my
inspiration. I have published one book. The critics have been kind. I put my heart in it. I am
writing another, into which I hope to put both heart and brain. Consider me your guide,
gentlemen. Is there arything I can take you to see, any place to which I can conduct you?&rdquo;
I was afraid to look at Rivington except with one eye.
&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Rivington. &ldquo;We were looking up &hellip; that is &hellip; my friend &hellip; confound it;
it&rsquo;s against all precedent, you know &hellip; awfully obliged &hellip; just the same.&rdquo;
&ldquo;In case,&rdquo; said our friend, &ldquo;you would like to meet some of our Bowery young men I
would be pleased to have you visit the quarters of our East Side Kappa Delta Phi Society, only
two blocks east of here.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Awfully sorry,&rdquo; said Rivington, &ldquo;but my friend&rsquo;s got me on the jump to-nioht. He&rsquo;s a
terror when he&rsquo;s out after local colour. Now, there&rsquo;s nothing I would like better than to drop
in at the Kappa Delta Phi, but &ndash; some other time!&rdquo;
We said our farewells and boarded a home-bound car. We had a rabbit on upper
Broadway, and then I parted with Rivington on a street corner.
&ldquo;Well, anyhow,&rdquo; said he, braced and recovered, &ldquo;it couldn&rsquo;t have happened anywhere
but in little old New York.&rdquo;
Which to say the least, was typical of Rivington.
A Little Talk About Mobs （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; remarked the tall gentleman in the frock coat and black slouch hat, &ldquo;that
another street car motorman in your city has narrowly excaped lynching at the hands of an
infuriated mob by lighting a cigar and walking a couple of blocks down the street.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do you think they would have lynched him?&rdquo; asked the New Yorker, in the next seat of
the ferry station, who was also waiting for the boat.&ldquo;Not until after the election,&rdquo; said the tall man, cutting a corner off his plug of tobacco.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in your city long enough to know something about your mobs. The motorman&rsquo;s
mob is about the least dangerous of them all, except the National Guard and the
Dressmakers&rsquo; Convention.
&ldquo;You see, when little Willie Goldstein is sent by his mother for pigs&rsquo; knuckles, with a
nickel tightly grasped in his chubby fist, he always crosses the street car track safely twenty
feet ahead of the car; and then suddenly turns back to ask his inother whether it was pale
ale or a spool of 80 white cotton that she wanted. The motorman yells and throws himself
on the brakes like a football player. There is a horrible grinding and then a ripping sound,
and a piercing shriek, and Willie is sitting, with part of his trousers torn away by the fender,
screaming for his lost nickel.
&ldquo;In ten seconds the car is surrounded by 600 infuriated citizens, crying, &lsquo;Lynch the
motorman! Lynch the motorman!&rsquo; at the top of their voices. Some of them run to the
nearest cigar store to get a rope; but they find the last one has just been cut up and labelled.
Hundreds of the excited mob press close to the cowering motorman, whose hand is
observed to tremble perceptibly as he transfers a stick of pepsin gum from his pocket to his
mouth.
&ldquo;When the bloodthirsty mob of maddened citizens has closed in on the motorman,
some bringing camp stools and sitting quite close to him, and all shouting, &lsquo;Lynch him!&rsquo;
Policeman Fogarty forces his way through them to the side of their prospective victim.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Hello, Mike,&rsquo; says the motorman in a low voice, &lsquo;nice day. Shall I sneak off a block or so,
or would you like to rescue me?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Jerry, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; says the policeman, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to disperse the infuriated
mob singlehanded. I haven&rsquo;t defeated a lynching mob since last Tuesday; and that was a
small one of only 300, that wanted to string up a Dago boy for selling wormy pears. It would
boost me some down at the station.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;All right, Mike,&rsquo; says the motorman, &lsquo;anything to oblige. I&rsquo;ll turn pale and tremble.&rsquo;
&ldquo;And he does so; and Policeman Fogarty draws his club and says, &lsquo;G&rsquo;wan wid yez!&rsquo; and
in eight seconds the desperate mob has scattered and gone about its business, except about
a hundred who remain to search for Willie&rsquo;s nickel.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I never heard of a mob in our city doing violence to a motorman because of an
accident,&rdquo; said the New Yorker.
&ldquo;You are not liable to,&rdquo; said the tall man. &ldquo;They know the motorman&rsquo;s all right, and that
he wouldn&rsquo;t even run over a stray dog if he could help it. And they know that not a manamong &lsquo;em would tie the knot to hang even a Thomas cat that had been tried and
condemned and sentenced according to law.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then why do they become infuriated and make threats of lynching?&rdquo; asked the New
Yorker.
&ldquo;To assure the motorman,&rdquo; answered the tall man, &ldquo;that he is safe. If they really wanted
to do him up they would go into the houses and drop bricks on him from the third-story
windows.&rdquo;
&ldquo;New Yorkers are not cowards,&rdquo; said the other man, a little stiffly.
&ldquo;Not one at a time,&rdquo; agreed the tall man, promptly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a fine lot of
single-handed scrappers in your town. I&rsquo;d rather fight three of you than one; and I&rsquo;d go up
against all the Gas Trust&rsquo;s victims in a bunch before I&rsquo;d pass two citizens on a dark corner,
with my watch chain showing. When you get rounded up in a bunch you lose your nerve.
Get you in crowds and you&rsquo;re easy. Ask the &lsquo;L&rsquo; road guards and George B. Cortelyou and the
tintype booths at Coney Island. Divided you stand, united you fall. E pluribus nihil. Whenever
one of your mobs surrounds a man and begins to holler, &ldquo;Lynch him!&rsquo; he says to himself, &ldquo;Oh,
dear, I suppose I must look pale to please the boys, but I will, forsooth, let my life insurance
premium lapse to-morrow. This is a sure tip for me to play Methuselah straight across the
board in the next handicap.&rsquo;
&ldquo;I can imagine the tortured feelings of a prisoner in the hands of New York policemen
when an infuriated mob demands that he be turned over to them for lynching. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s
sake, officers,&rsquo; cries the distracted wretch, &lsquo;have ye hearts of stone, that ye will not let them
wrest me from ye?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Sorry, Jimmy,&rsquo; says one of the policemen, &lsquo;but it won&rsquo;t do. There&rsquo;s three of us&ndash;me and
Darrel and the plain-clothes man; and there&rsquo;s only sivin thousand of the mob. How&rsquo;d we
explain it at the office if they took ye? Jist chase the infuriated aggregation around the
corner, Darrel, and we&rsquo;ll be movin&rsquo; along to the station.&lsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Some of our gatherings of excited citizens have not been so harmless,&rdquo; said the New
Yorker, with a faint note of civic pride.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit that,&rdquo; said the tall man. &ldquo;A cousin of mine who was on a visit here once had
an arm broken and lost an ear in one of them.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That must have been during the Cooper Union riots,&rdquo; remarked the New Yorker.
&ldquo;Not the Cooper Union,&rdquo; explained the tall man&ndash;&ldquo;but it was a union riot&ndash;at the
Vanastor wedding.&ldquo;&ldquo;You seem to be in favor of lynch law,&rdquo; said the New Yorker, severely.
&ldquo;No, sir, I am not. No intelligent man is. But, sir, there are certain cases when people
rise in their just majesty and take a righteous vengeance for crimes that the law is slow in
punishing. I am an advocate of law and order, but I will say to you that less than six months
ago I myself assisted at the lynching of one &ldquo;of that race that is creating a wide chasm
between your section of country and mine, sir.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is a deplorable condition,&rdquo; said the New Yorker, &ldquo;that exists in the South, but&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am from Indiana, sir,&rdquo; said the tall man, taking another chew; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t think you
will condemn my course when I tell you that the colored man in question had stolen $9.60 in
cash, sir, from my own brother.&rdquo;
Lost on Dress Parade （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Mr. Towers Chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom. One iron was
heating on a small gas stove; the other was being pushed vigorously back and forth to make
the desirable crease that would be seen later on extending in straight lines from Mr.
Chandler&rsquo;s patent leather shoes to the edge of his low-cut vest. So much of the hero&rsquo;s toilet
may be intrusted to our confidence. The remainder may be guessed by those whom genteel
poverty has driven to ignoble expedient. Our next view of him shall be as he descends the
steps of his lodging-house immaculately and correctly clothed; calm, assured, handsome&ndash;in
appearance the typical New York young clubman setting out, slightly bored, to inaugurate
the pleasures of the evening.
Chandler&rsquo;s honorarium was $18 per week. He was employed in the office of an
architect. He was twenty-two years old; he considered architecture to be truly an art; and he
honestly believed&ndash;though he would not have dared to admit it in New York&ndash;that the
Flatiron Building was inferior to design to the great cathedral in Milan.
Out of each week&rsquo;s earnings Chandler set aside $1. At the end of each ten weeks with
the extra capital thus accumulated, he purchased one gentleman&rsquo;s evening from the bargain
counter of stingy old Father Time. He arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and
presidents; he took himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest, and there
dined with taste and luxury. With ten dollars a man may, for a few hours, play the wealthy
idler to perfection. The sum is ample for a well-considered meal, a bottle bearing a
respectable label, commensurate tips, a smoke, cab fare and the ordinary etceteras.This one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to Chandler a source of
renascent bliss. To the society bud comes but one debut; it stands alone sweet in her
memory when her hair has whitened; but to Chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen,
as thrilling, as new as the first had been. To sit among bon vivants under palms in the swirl of
concealed music, to look upon the habitues of such a paradise and to be looked upon by
them&ndash;what is a girl&rsquo;s first dance and short-sleeved tulle compared with this?
Up Broadway Chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade. For this evening he
was an exhibit as well as a gazer. For the next sixty-nine evenings he would be dining in
cheviot and worsted at dubious table d&rsquo;hotes, at whirlwind lunch counters, on sandwiches
and beer in his hall-bedroom. He was willing to do that, for he was a true son of the great
city of razzle-dazzle, and to him one evening in the limelight made up for many dark ones.
Chandler protracted his walk until the Forties began to intersect the great and glittering
primrose way, for the evening was yet young, and when one is of the beau monde only one
day in seventy, one loves to protract the pleasure. Eyes bright, sinister, curious, admiring,
provocative, alluring were bent upon him, for his garb and air proclaimed him a devotee to
the hour of solace and pleasure.
At a certain corner he came to a standstill, proposing to himself the question of turning
back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in which he usually dined on the
evenings of his especial luxury. Just then a girl scuddled lightly around the corner, slipped on
a patch of icy snow and fell plump upon the sidewalk.
Chandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy. The girl hobbled
to the wall of the building, leaned against it, and thanked him demurely.
&ldquo;I think my ankle is strained,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It twisted when I fell.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Does it pain you much?&rdquo; inquired Chandler.
&ldquo;Only when I rest my weight upon it. I think I will be able to walk in a minute or two.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If I can be of any further service,&rdquo; suggested the young man, &ldquo;I will call a cab, or&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the girl, softly but heartily. &ldquo;I am sure you need not trouble yourself
any further. It was so awkward of me. And my shoe heels are horridly common-sense; I can&rsquo;t
blame them at all.&rdquo;
Chandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest. She was pretty in
a refined way; and her eye was both merry and kind. She was inexpensively clothed in a
plain black dress that suggested a sort of uniform such as shop girls wear. Her glossy
dark-brown hair showed its coils beneath a cheap hat of black straw whose only ornamentwas a velvet ribbon and bow. She could have posed as a model for the self-respecting
working girl of the best type.
A sudden idea came into the head of the young architect. He would ask this girl to dine
with him. Here was the element that his splendid but solitary periodic feasts had lacked. His
brief season of elegant luxury would be doubly enjoyable if he could add to it a lady&rsquo;s society.
This girl was a lady, he was sure&ndash;her manner and speech settled that. And in spite of her
extremely plain attire he felt that he would be pleased to sit at table with her.
These thoughts passed swiftly through his mind, and he decided to ask her. It was a
breach of etiquette, of course, but oftentimes wage- earning girls waived formalities in
matters of this kind. They were generally shrewd judges of men; and thought better of their
own judgment than they did of useless conventions. His ten dollars, discreetly expended,
would enable the two to dine very well indeed. The dinner would no doubt be a wonderful
experience thrown into the dull routine of the girl&rsquo;s life; and her lively appreciation of it
would add to his own triumph and pleasure.
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said to her, with frank gravity, &ldquo;that your foot needs a longer rest than you
suppose. Now, I am going to suggest a way in which you can give it that and at the same
time do me a favour. I was on my way to dine all by my lonely self when you came tumbling
around the corner. You come with me and we&rsquo;ll have a cozy dinner and a pleasant talk
together, and by that time your game ankle will carry you home very nicely, I am sure.&rdquo;
The girl looked quickly up into Chandler&rsquo;s clear, pleasant countenance. Her eyes
twinkled once very brightly, and then she smiled ingenuously.
&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t know each other&ndash;it wouldn&rsquo;t be right, would it?&rdquo; she said, doubtfully.
&ldquo;There is nothing wrong about it,&rdquo; said the young man, candidly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll introduce
myself&ndash;permit me&ndash;Mr. Towers Chandler. After our dinner, which I will try to make as
pleasant as possible, I will bid you good-evening, or attend you safely to your door,
whichever you prefer.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But, dear me!&rdquo; said the girl, with a glance at Chandler&rsquo;s faultless attire. &ldquo;In this old
dress and hat!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; said Chandler, cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you look more charming in them
than any one we shall see in the most elaborate dinner toilette.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My ankle does hurt yet,&rdquo; admitted the girl, attempting a limping step. &ldquo;I think I will
accept your invitation, Mr. Chandler. You may call me&ndash;Miss Marian.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Come then, Miss Marian,&rdquo; said the young architect, gaily, but with perfect courtesy;
&ldquo;you will not have far to walk. There is a very respectable and good restaurant in the nextblock. You will have to lean on my arm&ndash;so&ndash;and walk slowly. It is lonely dining all by one&rsquo;s
self. I&rsquo;m just a little bit glad that you slipped on the ice.&rdquo;
When the two were established at a well-appointed table, with a promising waiter
hovering in attendance, Chandler began to experience the real joy that his regular outing
always brought to him.
The restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down Broadway,
which he always preferred, but it was nearly so. The tables were well filled with
Prosperous-looking diners, there was a good orchestra, playing softly enough to make
conversation a possible pleasure, and the cuisine and service were beyond criticism. His
companion, even in her cheap hat and dress, held herself with an air that added distinction
to the natural beauty of her face and figure. And it is certain that she looked at Chandler,
with his animated but self-possessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes, with
something not far from admiration in her own charming face.
Then it was that the Madness of Manhattan, the frenzy of Fuss and Feathers, the
Bacillus of Brag, the Provincial Plague of Pose seized upon Towers Chandler. He was on
Broadway, surrounded by pomp and style, and there were eyes to look at him. On the stage
of that comedy he had assumed to play the one-night part of a butterfly of fashion and an
idler of means and taste. He was dressed for the part, and all his good angels had not the
power to prevent him from acting it.
So he began to prate to Miss Marian of clubs, of teas, of golf and riding and kennels and
cotillions and tours abroad and threw out hints of a yacht lying at Larchmont. He could see
that she was vastly impressed by this vague talk, so he endorsed his pose by random
insinuations concerning great wealth, and mentioned familiarly a few names that are
handled reverently by the proletariat. It was Chandler&rsquo;s short little day, and he was wringing
from it the best that could be had, as he saw it. And yet once or twice he saw the pure gold
of this girl shine through the mist that his egotism had raised between him and all objects.
&ldquo;This way of living that you speak of,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;sounds so futile and purposeless.
Haven&rsquo;t you any work to do in the world that might interest you more?&rdquo;
&ldquo;My dear Miss Marian,&rdquo; he exclaimed&ndash;&ldquo;work! Think of dressing every day for dinner, of
making half a dozen calls in an afternoon&ndash;with a policeman at every corner ready to jump
into your auto and take you to the station, if you get up any greater speed than a donkey
cart&rsquo;s gait. We do-nothings are the hardest workers in the land.&rdquo;
The dinner was concluded, the waiter generously fed, and the two walked out to the
corner where they had met. Miss Marian walked very well now; her limp was scarcely
noticeable.&ldquo;Thank you for a nice time,&rdquo; she said, frankly. &ldquo;I must run home now. I liked the dinner
very much, Mr. Chandler.&rdquo;
He shook hands with her, smiling cordially, and said something about a game of bridge
at his club. He watched her for a moment, walking rather rapidly eastward, and then he
found a cab to drive him slowly homeward.
In his chilly bedroom Chandler laid away his evening clothes for a sixty-nine days&rsquo; rest.
He went about it thoughtfully.
&ldquo;That was a stunning girl,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right, too, I&rsquo;d be sworn, even if
she does have to work. Perhaps if I&rsquo;d told her the truth instead of all that razzle-dazzle we
might&ndash;but, confound it! I had to play up to my clothes.&rdquo;
Thus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the tribe of the
Manhattans.
The girl, after leaving her entertainer, sped swiftly cross-town until she arrived at a
handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east, facing on that avenue which is the
highway of Mammon and the auxiliary gods. Here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a
room where a handsome young lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously out
the window.
&ldquo;Oh, you madcap!&rdquo; exclaimed the elder girl, when the other entered. &ldquo;When will you
quit frightening us this way? It is two hours since you ran out in that rag of an old dress and
Marie&rsquo;s hat. Mamma has been so alarmed. She sent Louis in the auto to try to find you. You
are a bad, thoughtless Puss.&rdquo;
The elder girl touched a button, and a maid came in a moment.
&ldquo;Marie, tell mamma that Miss Marian has returned.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scold, sister. I only ran down to Mme. Theo&rsquo;s to tell her to use mauve insertion
instead of pink. My costume and Marie&rsquo;s hat were just what I needed. Every one thought I
was a shopgirl, I am sure.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dinner is over, dear; you stayed so late.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know. I slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle. I could not walk, so I hobbled
into a restaurant and sat there until I was better. That is why I was so long.&rdquo;
The two girls sat in the window seat, looking out at the lights and the stream of
hurrying vehicles in the avenue. The younger one cuddled down with her head in her sister&rsquo;s
lap.&ldquo;We will have to marry some day,&rdquo; she said dreamily&ndash;&rdquo; both of us. We have so much
money that we will not be allowed to disappoint the public. Do you want me to tell you the
kind of a man I could love, Sis?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Go on, you scatterbrain,&rdquo; smiled the other.
&ldquo;I could love a man with dark and kind blue eyes, who is gentle and respectful to poor
girls, who is handsome and good and does not try to flirt. But I could love him only if he had
an ambition, an object, some work to do in the world. I would not care how poor he was if I
could help him build his way up. But, sister dear, the kind of man we always meet&ndash;the man
who lives an idle life between society and his clubs&ndash;I could not love a man like that, even if
his eyes were blue and he were ever so kind to poor girls whom he met in the street.&rdquo;
The Love-Philtre of Ikey Schoenstein （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The Blue Light Drug Store is downtown, between the Bowery and First Avenue, where
the distance between the two streets is the shortest. The Blue Light does not consider that
pharmacy is a thing of bric-a- brac, scent and ice-cream soda. If you ask it for pain-killer it
will not give you a bonbon.
The Blue Light scorns the labour-saving arts of modern pharmacy. It macerates its
opium and percolates its own laudanum and paregoric. To this day pills are made behind its
tall prcscription desk&ndash;pills rolled out on its own pill-tile, divided with a spatula, rolled with
the finger and thumb, dusted with calcined magnesia and delivered in little round
pasteboard pill-boxes. The store is on a corner about which coveys of ragged-plumed,
hilarious children play and become candidates for the cough drops and soothing syrups that
wait for them inside.
Ikey Schoenstein was the night clerk of the Blue Light and the friend of his customers.
Thus it is on the East Side, where the heart of pharmacy is not g1ace. There, as it should be,
the druggist is a counsellor, a confessor, an adviser, an able and willing missionary and
mentor whose learning is respected, whose occult wisdom is venerated and whose medicine
is often poured, untasted, into the gutter. Therefore Ikey&rsquo;s corniform, be-spectacled nose
and narrow, knowledge-bowed figure was well known in the vicinity of the Blue Light, and
his advice and notice were much desired.
Ikey roomed and breakfasted at Mrs. Riddle&rsquo;s two squares away. Mrs. Riddle had a
daughter named Rosy. The circumlocution has been in vain&ndash;you must have guessed it&ndash;Ikeyadored Rosy. She tinctured all his thoughts; she was the compound extract of all that was
chemically pure and officinal&ndash;the dispensatory contained nothing equal to her. But Ikey was
timid, and his hopes remained insoluble in the menstruum of his backwardness and fears.
Behind his counter he was a superior being, calmly conscious of special knowledge and
worth; outside he was a weak-kneed, purblind, motorman-cursed rambler, with ill-fitting
clothes stained with chemicals and smelling of socotrine aloes and valerianate of ammonia.
The fly in Ikey&rsquo;s ointment (thrice welcome, pat trope!) was Chunk McGowan.
Mr. McGowan was also striving to catch the bright smiles tossed about by Rosy. But he
was no outfielder as Ikey was; he picked them off the bat. At the same time he was Ikey&rsquo;s
friend and customer, and often dropped in at the Blue Light Drug Store to have a bruise
painted with iodine or get a cut rubber-plastered after a pleasant evening spent along the
Bowery.
One afternoon McGowan drifted in in his silent, easy way, and sat, comely,
smooth-faced, hard, indomitable, good-natured, upon a stool.
&ldquo;Ikey,&rdquo; said he, when his friend had fetched his mortar and sat opposite, grinding gum
benzoin to a powder, &ldquo;get busy with your ear. It&rsquo;s drugs for me if you&rsquo;ve got the line I need.&rdquo;
Ikey scanned the countenance of Mr. McGowan for the usual evidences of conflict, but
found none.
&ldquo;Take your coat off,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;I guess already that you have been stuck in the ribs
with a knife. I have many times told you those Dagoes would do you up.&rdquo;
Mr. McGowan smiled. &ldquo;Not them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not any Dagoes. But you&rsquo;ve located the
diagnosis all right enough&ndash;it&rsquo;s under my coat, near the ribs. Say! Ikey&ndash;Rosy and me are goin&rsquo;
to run away and get married to-night.&rdquo;
Ikey&rsquo;s left forefinger was doubled over the edge of the mortar, holding it steady. He
gave it a wild rap with the pestle, but felt it not. Meanwhile Mr. McGowan&rsquo;s smile faded to a
look of perplexed gloom.
&ldquo;That is,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;if she keeps in the notion until the time comes. We&rsquo;ve been
layin&rsquo; pipes for the getaway for two weeks. One day she says she will; the same evenin&rsquo; she
says nixy. We&rsquo;ve agreed on to-night, and Rosy&rsquo;s stuck to the affirmative this time for two
whole days. But it&rsquo;s five hours yet till the time, and I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll stand me up when it
comes to the scratch.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You said you wanted drugs,&rdquo; remarked Ikey.Mr. McGowan looked ill at ease and harassed&ndash;a condition opposed to his usual line of
demeanour. He made a patent-medicine almanac into a roll and fitted it with unprofitable
carefulness about his finger.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have this double handicap make a false start to-night for a million,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a little flat up in Harlem all ready, with chrysanthemums on the table and a kettle
ready to boil. And I&rsquo;ve engaged a pulpit pounder to be ready at his house for us at 9.30. It&rsquo;s
got to come off. And if Rosy don&rsquo;t change her mind again!&ldquo;&ndash;Mr. McGowan ceased, a prey to
his doubts.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see then yet,&rdquo; said Ikey, shortly, &ldquo;what makes it that you talk of drugs, or what I
can be doing about it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Old man Riddle don&rsquo;t like me a little bit,&rdquo; went on the uneasy suitor, bent upon
marshalling his arguments. &ldquo;For a week he hasn&rsquo;t let Rosy step outside the door with me. If
it wasn&rsquo;t for losin&rsquo; a boarder they&rsquo;d have bounced me long ago. I&rsquo;m makin&rsquo; $20 a week and
she&rsquo;ll never regret flyin&rsquo; the coop with Chunk McGowan.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You will excuse me, Chunk,&rdquo; said Ikey. &ldquo;I must make a prescription that is to be called
for soon.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said McGowan, looking up suddenly, &ldquo;say, Ikey, ain&rsquo;t there a drug of some
kind&ndash;some kind of powders that&rsquo;11 make a girl like you better if you give &lsquo;em to her?&rdquo;
Ikey&rsquo;s lip beneath his nose curled with the scorn of superior enlightenment; but before
he could answer, McGowan continued:
&ldquo;Tim Lacy told me he got some once from a croaker uptown and fed &lsquo;em to his girl in
soda water. From the very first dose he was ace-high and everybody else looked like thirty
cents to her. They was married in less than two weeks.&rdquo;
Strong and simple was Chunk McGowan. A better reader of men than Ikey was could
have seen that his tough frame was strung upon fine wires. Like a good general who was
about to invade the enemy&rsquo;s territory he was seeking to guard every point against possible
failure.
&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; went on Chunk hopefully, &ldquo;that if I had one of them powders to give Rosy
when I see her at supper to-night it might brace her up and keep her from reneging on the
proposition to skip. I guess she don&rsquo;t need a mule team to drag her away, but women are
better at coaching than they are at running bases. If the stuff&rsquo;ll work just for a couple of
hours it&rsquo;ll do the trick.&rdquo;
&ldquo;When is this foolishness of running away to be happening?&rdquo; asked Ikey.&ldquo;Nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Mr. McGowan. &ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s at seven. At eight Rosy goes to bed with a
headache. At nine old Parvenzano lets me through to his back yard, where there&rsquo;s a board
off Riddle&rsquo;s fence, next door. I go under her window and help her down the fire-escape.
We&rsquo;ve got to make it early on the preacher&rsquo;s account. It&rsquo;s all dead easy if Rosy don&rsquo;t balk
when the flag drops. Can you fix me one of them powders, Ikey?&rdquo;
Ikey Schoenstein rubbed his nose slowly.
&ldquo;Chunk,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is of drugs of that nature that pharmaceutists must have much
carefulness. To you alone of my acquaintance would I intrust a powder like that. But for you I
shall make it, and you shall see how it makes Rosy to think of you.&rdquo;
Ikey went behind the prescription desk. There he crushed to a powder two soluble
tablets, each containing a quarter of a grain of morphia. To them he added a little sugar of
milk to increase the bulk, and folded the mixture neatly in a white paper. Taken by an adult
this powder would insure several hours of heavy slumber without danger to the sleeper. This
he handed to Chunk McGowan, telling him to administer it in a liquid if possible, and
received the hearty thanks of the backyard Lochinvar.
The subtlety of Ikey&rsquo;s action becomes apparent upon recital of his subsequent move.
He sent a messenger for Mr. Riddle and disclosed the plans of Mr. McGowan for eloping with
Rosy. Mr. Riddle was a stout man, brick-dusty of complexion and sudden in action.
&ldquo;Much obliged,&rdquo; he said, briefly, to Ikey. &ldquo;The lazy Irish loafer! My own room&rsquo;s just
above Rosy&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ll just go up there myself after supper and load the shot-gun and wait. If he
comes in my back yard he&rsquo;ll go away in a ambulance instead of a bridal chaise.&rdquo;
With Rosy held in the clutches of Morpheus for a many-hours deep slumber, and the
bloodthirsty parent waiting, armed and forewarned, Ikey felt that his rival was close, indeed,
upon discomfiture.
All night in the Blue Light Drug Store he waited at his duties for chance news of the
tragedy, but none came.
At eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning the day clerk arrived and Ikey started hurriedly for Mrs.
Riddle&rsquo;s to learn the outcome. And, lo! as he stepped out of the store who but Chunk
McGowan sprang from a passing street car and grasped his hand&ndash;Chunk McGowan with a
victor&rsquo;s smile and flushed with joy.
&ldquo;Pulled it off,&rdquo; said Chunk with Elysium in his grin. &ldquo;Rosy bit the fire-escape on time to a
second, and we was under the wire at the Reverend&rsquo;s at 9.3O <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>. She&rsquo;s up at the flat&ndash;she
cooked eggs this mornin&rsquo; in a blue kimono&ndash;Lord! how lucky I am! You must pace up some
day, Ikey, and feed with us. I&rsquo;ve got a job down near the bridge, and that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m heading
for now.&ldquo;&ldquo;The&ndash;the&ndash;powder?&rdquo; stammered Ikey.
&ldquo;Oh, that stuff you gave me!&rdquo; said Chunk, broadening his grin; &ldquo;well, it was this way. I
sat down at the supper table last night at Riddle&rsquo;s, and I looked at Rosy, and I says to myself,
&lsquo;Chunk, if you get the girl get her on the square&ndash;don&rsquo;t try any hocus-pocus with a
thoroughbred like her.&rsquo; And I keeps the paper you give me in my pocket. And then my lamps
fall on another party present, who, I says to myself, is failin&rsquo; in a proper affection toward his
comin&rsquo; son-in- law, so I watches my chance and dumps that powder in old man Riddle&rsquo;s
coffee&ndash;see?&rdquo;
Madame Bo-peep, of the Ranches （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>&ldquo;AUNT ELLEN,&rdquo; said Octavia, cheerfully, as she threw her black kid gloves carefully at
the dignified Persian cat on the window-seat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a pauper.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You are so extreme in your statements, Octavia, dear,&rdquo; said Aunt Ellen, mildly, looking
up from her paper.
&ldquo;If you find yourself temporarily in need of some small change for bonbons, you will
find my purse in the drawer of the writing desk.&rdquo;
Octavia Beaupree removed her hat and seated herself on a footstool near her aunt&rsquo;s
chair, clasping her hands about her knees. Her slim and flexible figure, clad in a modish
mourning costume, accommodated itself easily and gracefully to the trying position. Her
bright and youthful face, with its pair of sparkling, life-enamoured eyes, tried to compose
itself to the seriousness that the occasion seemed to demand.
&ldquo;You good auntie, it isn&rsquo;t a case of bonbons; it is abject, staring, unpicturesque poverty,
with ready-made clothes, gasolined gloves, and probably one o&rsquo;clock dinners all waiting with
the traditional wolf at the door. I&rsquo;ve just come from my lawyer, auntie, and, &lsquo;Please, ma&rsquo;am, I
ain&rsquo;t got nothink &rsquo;t all. Flowers, lady? Buttonhole, gentleman? Pencils, sir, three for five, to
help a poor widow?&rsquo; Do I do it nicely, auntie, or, as a bread-winner accomplishment, were
my lessons in elocution entirely wasted?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do be serious, my dear,&rdquo; said Aunt Ellen, letting her paper fall to the floor, &ldquo;long
enough to tell me what you mean. Colonel Beaupree&rsquo;s estate &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Colonel Beaupree&rsquo;s estate,&rdquo; interrupted Octavia, emphasizing her words with
appropriate dramatic ges- tures, &ldquo;is of Spanish castellar architecture. Colonel Beaupree&rsquo;sresources are &ndash; wind. Colonel Beaupree&rsquo;s stocks are &ndash; water. Colonel Beaupree&rsquo;s income is &ndash;
all in. The statement lacks the legal technicalities to which I have been listening for an hour,
but that is what it means when translated.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Octavia!&rdquo; Aunt Ellen was now visibly possessed by consternation. &ldquo;I can hardly believe
it. And it was the impression that he was worth a million. And the De Peysters themselves
introduced him!&rdquo;
Octavia rippled out a laugh, and then became properly grave.
&ldquo;De mortuis nil, auntie &ndash; not even the rest of it. The dear old colonel &ndash; what a gold
brick he was, after all! I paid for my bargain fairly &ndash; I&rsquo;m all here, am I not? &ndash; items: eyes,
fingers, toes, youth, old family, unques- tionable position in society as called for in the
contract no wild-cat stock here.&rdquo; Octavia picked up the morning paper from the floor. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;m not going to &lsquo;squeal&rsquo; &ndash; isn&rsquo;t that what they call it when you rail at Fortune because
you&rsquo;ve, lost the game?&rdquo; She turned the pages of the paper calmly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Stock market&rsquo; &ndash; no use
for that. &lsquo;Society&rsquo;s doings&rsquo; &ndash; that&rsquo;s done. Here is my page &ndash; the wish column. A Van Dresser
could not be said to &lsquo;want&rsquo; for anything, of course. &lsquo;Chamber- maids, cooks, canvassers,
stenographers-&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; said Aunt Ellen, with a little tremor in her voice, &ldquo;please do not talk in that way.
Even if your affairs are in so unfortunate a condition, there is my three thousand &ndash; &ldquo;
Octavia sprang up lithely, and deposited a smart kiss on the delicate cheek of the prim
little elderly maid.
&ldquo;Blessed auntie, your three thousand is just sufficient to insure your Hyson to be free
from willow leaves and keep the Persian in sterilized cream. I know I&rsquo;d be welcome, but I
prefer to strike bottom like Beelzebub rather than hang around like the Peri listening to the
music from the side entrance. I&rsquo;m going to earn my own living. There&rsquo;s nothing else to do.
I&rsquo;m a &ndash; Oh, oh, oh! &ndash; I had forgotten. There&rsquo;s one thing saved from the wreck. It&rsquo;s a corral &ndash;
no, a ranch in &ndash; let me see &ndash; Texas: an asset, dear old Mr. Bannister called it. How pleased he
was to show me something he could describe as unencumbered! I&rsquo;ve a description of it
among those stupid papers he made me bring away with me from his office. I&rsquo;ll try to find
it.&rdquo;
Octavia found her shopping-bag, and drew from it a long envelope filled with
typewritten documents.
&ldquo;A ranch in Texas,&rdquo; sighed Aunt Ellen. &ldquo;It sounds to me more like a liability than an asset.
Those are the places where the centipedes are found, and cowboys, and fandangos.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;The Rancho de las Sombras,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Octavia from a sheet of violently purple
typewriting &ldquo;&lsquo;is situated one hundred and ten miles southeast of San Antonio, andthirty-eight miles from its nearest railroad station, Nopal, on the I. and G. N. Ranch, consists
of 7,680 acres of well- watered land, with title conferred by State patents, and twenty-two
sections, or 14,080 acres, partly under yearly running lease and partly bought under State&rsquo;s
twenty- year-purchase act. Eight thousand graded merino sheep, with the necessary
equipment of horses, vehicles and general ranch paraphernalia. Ranch-house built of brick,
with six rooms comfortably furnished according to the requirements of the climate. All
within a strong barbed-wire fence.
&ldquo;&lsquo;The present ranch manager seems to be competent and reliable, and is rapidly placing
upon a paying basis a business that, in other hands, had been allowed to suffer from neglect
and misconduct.
&ldquo;&lsquo;This property was secured by Colonel Beaupree in a deal with a Western irrigation
syndicate, and the title to it seems to be perfect. With careful management and the natural
increase of land values, it ought to be made the foundation for a comfortable fortune for its
owner.&lsquo;&rdquo;
When Octavia ceased reading, Aunt Ellen uttered something as near a sniff as her
breeding permitted.
&ldquo;The prospectus,&rdquo; she said, with uncompromising metropolitan suspicion, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t
mention the centipedes, or the Indians. And you never did like mutton, Octavia. I don&rsquo;t see
what advantage you can derive from this &ndash; desert.&rdquo;
But Octavia was in a trance. Her eyes were steadily regarding something quite beyond
their focus. Her lips were parted, and her face was lighted by the kindling furor of the
explorer, the ardent, stirring disquiet of the adventurer. Suddenly she clasped her hands
together exultantly.
&ldquo;The problem solves itself, auntie,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to that ranch. I&rsquo;m going to live
on it. I&rsquo;m going to learn to like mutton, and even concede the good qualities of centipedes &ndash;
at a respectful distance. It&rsquo;s just what I need. It&rsquo;s a new life that comes when my old one is
just ending. It&rsquo;s a release, auntie; it isn&rsquo;t a narrow- ing. Think of the gallops over those
leagues of prairies, with the wind tugging at the roots of your hair, the com- ing close to the
earth and learning over again the stories of the growing grass and the little wild flowers
without names! Glorious is what it will be. Shall I be a shepherdess with a Watteau hat, and
a crook to keep the bad wolves from the lambs, or a typical Western ranch girl, with short
hair, like the pictures of her in the Sunday papers? I think the latter. And they&rsquo;ll have my
picture, too, with the wild-cats I&rsquo;ve slain, single-handed, hanging from my saddle horn. &lsquo;From
the Four Hundred to the Flocks&rsquo; is the way they&rsquo;ll headline it, and they&rsquo;ll print photographs
of the old Van Dresser mansion and the church where I was married. They won&rsquo;t have my
picture, but they&rsquo;ll get an artist to draw it. I&rsquo;ll be wild and woolly, and I&rsquo;ll grow my own
wool.&ldquo;&ldquo;Octavia!&rdquo; Aunt Ellen condensed into the one word all the protests she was unable to
utter.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word, auntie. I&rsquo;m going. I&rsquo;ll see the sky at night fit down on the world like a
big butter-dish cover, and I&rsquo;ll make friends again with the stars that I haven&rsquo;t had a chat with
since I was a wee child. I wish to go. I&rsquo;m tired of all this. I&rsquo;m glad I haven&rsquo;t any money. I could
bless Colonel Beaupree for that ranch, and forgive him for all his bubbles. What if the life will
be rough and lonely! I &ndash; I deserve it. I shut my heart to everything except that miserable
ambition. I &ndash; oh, I wish to go away, and forget &ndash; forget!&rdquo;
Octavia swerved suddenly to her knees, laid her flushed face in her aunt&rsquo;s lap, and
shook with turbulent sobs.
Aunt Ellen bent over her, and smoothed the coppery- brown hair.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said, gently; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know &ndash; that. Who was it, dear?
When Mrs. Octavia Beaupree, née Van Dresser, stepped from the train at Nopal, her
manner lost, for the moment, some of that easy certitude which had always marked her
movements. The town was of recent estab- lishment, and seemed to have been hastily
constructed of undressed lumber and flapping canvas. The element that had congregated
about the station, though not offensively demonstrative, was clearly composed of citizens
accustomed to and prepared for rude alarms.
Octavia stood on the platform, against the telegraph office, and attempted to choose by
intuition from the swaggering, straggling string, of loungers, the manager of the Rancho de
las Sombras, who had been instructed by Mr. Bannister to meet her there. That tall, serious,
looking, elderly man in the blue flannel shirt and white tie she thought must be he. But, no;
he passed by, removing his gaze from the lady as hers rested on him, according to the
Southern custom. The manager, she thought, with some impatience at being kept waiting,
should have no difficulty in selecting her. Young women wearing the most recent thing in
ash-coloured travelling suits were not so plentiful in Nopal!
Thus keeping a speculative watch on all persons of possible managerial aspect, Octavia,
with a catching breath and a start of surprise, suddenly became aware of Teddy Westlake
hurrying along the platform in the direction of the train &ndash; of Teddy Westlake or his sunbrowned ghost in cheviot, boots and leather-girdled hat &ndash; Theodore Westlake, Jr., amateur
polo (almost) champion, all-round butterfly and cumberer of the soil; but a broader, surer,
more emphasized and determined Teddy than the one she had known a year ago when last
she saw him.
He perceived Octavia at almost the same time, deflected his course, and steered for her
in his old, straightforward way. Something like awe came upon her as the strange- ness of his
metamorphosis was brought into closer range; the rich, red-brown of his complexionbrought out so vividly his straw-coloured mustache and steel-gray eyes. He seemed more
grown-up, and, somehow, farther away. But, when he spoke, the old, boyish Teddy came
back again. They had been friends from childhood.
&ldquo;Why, &lsquo;Tave!&rdquo; he exclaimed, unable to reduce his perplexity to coherence. &ldquo; How &ndash;
what &ndash; when &ndash; where?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Train,&rdquo; said Octavia; &ldquo;necessity; ten minutes ago; home. Your complexion&rsquo;s gone, Teddy.
Now, how &ndash; what &ndash; when &ndash; where?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working down here,&rdquo; said Teddy. He cast side glances about the station as one
does who tries to combine politeness with duty.
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t notice on the train,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;an old lady with gray curls and a poodle,
who occupied two seats with her bundles and quarrelled with the conductor, did you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; answered Octavia, reflecting. &ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t, by any chance, noticed a
big, gray-mustached man in a blue shirt and six-shooters, with little flakes of merino wool
sticking in his hair, have you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lots of &lsquo;em,&rdquo; said Teddy, with symptoms of mental delirium under the strain. Do you
happen to know any such individual?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No; the description is imaginary. Is your interest in the old lady whom you describe a
personal one?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Never saw her in my life. She&rsquo;s painted entirely from fancy. She owns the little piece of
property where I earn my bread and butter - the Rancho de las Sombras. I drove up to meet
her according to arrangement with her lawyer.&rdquo;
Octavia leaned against the wall of the telegraph office. Was this possible? And didn&rsquo;t he
know?
&ldquo;Are you the manager of that ranch?&rdquo; she asked weakly.
&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Teddy, with pride.
&ldquo;I am Mrs. Beaupree,&rdquo; said Octavia faintly; &ldquo;but my hair never would curl, and I was
polite to the conductor.&rdquo;
For a moment that strange, grown-up look came back, and removed Teddy miles away
from her.&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse me,&rdquo; he said, rather awkwardly. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;ve been down here in
the chaparral a year. I hadn&rsquo;t heard. Give me your checks, please, and I&rsquo;ll have your traps
loaded into the wagon. José will follow with them. We travel ahead in the buckboard.&rdquo;
Seated by Teddy in a feather-weight buckboard, behind a pair of wild, cream-coloured
Spanish ponies, Octavia abandoned all thought for the exhilaration of the present. They
swept out of the little town and down the level road toward the south. Soon the road
dwindled and dis- appeared, and they struck across a world carpeted with an endless reach
of curly mesquite grass. The wheels made no sound. The tireless ponies bounded ahead at
an unbroken gallop. The temperate wind, made fragrant by thousands of acres of blue and
yellow wild flowers, roared gloriously in their ears. The motion was a?rial, ecstatic, with a
thrilling sense of perpetuity in its effect. Octavia sat silent, possessed by a feeling of
elemental, sensual bliss. Teddy seemed to be wrestling with some internal problem.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to call you madama,&rdquo; he announced as the result of his labours. &ldquo;That is
what the Mexicans will call you &ndash; they&rsquo;re nearly all Mexicans on the ranch, you know. That
seems to me about the proper thing.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Westlake,&rdquo; said Octavia, primly.
&ldquo;Oh, now,&rdquo; said Teddy, in some consternation, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s carrying the thing too far, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry me with your beastly etiquette. I&rsquo;m just beginning to live. Don&rsquo;t remind
me of anything artificial. If only this air could be bottled! This much alone is worth coming
for. Oh, look I there goes a deer!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Jack-rabbit,&rdquo; said Teddy, without turning his head.
&ldquo;Could I &ndash; might I drive?&rdquo; suggested Octavia, pant- ing, with rose-tinted cheeks and the
eye of an eager child.
&ldquo;On one condition. Could I &ndash; might I smoke? &ldquo;
&ldquo;Forever!&rdquo; cried Octavia, taking the lines with solemn joy. &ldquo;How shall I know which way
to drive?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Keep her sou&rsquo; by sou&rsquo;east, and all sail set. You see that black speck on the horizon
under that lowermost Gulf cloud? That&rsquo;s a group of live-oaks and a land- mark. Steer
halfway between that and the little hill to the left. I&rsquo;ll recite you the whole code of driving
rules for the Texas prairies: keep the reins from under the horses&rsquo; feet, and swear at &lsquo;em
frequent.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too happy to swear, Ted. Oh, why do people buy yachts or travel in palace-cars,
when a buckboard and a pair of plugs and a spring morning like this can satisfy all desire?&ldquo;&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll ask you,&rdquo; protested Teddy, who was futilely striking match after match on the
dashboard, &ldquo;not to call those denizens of the air plugs. They can kick out a hundred miles
between daylight and dark.&rdquo; At last he succeeded in snatching a light for his cigar from the
flame held in the hollow of his hands.
&ldquo;Room!&rdquo; said Octavia, intensely. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what produces the effect. I know now what I&rsquo;ve
wanted &ndash; scope &ndash; range &ndash; room! &ldquo;
&ldquo;Smoking-room,&rdquo; said Teddy, unsentimentally. &ldquo;I love to smoke in a buckboard. The
wind blows the smoke into you and out again. It saves exertion.&rdquo;
The two fell so naturally into their old-time goodfellow- ship that it was only by degrees
that a sense of the strange- ness of the new relations between them came to be felt.
&ldquo;Madama,&rdquo; said Teddy, wonderingly, &ldquo;however did you get it into your bead to cut the
crowd and come down here? Is it a fad now among the upper classes to trot off to sheep
ranches instead of to Newport?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I was broke, Teddy,&rdquo; said Octavia, sweetly, with her interest centred upon steering
safely between a Spanish dagger plant and a clump of chaparral; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a thing in the
world but this ranch &ndash; not even any other home to go to.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Come, now,&rdquo; said Teddy, anxiously but ineredu- lously, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;When my husband,&rdquo; said Octavia, with a shy slurring of the word, &ldquo;died three months
ago I thought I had a reasonable amount of the world&rsquo;s goods. His lawyer exploded that
theory in a sixty-minute fully illustrated lecture. I took to the sheep as a last resort. Do you
happen to know of any fashionable caprice among the gilded youth of Manhattan that
induces them to abandon polo and club windows to become managers of sheep ranches?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easily explained in my case,&rdquo; responded Teddy, promptly. &ldquo;I had to go to work. I
couldn&rsquo;t have earned my board in New York, so I chummed a while with old Sandford, one of
the syndicate that owned the ranch before Colonel Beaupree bought it, and got a place
down here. I wasn&rsquo;t manager at first. I jogged around on ponies and studied the business in
detail, until I got all the points in my head. I saw where it was losing and what the reme- dies
were, and then Sandford put me in charge. I get a hundred dollars a month, and I earn it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Poor Teddy!&rdquo; said Octavia, with a smile.
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t. I like it. I save half my wages, and I&rsquo;m as hard as a water plug. It beats
polo.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Will it furnish bread and tea and jam for another out- cast from civilization?&rdquo;&ldquo;The spring shearing,&rdquo; said the manager, &ldquo;just cleaned up a deficit in last year&rsquo;s business.
Wastefulness and inattention have been the rule heretofore. The autumn clip will leave a
small profit over all expenses. Next year there will be jam.&rdquo;
When, about four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, the ponies rounded a gentle, brush-covered
hill, and then swooped, like a double cream-coloured cyclone, upon the Rancho de las
Sombras, Octavia gave a little cry of delight. A lordly grove of magnificent live-oaks cast an
area of grateful, cool shade, whence the ranch had drawn its name, &ldquo;de las Sombras&rdquo; &ndash; of
the shadows. The house, of red brick, one story, ran low and long beneath the trees.
Through its middle, dividing its six rooms in half, extended a broad, arched passageway,
picturesque with flowering cactus and hanging red earthern jars. A &ldquo;gallery,&rdquo; low and broad,
encircled the building. Vines climbed about it, and the adjacent ground was, for a space,
covered with transplanted grass and shrubs. A little lake, long and narrow, glimmered in the
sun at the rear. Further away stood the shacks of the Mexican workers, the corrals, wool
sheds and shearing pens. To the right lay the low hills, splattered with dark patches of
chaparral; to the left the unbounded green prairie blending against the blue heavens.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a home, Teddy,&rdquo; said Octavia, breathlessly; that&rsquo;s what it is &ndash; it&rsquo;s a home.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not so bad for a sheep ranch,&rdquo; admitted Teddy, with excusable pride. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
tinkering on it at odd times.&rdquo;
A Mexican youth sprang from somewhere in the grass, and took charge of the creams.
The mistress and the manager entered the house.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Mrs. MacIntyre,&rdquo; said Teddy, as a placid, neat, elderly lady came out upon the
gallery to meet them. &ldquo;Mrs. Mac, here&rsquo;s the boss. Very likely she will be wanting a hunk of
ham and a dish of beans after her drive.&rdquo;
Mrs. MacIntyre, the housekeeper, as much a fixture on the place as the lake or the
live-oaks, received the imputation of the ranch&rsquo;s resources of refreshment with mild
indignation, and was about to give it utterance when Octavia spoke.
&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. MacIntyre, don&rsquo;t apologize for Teddy. Yes, I call him Teddy. So does every one
whom he hasn&rsquo;t duped into taking him seriously. You see, we used to cut paper dolls and
play jackstraws together ages ago. No one minds what he says.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Teddy, &ldquo;no one minds what he says, just so he doesn&rsquo;t do it again.&rdquo;
Octavia cast one of those subtle, sidelong glances toward him from beneath her
lowered eyelids &ndash; a glance that Teddy used to describe as an upper-cut. But there was
nothing in his ingenuous, weather-tanned face to warrant a suspicion that he was making an
allusion &ndash; nothing. Beyond a doubt, thought Octavia, he had forgotten.&ldquo;Mr. Westlake likes his fun,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maclntyre, as she conducted Octavia to her
rooms. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added, loyally, &ldquo;people around here usually pay attention to what he says
when he talks in earnest. I don&rsquo;t know what would have become of this place without him.&rdquo;
Two rooms at the east end of the house had been arranged for the occupancy of the
ranch&rsquo;s mistress. When she entered them a slight dismay seized her at their bare appearance
and the scantiness of their furniture; but she quickly reflected that the climate was a
semi-tropical one, and was moved to appreciation of the well-conceived efforts to conform
to it. The sashes had already been removed from the big windows, and white curtains waved
in the Gulf breeze that streamed through the wide jalousies. The bare floor was amply
strewn with cool rugs; the chairs were inviting, deep, dreamy willows; the walls were
papered with a light, cheerful olive. One whole side of her sitting room was covered with
books on smooth, unpainted pine shelves. She flew to these at once. Before her was a
well-selected library. She caught glimpses of titles of volumes of fiction and travel not yet
seasoned from the dampness of the press.
Presently, recollecting that she was now in a wilderness given over to mutton,
centipedes and privations, the incongruity of these luxuries struck her, and, with intuitive
feminine suspicion, she began turning to the fly-leaves of volume after volume. Upon each
one was inscribed in fluent characters the name of Theodore Westlake, Jr.
Octavia, fatigued by her long journey, retired early that night. Lying upon her white,
cool bed, she rested deliciously, but sleep coquetted long with her. She listened to faint
noises whose strangeness kept her faculties on the alert &ndash; the fractious yelping of the
coyotes, the ceaseless, low symphony of the wind, the distant booming of the frogs about
the lake, the lamentation of a concertina in the Mexicans&rsquo; quarters. There were many
conflicting feelings in her heart &ndash; thankfulness and rebellion, peace and disquietude,
loneliness and a sense of protecting care, happiness and an old, haunting pain.
She did what any other woman would have done &ndash; sought relief in a wholesome tide of
unreasonable tears, and her last words, murmured to herself before slumber, capitulating,
came softly to woo her, were &ldquo;He has forgotten.&rdquo;
The manager of the Rancho de las Sombras was no dilettante. He was a &ldquo;hustler.&rdquo; He
was generally up, mounted, and away of mornings before the rest of the household were
awake, making the rounds of the flocks and camps. This was the duty of the majordomo, a
stately old Mexican with a princely air and manner, but Teddy seemed to have a great deal of
confidence in his own eyesight. Except in the busy seasons, he nearly always returned to the
ranch to breakfast at eight o&rsquo;clock, with Octavia and Mrs. Maclntyre, at the little table set in
the central hallway, bringing with him a tonic and breezy cheerfulness full of the health and
flavour of the prairies.A few days after Octavia&rsquo;s arrival he made her get out one of her riding skirts, and
curtail it to a shortness demanded by the chaparral brakes.
With some misgivings she donned this and the pair of buckskin leggings he prescribed
in addition, and, mounted upon a dancing pony, rode with him to view her posses- sions. He
showed her everything &ndash; the flocks of ewes, muttons and grazing lambs, the dipping vats,
the shearing pens, the uncouth merino rams in their little pasture, the water-tanks I
prepared against the summer drought &ndash; giving account of his stewardship with a boyish
enthus- siasm that never flagged.
Where was the old Teddy that she knew so well? This side of him was the same, and it
was a side that pleased her; but this was all she ever saw of him now. Where was his
sentimentality &ndash; those old, varying moods of impetuous love-making, of fanciful, quixotic
devotion, of heart-breaking gloom, of alternating, absurd tenderness and haughty dignity?
His nature had been a sensitive one, his temperament bordering closely on the artistic. She
knew that, besides being a follower of fashion and its fads and sports, he had cultivated
tastes of a finer nature. He had written things, he had tampered with colours, he was
something of a student in certain branches of art, and once she had been admitted to all his
aspirations and thoughts. But now &ndash; and she could not avoid the con- clusion &ndash; Teddy had
barricaded against her every side of himself except one &ndash; the side that showed the manager
of the Rancho de las Sombras and a jolly chum who had forgiven and forgotten. Queerly
enough the words of Mr. Bannister&rsquo;s description of her property came into her mind &ndash; &ldquo;all
inclosed within a strong barbed-wire fence.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Teddy&rsquo;s fenced, too,&rdquo; said Octavia to herself.
It was not difficult for her to reason out the cause of his fortifications. It had originated
one night at the Hammersmiths&rsquo; ball. It occurred at a time soon after she had decided to
accept Colonel Beaupree and his million, which was no more than her looks and the entrée
she held to the inner circles were worth. Teddy had proposed with all his impetuosity and
fire, and she looked him straight in the eyes, an said, coldly and finally: &ldquo;Never let me hear
any such silly nonsense from you again.&rdquo; &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Teddy, with an expression around
his mouth, and &ndash; now Teddy was inclosed within a strong barbed-wire fence.
It was on this first ride of inspection that Teddy was seized by the inspiration that
suggested the name of Mother Goose&rsquo;s heroine, and he at once bestowed it upon Octavia.
The idea, supported by both a similarity of names and identity of occupations, seemed to
strike him as a peculiarly happy one, and he never tired of using it. The Mexicans on the
ranch also took up the name, adding another syllable to accommodate their lingual
incapacity for the final &ldquo;p,&rdquo; gravely referring to her as &ldquo;La Madama Bo-Peepy.&rdquo; Eventually it
spread, and &ldquo;Madame Bo- Peep&rsquo;s ranch&rdquo; was as often mentioned as the &ldquo;Rancho de las
Sombras.&ldquo;Came the long, hot season from May to September, when work is scarce on the ranches.
Octavia passed the days in a kind of lotus-eater&rsquo;s dream. Books, hammocks, correspondence
with a few intimate friends, a renewed interest in her old water-colour box and easel &ndash; these
disposed of the sultry hours of daylight. The evenings were always sure to bring enjoyment.
Best of all were the rapturous horseback rides with Teddy, when the moon gave light over
the wind-swept leagues, chaperoned by the wheeling night-hawk and the startled owl. Often
the Mexicans would come up from their shacks with their guitars and sing the weirdest of
heart-breaking songs. There were long, cosy chats on the breezy gallery, and an interminable
warfare of wits between Teddy and Mrs. MacIntyre, whose abundant Scotch shrewdness
often more than overmatched the lighter humour in which she was lacking.
And the nights came, one after another, and were filed away by weeks and months &ndash;
nights soft and languorous and fragrant, that should have driven Strephon to Chloe over
wires however barbed, that might have drawn Cupid himself to hunt, lasso in hand, among
those amorous pastures &ndash; but Teddy kept his fences up.
One July night Madame Bo-Peep and her ranch man- ager were sitting on the east
gallerv. Teddy had been exhausting the science of prognostication as to the proba- bilities of
a price of twenty-four cents for the autumn clip, and had then subsided into an anesthetic
cloud of Havana smoke. Only as incompetent a judge as a woman would have failed to note
long ago that at least a third of his salary must have gone up in the fumes of those imported
Regalias.
&ldquo;Teddy,&rdquo; said Octavia, suddenly, and rather sharply, &ldquo;what are you working down here
on a ranch for?&rdquo;
&ldquo;One hundred per,&rdquo; said Teddy, glibly, &ldquo;and found.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to discharge you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Teddy, with a grin.
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Octavia, with argumentative heat.
&ldquo;Under contract. Terms of sale respect all unexpired contracts. Mine runs until 12 P. m.,
December thirty-first. You might get up at midnight on that date and fire me. if you try it
sooner I&rsquo;ll be in a position to bring legal proceedings.&rdquo;
Octavia seemed to be considering the prospects of litigation.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Teddy cheerfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been think- ing of resigning anyway.&rdquo;
Octavia&rsquo;s rocking-chair ceased its motion. There were centipedes in this country, she
felt sure; and Indians, and vast, lonely, desolate, empty wastes; all within strong barbed-wirefence. There was a Van Dresser pride, but there was also a Van Dresser heart. She must
know for certain whether or not he had forgotten.
&ldquo;Ah, well, Teddy,&rdquo; she said, with a fine assumption of polite interest, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s lonely down
here; you&rsquo;re longing to get back to the old life &ndash; to polo and lobsters and theatres and balls.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Never cared much for balls,&rdquo; said Teddy virtuously.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting old, Teddy. Your memory is failing. Nobody ever knew you to miss a
dance, unless it occurred on the same night with another one which you attended. And you
showed such shocking bad taste, too, in dancing too often with the same partner. Let me see,
what was that Forbes girl&rsquo;s name &ndash; the one with wall eyes &ndash; Mabel, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No; Adéle. Mabel was the one with the bony elbows. That wasn&rsquo;t wall in Adéle&rsquo;s eyes.
It was soul. We used to talk sonnets together, and Verlaine. Just then I was trying to run a
pipe from the Pierian spring.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You were on the floor with her,&rdquo; said Octavia, unde- flected, &ldquo;five times at the
Hammersmiths&rsquo;.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hammersmiths&rsquo; what? &rdquo; questioned Teddy, vacuously.
&ldquo;Ball &ndash; ball,&rdquo; said Octavia, viciously. &ldquo;What were we talking of?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Eyes, I thought,&rdquo; said Teddy, after some reflection; &ldquo;and elbows.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Those Hammersmiths,&rdquo; went on Octavia, in her sweetest society prattle, after
subduing an intense desire to yank a handful of sunburnt, sandy hair from the head lying
back contentedly against the canvas of the steamer chair, &ldquo;had too much money. Mines,
wasn&rsquo;t it? It was something that paid something to the ton. You couldn&rsquo;t get a glass of plain
water in their house. Everything at that ball was dreadfully overdone.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said Teddy.
&ldquo;Such a crowd there was!&rdquo; Octavia continued, con- scious that she was talking the rapid
drivel of a school- girl describing her first dance. &ldquo;The balconies were as warm as the rooms.
I &ndash; lost &ndash; something at that ball.&rdquo; The last sentence was uttered in a tone calculated to
remove the barbs from miles of wire.
&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; confessed Teddy, in a lower voice.
&ldquo;A glove,&rdquo; said Octavia, falling back as the enemy approached her ditches.&ldquo;Caste,&rdquo; said Teddy, halting his firing line without loss. &ldquo;I hobnobbed, half the evening
with one of Hammersmith&rsquo;s miners, a fellow who kept his hands in his pockets, and talked
like an archangel about reduction plants and drifts and levels and sluice-boxes.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A pearl-gray glove, nearly new,&rdquo; sighed Octavia, mournfully.
&ldquo;A bang-up chap, that McArdle,&rdquo; maintained Teddy approvingly. &ldquo; A man who hated
olives and elevators; a man who handled mountains as croquettes, and built tunnels in the
air; a man who never uttered a word of silly nonsense in his life. Did you sign those leaserenewal applications yet, madama? They&rsquo;ve got to be on file in the land office by the
thirty-first.&rdquo;
Teddy turned his head lazily. Octavia&rsquo;s chair was vacant.
A certain centipede, crawling along the lines marked out by fate, expounded the
situation. It was early one morning while Octavia and Mrs. Maclntyre were trim- ming the
honeysuckle on the west gallery. Teddy had risen and departed hastily before daylight in
response to word that a flock of ewes had been scattered from their bedding ground during
the night by a thunder-storm.
The centipede, driven by destiny, showed himself on the floor of the gallery, and then,
the screeches of the two women giving him his cue, he scuttled with all his yellow legs
through the open door into the furthermost west room, which was Teddy&rsquo;s. Arming
themselves with domestic utensils selected with regard to their length, Octavia and Mrs.
Maclntyre, with much clutching of skirts and skirmishing for the position of rear guard in the
attacking force, followed.
Once outside, the centipede seemed to have disappeared, and his prospective
murderers began a thorough but cautious search for their victim.
Even in the midst of such a dangerous and absorbing adventure Octavia was conscious
of an awed curiosity on finding herself in Teddy&rsquo;s sanctum. In that room he sat alone, silently
communing with those secret thoughts that he now shared with no one, dreamed there
whatever dreams he now called on no one to interpret.
It was the room of a Spartan or a soldier. In one corner stood a wide, canvas-covered
cot; in another, a small bookcase; in another, a grim stand of Winchesters and shotguns. An
immense table, strewn with letters, papers and documents and surmounted by a set of
pigeon- holes, occupied one side.
The centipede showed genius in concealing himself in such bare quarters. Mrs.
Maclntyre was poking a broom-handle behind the bookcase. Octavia approached Teddy&rsquo;s cot.
The room was just as the manager had left it in his hurry. The Mexican maid had not yet
given it her attention. There was his big pillow with the imprint of his head still in the centre.She thought the horrid beast might have climbed the cot and hidden itself to bite Teddy.
Centipedes were thus cruel and vindictive toward managers.
She cautiously overturned the pillow, and then parted her lips to give the signal for
reinforcements at sight of a long, slender, dark object lying there. But, repressing it in time,
she caught up a glove, a pearl-gray glove, flattened &ndash; it might be conceived &ndash; by many, many
months of nightly pressure beneath the pillow of the man who had forgotten the
Hammersmiths&rsquo; ball. Teddy must have left so hurriedly that morning that he had, for once,
forgotten to transfer it to its resting-place by day. Even managers, who are notoriously wily
and cunning, are sometimes caught up with.
Octavia slid the gray glove into the bosom of her sum- mery morning gown. It was hers.
Men who put them- selves within a strong barbed-wire fence, and remember Hammersmith
balls only by the talk of miners about sluice- boxes, should not be allowed to possess such
articles.
After all, what a paradise this prairie country was! How it blossomed like the rose when
you found things that were thought to be lost! How delicious was that morning breeze
coming in the windows, fresh and sweet with the breath of the yellow ratama blooms!
Might one not stand, for a minute, with shining, far-gazing eyes, and dream that mistakes
might be corrected?
Why was Mrs. Maclntyre poking about so absurdly with a broom?
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it,&rdquo; said Mrs. MacIntyre, banging the door. &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Did you lose something? asked Octavia, with sweetly polite non-interest.
&ldquo;The little devil!&rdquo; said Mrs. Maclntyre, driven to violence. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve no forgotten him
alretty?&rdquo;
Between them they slew the centipede. Thus was he rewarded for his agency toward
the recovery of things lost at the Hammersmiths&rsquo; ball.
It seems that Teddy, in due course, remembered the glove, and when he returned to
the house at sunset made a secret but exhaustive search for it. Not until evening, upon the
moonlit eastern gallery, did he find it. It was upon the hand that he had thought lost to him
forever, and so he was moved to repeat certain nonsense that he had been commanded
never, never to utter again. Teddy&rsquo;s fences were down.
This time there was no ambition to stand in the way, and the wooing was as natural and
successful as should be between ardent shepherd and gentle shepherdess.The prairies changed to a garden. The Rancho de las Sombras became the Ranch of
Light.
A few days later Octavia received a letter from Mr. Bannister, in reply to one she had
written to him asking some questions about her business. A portion of the letter ran as
follows:
&ldquo;I am at a loss to account for your references to the sheep ranch. Two months after
your departure to take up your residence upon it, it was discovered that Colonel Beaupree&rsquo;s
title was worthless. A deed came to light showing that he disposed of the property before
his death. The matter was reported to your manager, Mr. Westlake, who at once repurchad
the property. It is entirely beyond my powers of conjecture to imagine how you have
remained in ignorance of this fact. I beg you that will at once confer with that gentleman,
who will, at least, corroborate my statement.&rdquo;
Octavia sought Teddy, with battle in her eye.
&ldquo;What are you working on this ranch for?&rdquo; she asked once more.
&ldquo;One hundred &ndash; &rdquo; he began to repeat, but saw in her face that she knew. She held Mr.
Bannister&rsquo;s letter in her hand. He knew that the game was up.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my ranch,&rdquo; said Teddy, like a schoolboy detected in evil. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mighty poor
manager that isn&rsquo;t able to absorb the boss&rsquo;s business if you give him time.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why were you working down here?&rdquo; pursued Octavia still struggling after the key to
the riddle of Teddy.
&ldquo;To tell the truth, &lsquo;Tave,&rdquo; said Teddy, with quiet candour, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t for the salary. That
about kept me in cigars and sunburn lotions. I was sent south by my doctor. &lsquo;Twas that right
lung that was going to the bad on account of over-exercise and strain at polo and gymnastics. I needed climate and ozone and rest and things of that sort.&rdquo;
In an instant Octavia was close against the vicinity of the affected organ. Mr. Bannister&rsquo;s
letter fluttered to the floor.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s &ndash; it&rsquo;s well now, isn&rsquo;t it, Teddy?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sound as a mesquite chunk. I deceived you in one thing. I paid fifty thousand for your
ranch as soon as I found you had no title. I had just about that much income accumulated at
my banker&rsquo;s while I&rsquo;ve been herding sheep down here, so it was almost like picking the thing
up on a bargain-counter for a penny. There&rsquo;s another little surplus of unearned increment
piling up there, &lsquo;Tave. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of a wedding trip in a yacht with white ribbons tiedto the mast, through the Mediterranean, and then up among the Hebrides and down
Norway to the Zuyder Zee.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And I was thinking,&rdquo; said Octavia, softly, &ldquo;of a wedding gallop with my manager among
the flocks of sheep and back to a wedding breakfast with Mrs. Mae- Intyre on the gallery,
with, maybe, a sprig of orange blossom fastened to the red jar above the table.&rdquo;
Teddy laughed, and began to chant:
&ldquo;Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep,
And doesn&rsquo;t know where to find &lsquo;em.
Let &lsquo;em alone, and they&rsquo;ll come home,
And &ndash; &ldquo;
Octavia drew his head down, and whispered in his ear, But that is one of the tales they
brought behind them.
Mammon and the Archer （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Old Anthony Rockwall, retired manufacturer and proprietor of Rockwall&rsquo;s Eureka Soap,
looked out the library window of his Fifth Avenue mansion and grinned. His neighbour to
the right&ndash;the aristocratic clubman, G. Van Schuylight Suffolk-Jones&ndash;came out to his waiting
motor-car, wrinkling a contumelious nostril, as usual, at the Italian renaissance sculpture of
the soap palace&rsquo;s front elevation.
&ldquo;Stuck-up old statuette of nothing doing!&rdquo; commented the ex-Soap King. &ldquo;The Eden
Musee&rsquo;ll get that old frozen Nesselrode yet if he don&rsquo;t watch out. I&rsquo;ll have this house painted
red, white, and blue next summer and see if that&rsquo;ll make his Dutch nose turn up any higher.&rdquo;
And then Anthony Rockwall, who never cared for bells, went to the door of his library
and shouted &ldquo;Mike!&rdquo; in the same voice that had once chipped off pieces of the welkin on the
Kansas prairies.
&ldquo;Tell my son,&rdquo; said Anthony to the answering menial, &ldquo;to come in here before he leaves
the house.&rdquo;
When young Rockwall entered the library the old man laid aside his newspaper, looked
at him with a kindly grimness on his big, smooth, ruddy countenance, rumpled his mop of
white hair with one hand and rattled the keys in his pocket with the other.
&ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; said Anthony Rockwail, &ldquo;what do you pay for the soap that you use?&ldquo;Richard, only six months home from college, was startled a little. He had not yet taken
the measure of this sire of his, who was as full of unexpectednesses as a girl at her first party.
&ldquo;Six dollars a dozen, I think, dad.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And your clothes?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I suppose about sixty dollars, as a rule.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a gentleman,&rdquo; said Anthony, decidedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of these young bloods
spending $24 a dozen for soap, and going over the hundred mark for clothes. You&rsquo;ve got as
much money to waste as any of &lsquo;em, and yet you stick to what&rsquo;s decent and moderate. Now
I use the old Eureka&ndash;not only for sentiment, but it&rsquo;s the purest soap made. Whenever you
pay more than 10 cents a cake for soap you buy bad perfumes and labels. But 50 cents is
doing very well for a young man in your generation, position and condition. As I said, you&rsquo;re
a gentleman. They say it takes three generations to make one. They&rsquo;re off. Money&rsquo;ll do it as
slick as soap grease. It&rsquo;s made you one. By hokey! it&rsquo;s almost made one of me. I&rsquo;m nearly as
impolite and disagreeable and ill-mannered as these two old Knickerbocker gents on each
side of me that can&rsquo;t sleep of nights because I bought in between &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There are some things that money can&rsquo;t accomplish,&rdquo; remarked young Rockwall,
rather gloomily.
&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; said old Anthony, shocked. &ldquo;I bet my money on money every
time. I&rsquo;ve been through the encyclopaedia down to Y looking for something you can&rsquo;t buy
with it; and I expect to have to take up the appendix next week. I&rsquo;m for money against the
field. Tell me something money won&rsquo;t buy.&rdquo;
&ldquo;For one thing,&rdquo; answered Richard, rankling a little, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t buy one into the exclusive
circles of society.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oho! won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; thundered the champion of the root of evil. &ldquo;You tell me
where your exclusive circles would be if the first Astor hadn&rsquo;t had the money to pay for his
steerage passage over?&rdquo;
Richard sighed.
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what I was coming to,&rdquo; said the old man, less boisterously. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I
asked you to come in. There&rsquo;s something going wrong with you, boy. I&rsquo;ve been noticing it for
two weeks. Out with it. I guess I could lay my hands on eleven millions within twenty-four
hours, besides the real estate. If it&rsquo;s your liver, there&rsquo;s the Rambler down in the bay, coaled,
and ready to steam down to the Bahamas in two days.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not a bad guess, dad; you haven&rsquo;t missed it far.&rdquo;&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Anthony, keenly; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;
Richard began to walk up and down the library floor. There was enough comradeship
and sympathy in this crude old father of his to draw his confidence.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask her?&rdquo; demanded old Anthony. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll jump at you. You&rsquo;ve got the
money and the looks, and you&rsquo;re a decent boy. Your hands are clean. You&rsquo;ve got no Eureka
soap on &lsquo;em. You&rsquo;ve been to college, but she&rsquo;ll overlook that.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had a chance,&rdquo; said Richard.
&ldquo;Make one,&rdquo; said Anthony. &ldquo;Take her for a walk in the park, or a straw ride, or walk
home with her from church Chance! Pshaw!&rdquo;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the social mill, dad. She&rsquo;s part of the stream that turns it. Every hour
and minute of her time is arranged for days in advance. I must have that girl, dad, or this
town is a blackjack swamp forevermore. And I can&rsquo;t write it&ndash;I can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that with all the money I&rsquo;ve got you
can&rsquo;t get an hour or two of a girl&rsquo;s time for yourself?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put it off too late. She&rsquo;s going to sail for Europe at noon day after to-morrow for a
two years&rsquo; stay. I&rsquo;m to see her alone to-morrow evening for a few minutes. She&rsquo;s at
Larchmont now at her aunt&rsquo;s. I can&rsquo;t go there. But I&rsquo;m allowed to meet her with a cab at the
Grand Central Station to-morrow evening at the 8.30 train. We drive down Broadway to
Wallack&rsquo;s at a gallop, where her mother and a box party will be waiting for us in the lobby.
Do you think she would listen to a declaration from me during that six or eight minutes
under those circumstances? No. And what chance would I have in the theatre or afterward?
None. No, dad, this is one tangle that your money can&rsquo;t unravel. We can&rsquo;t buy one minute of
time with cash; if we could, rich people would live longer. There&rsquo;s no hope of getting a talk
with Miss Lantry before she sails.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right, Richard, my boy,&rdquo; said old Anthony, cheerfully. &ldquo;You may run along down to
your club now. I&rsquo;m glad it ain&rsquo;t your liver. But don&rsquo;t forget to burn a few punk sticks in the
joss house to the great god Mazuma from time to time. You say money won&rsquo;t buy time? Well,
of course, you can&rsquo;t order eternity wrapped up and delivered at your residence for a price,
but I&rsquo;ve seen Father Time get pretty bad stone bruises on his heels when he walked through
the gold diggings.&rdquo;
That night came Aunt Ellen, gentle, sentimental, wrinkled, sighing, oppressed by wealth,
in to Brother Anthony at his evening paper, and began discourse on the subject of lovers&rsquo;
woes.&ldquo;He told me all about it,&rdquo; said brother Anthony, yawning. &ldquo;I told him my bank account
was at his service. And then he began to knock money. Said money couldn&rsquo;t help. Said the
rules of society couldn&rsquo;t be bucked for a yard by a team of ten-millionaires.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, Anthony,&rdquo; sighed Aunt Ellen, &ldquo;I wish you would not think so much of money.
Wealth is nothing where a true affection is concerned. Love is all-powerful. If he only had
spoken earlier! She could not have refused our Richard. But now I fear it is too late. He will
have no opportunity to address her. All your gold cannot bring happiness to your son.&rdquo;
At eight o&rsquo;clock the next evening Aunt Ellen took a quaint old gold ring from a
moth-eaten case and gave it to Richard.
&ldquo;Wear it to-night, nephew,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Your mother gave it to me. Good luck in love
she said it brought. She asked me to give it to you when you had found the one you loved.&rdquo;
Young Rockwall took the ring reverently and tried it on his smallest finger. It slipped as
far as the second joint and stopped. He took it off and stuffed it into his vest pocket, after
the manner of man. And then he &lsquo;phoned for his cab.
At the station he captured Miss Lantry out of the gadding mob at eight thirty-two.
&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t keep mamma and the others waiting,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;To Wallack&rsquo;s Theatre as fast as you can drive!&rdquo; said Richard loyally.
They whirled up Forty-second to Broadway, and then down the white- starred lane that
leads from the soft meadows of sunset to the rocky hills of morning.
At Thirty-fourth Street young Richard quickly thrust up the trap and ordered the
cabman to stop.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve dropped a ring,&rdquo; he apologised, as he climbed out. &ldquo;It was my mother&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;d
hate to lose it. I won&rsquo;t detain you a minute&ndash;I saw where it fell.&rdquo;
In less than a minute he was back in the cab with the ring.
But within that minute a crosstown car had stopped directly in front of the cab. The
cabman tried to pass to the left, but a heavy express wagon cut him off. He tried the right,
and had to back away from a furniture van that had no business to be there. He tried to back
out, but dropped his reins and swore dutifully. He was blockaded in a tangled mess of
vehicles and horses.
One of those street blockades had occurred that sometimes tie up commerce and
movement quite suddenly in the big city.&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you drive on?&rdquo; said Miss Lantry, impatiently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be late.&rdquo;
Richard stood up in the cab and looked around. He saw a congested flood of wagons,
trucks, cabs, vans and street cars filling the vast space where Broadway, Sixth Avenue and
Thirly-fourth street cross one another as a twenty-six inch maiden fills her twenty-two inch
girdle. And still from all the cross streets they were hurrying and rattling toward the
converging point at full speed, and hurling thcmselves into the struggling mass, locking
wheels and adding their drivers&rsquo; imprecations to the clamour. The entire traffic of
Manhattan seemed to have jammed itself around them. The oldest New Yorker among the
thousands of spectators that lined the sidewalks had not witnessed a street blockade of the
proportions of this one.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; said Richard, as he resumed his seat, &ldquo;but it looks as if we are stuck.
They won&rsquo;t get this jumble loosened up in an hour. It was my fault. If I hadn&rsquo;t dropped the
ring we&ndash;&ldquo;Let me see the ring,&rdquo; said Miss Lantry. &ldquo;Now that it can&rsquo;t be helped, I don&rsquo;t care. I
think theatres are stupid, anyway.&rdquo;
At 11 o&rsquo;clock that night somebody tapped lightly on Anthony Rockwall&rsquo;s door.
&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; shouted Anthony, who was in a red dressing-gown, reading a book of
piratical adventures.
Somebody was Aunt Ellen, looking like a grey-haired angel that had been left on earth
by mistake.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re engaged, Anthony,&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;She has promised to marry our Richard.
On their way to the theatre there was a street blockade, and it was two hours before their
cab could get out of it.
&ldquo;And oh, brother Anthony, don&rsquo;t ever boast of the power of money again. A little
emblem of true love&ndash;a little ring that symbolised unending and unmercenary affection&ndash;was
the cause of our Richard finding his happiness. He dropped it in the street, and got out to
recover it. And before they could continue the blockade occurred. He spoke to his love and
won her there while the cab was hemmed in. Money is dross compared with true love,
Anthony.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said old Anthony. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad the boy has got what he wanted. I told him I
wouldn&rsquo;t spare any expense in the matter if&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;But, brother Anthony, what good could your money have done?&rdquo;&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said Anthony Rockwall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my pirate in a devil of a scrape. His ship has
just been scuttled, and he&rsquo;s too good a judge of the value of money to let drown. I wish you
would let me go on with this chapter.&rdquo;
The story should end here. I wish it would as heartily as you who read it wish it did. But
we must go to the bottom of the well for truth.
The next day a person with red hands and a blue polka-dot necktie, who called himself
Kelly, called at Anthony Rockwall&rsquo;s house, and was at once received in the library.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Anthony, reaching for his chequebook, &ldquo;it was a good bilin&rsquo; of soap. Let&rsquo;s
see&ndash;you had $5,000 in cash.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I paid out $3OO more of my own,&rdquo; said Kelly. &ldquo;I had to go a little above the estimate. I
got the express wagons and cabs mostly for $5; but the trucks and two-horse teams mostly
raised me to $10. The motormen wanted $10, and some of the loaded teams $20. The cops
struck me hardest&ndash;$50 I paid two, and the rest $20 and $25. But didn&rsquo;t it work beautiful, Mr.
Rockwall? I&rsquo;m glad William A. Brady wasn&rsquo;t onto that little outdoor vehicle mob scene. I
wouldn&rsquo;t want William to break his heart with jealousy. And never a rehearsal, either! The
boys was on time to the fraction of a second. It was two hours before a snake could get
below Greeley&rsquo;s statue.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thirteen hundred&ndash;there you are, Kelly,&rdquo; said Anthony, tearing off a check. &ldquo;Your
thousand, and the $300 you were out. You don&rsquo;t despise money, do you, Kelly?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Kelly. &ldquo;I can lick the man that invented poverty.&rdquo;
Anthony called Kelly when he was at the door.
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t notice,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;anywhere in the tie-up, a kind of a fat boy without any
clothes on shooting arrows around with a bow, did you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Kelly, mystified. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. If he was like you say, maybe the cops pinched
him before I got there.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I thought the little rascal wouldn&rsquo;t be on hand,&rdquo; chuckled Anthony. &ldquo;Good-by, Kelly.&rdquo;
Man About Town （O·Henry）
___________________________________________There were two or three things that I wanted to know. I do not care about a mystery. So
I began to inquire.
It took me two weeks to find out what women carry in dress suit cases. And then I
began to ask why a mattress is made in two pieces. This serious query was at first received
with suspicion because it sounded like a conundrum. I was at last assured that its double
form of construction was designed to make lighter the burden of woman, who makes up
beds. I was so foolish as to persist, begging to know why, then, they were not made in two
equal pieces; whereupon I was shunned.
The third draught that I craved from the fount of knowledge was enlightenment
concerning the character known as A Man About Town. He was more vague in my mind than
a type should be. We must have a concrete idea of anything, even if it be an imaginary idea,
before we can comprehend it. Now, I have a mental picture of John Doe that is as clear as a
steel engraving. His eyes are weak blue; he wears a brown vest and a shiny black serge coat.
He stands always in the sunshine chewing something; and he keeps half-shutting his
pocket knife and opening it again with his thumb. And, if the Man Higher Up is ever found,
take my assurance for it, he will be a large, pale man with blue wristlets showing under his
cuffs, and he will be sitting to have his shoes polisbed within sound of a bowling alley, and
there will be somewhere about him turquoises.
But the canvas of my imagination, when it came to limning the Man About Town, was
blank. I fancied that he bad a detachable sneer (like the smile of the Cheshire cat) and
attached cuffs; and that was all. Whereupon I asked a newspaper reporter about him.
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a &lsquo;Man About Town&rsquo; something between a &lsquo;rounder&rsquo; and a &lsquo;clubman.&rsquo;
He isn&rsquo;t exactly&ndash;well, he fits in between Mrs. Fish&rsquo;s receptions and private boxing bouts. He
doesn&rsquo;t&ndash;well, he doesn&rsquo;t belong either to the Lotos Club or to the Jerry McGeogheghan
Galvanised Iron Workers&rsquo; Apprentices&rsquo; Left Hook Chowder Association. I don&rsquo;t exactly know
how to describe him to you. You&rsquo;ll see him everywhere there&rsquo;s anything doing. Yes, I suppose
he&rsquo;s a type. Dress clothes every evening; knows the ropes; calls every policeman and waiter
in town by their first names. No; he never travels with the hydrogen derivatives. You
generally see him alone or with another man.&rdquo;
My friend the reporter left me, and I wandered further afield. By this time the 3126
electric lights on the Rialto were alight. People passed, but they held me not. Paphian eyes
rayed upon me, and left me unscathed. Diners, heimgangers, shop-girls, confidence men,
panhandlers, actors, highwaymen, millionaires and outlanders hurried, skipped, strolled,
sneaked, swaggered and scurried by me; but I took no note of them. I knew them all; I had
read their hearts; they had served. I wanted my Man About Town. He was a type, and to
drop him would be an error&ndash;a typograph&ndash;but no! let us continue.Let us continue with a moral digression. To see a family reading the Sunday paper
gratifies. The sections have been separated. Papa is earnestly scanning the page that
pictures the young lady exercising before an open window, and bending&ndash;but there, there!
Mamma is interested in trying to guess the missing letters in the word N_w Yo_k. The oldest
girls are eagerly perusing the financial reports, for a certain young man remarked last
Sunday night that he had taken a flyer in Q., X. &amp; Z. Willie, the eighteen-year-old son, who
attends the New York public school, is absorbed in the weekly article describing how to
make over an old skirt, for he hopes to take a prize in sewing on graduation day.
Grandma is holding to the comic supplement with a two-hours&rsquo; grip; and little Tottie,
the baby, is rocking along the best she can with the real estatc transfers. This view is
intended to be reassuring, for it is desirable that a few lines of this story be skipped. For it
introduces strong drink.
I went into a cafe to &ndash; and while it was being mixed I asked the man who grabs up your
hot Scotch spoon as soon as you lay it down what he undcrstood by the term, epithet,
description, designation, characterisation or appellation, viz.: a &ldquo;Man About Town.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, carefully, &ldquo;it means a fly guy that&rsquo;s wise to the all-night push&ndash;see? It&rsquo;s a
hot sport that you can&rsquo;t bump to the rail anywhere between the Flatirons&ndash;see? I guess
that&rsquo;s about what it means.&rdquo;
I thanked him and departed.
On the sidewalk a Salvation lassie shook her contribution receptacle gently against my
waistcoat pocket.
&ldquo;Would you mind telling me,&rdquo; I asked her, &ldquo;if you ever meet with the character
commonly denominated as &lsquo;A Man About Town&rsquo; during your daily wanderings?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I think I know whom you mean,&rdquo; she answered, with a gentle smile. &ldquo;We see them in
the same places night after night. They are the devil&rsquo;s body guard, and if the soldiers of any
army are as faithful as they are, their commanders are well served. We go among them,
diverting a few pennies from their wickedness to the Lord&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;
She shook the box again and I dropped a dime into it.
In front of a glittering hotel a friend of mine, a critic, was climbing from a cab. He
seemed at leisure; and I put my question to him. He answered me conscientiously, as I was
sure he would.
&ldquo;There is a type of &lsquo;Man About Town&rsquo; in New York,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The term is quite
familiar to me, but I don&rsquo;t think I was ever called upon to define the character before. It
would be difficult to point you out an exact specimen. I would say, offhand, that it is a manwho had a hopeless case of the peculiar New York disease of wanting to see and know. At 6
o&rsquo;clock each day life begins with him. He follows rigidly the conventions of dress and
manners; but in the business of poking his nose into places where he does not belong he
could give pointers to a civet cat or a jackdaw. He is the man who has chased Bohemia about
the town from rathskeller to roof garden and from Hester street to Harlem until you can&rsquo;t
find a place in the city where they don&rsquo;t cut their spaghetti with a knife. Your &lsquo;Man About
Town&rsquo; has done that. He is always on the scent of something new. He is curiosity, impudence
and omnipresence. Hansoms were made for him, and gold-banded cigars; and the curse of
music at dinner. There are not so many of him; but his minority report is adopted
everywhere.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you brought up the subject; I&rsquo;ve felt the influence of this nocturnal blight
upon our city, but I never thought to analyse it before. I can see now that your &lsquo;Man About
Town&rsquo; should havc been classified long ago. In his wake spring up wine agents and cloak
models; and the orchestra &lsquo;p1ays &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s All Go Up to Maud&rsquo;s&rsquo; for him, by request, instead of
Handel. He makes his rounds every evening; while you and I see the elephant once a week.
When the cigar store is raided, he winks at the officer, familiar with his ground, and walks
away immune, while you and I search among the Presidents for names, and among the stars
for addresses to give the desk sergeant.&rdquo;
My friend, the critic, paused to acquire breath for fresh eloquence. I seized my
advantage.
&ldquo;You have classified him,&rdquo; I cried with joy. &ldquo;You have painted his portrait in the gallery of
city types. But I must meet one face to face. I must study the Man About Town at first hand.
Where shall I find him? How shall I know him?&rdquo;
Without seeming to hear me, the critic went on. And his cab-driver was waiting for his
fare, too.
&ldquo;He is the sublimated essence of Butt-in; the refined, intrinsic extract of Rubber; the
concentrated, purified, irrefutable, unavoidable spirit of Curiosity and Inquisitiveness. A new
sensation is the breath in his nostrils; when his experience is exhausted he explores new
fields with the indefatigability of a&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;but can you produce one of this type? It is a new thing to
me. I must study it. I will search the town over until I find one. Its habitat must be here on
Broadway.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am about to dine here,&rdquo; said my friend. &ldquo;Come inside, and if there is a Man About
Town present I will point him out to you. I know most of the regular patrons here.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am not dining yet,&rdquo; I said to him. &ldquo;You will excuse me. I am going to find my Man
About Town this night if I have to rake New York from the Battery to Little Coney Island.&ldquo;I left the hotel and walked down Broadway. The pursuit of my type gave a pleasant
savour of life and interest to the air I breathed. I was glad to be in a city so great, so complex
and diversified. Leisurely and with something of an air I strolled along with my heart
expanding at the thought that I was a citizen of great Gotham, a sharer in its magnificence
and pleasures, a partaker in its glory and prestige.
I turned to cross the street. I heard something buzz like a bee, and then I took a long,
pleasant ride with Santos-Dumont.
When I opened my eyes I remembered a smell of gasoline, and I said aloud: &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it
passed yet?&rdquo;
A hospital nurse laid a hand that was not particularly soft upon my brow that was not at
all fevered. A young doctor came along, grinned, and handed me a morning newspaper.
&ldquo;Want to see how it happened?&rdquo; he asked cheerily. I read the article. Its headlines
began where I heard the buzzing leave off the night before. It closed with these lines:
Bellevue Hospital, where it was said that his injuries were not serious. He appeared to
be a typica1 Man About Town.&rdquo;
The Marry Month of May （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>PRITHEE, smite the poet in the eye when he would sing to you praises of the month of
May. It is a month presided over by the spirits of mischief and madness. Pixies and
flibbertigibbets haunt the budding woods: Puck and his train of midgets are busy in town
and country.
In May nature holds up at us a chiding finger, bidding us remember that we are not
gods, but overconceited members of her own great family. She reminds us that we are
brothers to the chowder-doomed clam and the donkey; lineal scions of the pansy and the
chimpanzee, and but cousins-german to the cooing doves, the quacking ducks and the
housemaids and policemen in the parks.
In May Cupid shoots blindfolded &ndash; millionaires marry stenographers; wise professors
woo white-aproned gum-chewers behind quick-lunch counters; schoolma&rsquo;ams make big bad
boys remain after school; lads with ladders steal lightly over lawns where Juliet waits in her
trellissed window with her telescope packed; young couples out for a walk come home
married; old chaps put on white spats and promenade near the Normal School; evenmarried men, grown unwontedly tender and sentimental, whack their spouses on the back
and growl: &ldquo;How goes it, old girl:&rdquo;
This May, who is no goddess, but Circe, masquerading at the dance given in honour of
the fair débutante, Summer, puts the kibosh on us all.
Old Mr. Coulson groaned a little, and then sat up straight in his invalid&rsquo;s chair. He had
the gout very bad in one foot, a house near Gramercy Park, half a million dollars and a
daughter. And he had a housekeeper, Mrs. Widdup. The fact and the name deserve a
sentence each. They have it.
When May poked Mr. Coulson he became elder brother to the turtle-dove. In the
window near which he sat were boxes of jonquils, of hyacinths, geraniums and pansies. The
breeze brought their odour into the room. Immediately there was a well-contested round
between the breath of the flowers and the able and active effluvium from gout liniment. The
liniment won easily; but not before the flowers got an uppercut to old Mr. Coulson&rsquo;s nose.
The deadly work of the implacable, false enchantress May was done.
Across the park to the olfactories of Mr. Coulson came other unmistakable,
characteristic, copyrighted smells of spring that belong to the-big-city-above-the-Subway,
alone. The smells of hot asphalt, underground caverns, gasoline, patchouli, orange peel,
sewer gas, Albany grabs, Egyptian cigarettes, mortar and the undried ink on newspapers.
The inblowing air was sweet and mild. Sparrows wrangled happily everywhere outdoors.
Never trust May.
Mr. Coulson twisted the ends of his white mustache, cursed his foot, and pounded a
bell on the table by his side.
In came Mrs. Widdup. She was comely to the eye, fair, flustered, forty and foxy.
&ldquo;Higgins is out, sir,&rdquo; she said, with a smile suggestive of vibratory massage. &ldquo;He went to
post a letter. Can I do anything for you, sir?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for my aconite,&rdquo; said old Mr. Coulson. &ldquo;Drop it for me. The bottle&rsquo;s there.
Three drops. In water. D &ndash; that is, confound Higgins! There&rsquo;s nobody in this house cares if I
die here in this chair for want of attention.&rdquo;
Mrs. Widdup sighed deeply.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be saying that, sir,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s them that would care more than any one
knows. Thirteen drops, you said, sir?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; said old man Coulson.He took his dose and then Mrs. Widdup&rsquo;s hand. She blushed. Oh, yes, it can be done.
Just hold your breath and compress the diaphragm.
&ldquo;Mrs. Widdup,&rdquo; said Mr. Coulson, &ldquo;the springtime&rsquo;s full upon us.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo; said Mrs. Widdup. &ldquo;The air&rsquo;s real warm. And there&rsquo;s bock-beer signs
on every corner. And the park&rsquo;s all yaller and pink and blue with flowers; and I have such
shooting pains up my legs and body.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;In the spring,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Mr. Coulson, curling his mustache, &ldquo;&lsquo;a y&ndash; that is, a man&rsquo;s &ndash;
fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.&lsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lawsy, now!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Widdup; &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t that right? Seems like it&rsquo;s in the air.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;In the spring,&rsquo;&rdquo; continued old Mr. Coulson, &ldquo;&lsquo;a livelier iris shines upon the burnished
dove.&lsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;They do be lively, the Irish,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Widdup pensively.
&ldquo;Mrs. Widdup,&rdquo; said Mr. Coulson, making a face at a twinge of his gouty foot, &ldquo;this
would be a lonesome house without you. I&rsquo;m an &ndash; that is, I&rsquo;m an elderly man &ndash; but I&rsquo;m
worth a comfortable lot of money. If half a million dollars&rsquo; worth of Government bonds and
the true affection of a heart that, though no longer beating with the first ardour of youth,
can still throb with genuine &ndash; &ldquo;
The loud noise of an overturned chair near the portières of the adjoining room
interrupted the venerable and scarcely suspecting victim of May.
In stalked Miss Van Meeker Constantia Coulson, bony, durable, tall, high-nosed, frigid,
well-bred, thirty-five, in-the-neighbourhood-of-Gramercy-Parkish. She put up a lorgnette.
Mrs. Widdup hastily stooped and arranged the bandages on Mr. Coulson&rsquo;s gouty foot.
&ldquo;I thought Higgins was with you,&rdquo; said Miss Van Meeker Constantia.
&ldquo;Higgins went out,&rdquo; explained her father, &ldquo;and Mrs. Widdup answered the bell. That is
better now, Mrs. Widdup, thank you. No; there is nothing else I require.&rdquo;
The housekeeper retired, pink under the cool, inquiring stare of Miss Coulson.
&ldquo;This spring weather is lovely, isn&rsquo;t it, daughter?&rdquo; said the old man, consciously
conscious.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; replied Miss Van Meeker Constantia Coulson, somewhat obscurely.
&ldquo;When does Mrs. Widdup start on her vacation, papa?&rdquo;&ldquo;I believe she said a week from to-day,&rdquo; said Mr. Coulson.
Miss Van Meeker Constantia stood for a minute at the window gazing, toward the little
park, flooded with the mellow afternoon sunlight. With the eye of a botanist she viewed the
flowers &ndash; most potent weapons of insidious May. With the cool pulses of a virgin of Cologne
she withstood the attack of the ethereal mildness. The arrows of the pleasant sunshine fell
back, frostbitten, from the cold panoply of her unthrilled bosom. The odour of the flowers
waked no soft sentiments in the unexplored recesses of her dormant heart. The chirp of the
sparrows gave her a pain. She mocked at May.
But although Miss Coulson was proof against the season, she was keen enough to
estimate its power. She knew that elderly men and thick-waisted women jumped as
educated fleas in the ridiculous train of May, the merry mocker of the months. She had
heard of foolish old gentlemen marrying their housekeepers before. What a humiliating
thing, after all, was this feeling called love!
The next morning at 8 o&rsquo;clock, when the iceman called, the cook told him that Miss
Coulson wanted to see him in the basement.
&ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t I the Olcott and Depew; not mentioning the first name at all?&rdquo; said the
iceman, admiringly, of himself.
As a concession he rolled his sleeves down, dropped his icehooks on a syringe and went
back. When Miss Van Meeker Constantia Coulson addressed him he took off his bat.
&ldquo;There is a rear entrance to this basement,&rdquo; said Miss Coulson, &ldquo;which can be reached
by driving into the vacant lot next door, where they are excavating for a building. I want you
to bring in that way within two hours 1,000 pounds of ice. You may have to bring another
man or two to help you. I will show you where I want it placed. I also want 1,000 pounds a
day delivered the same way for the next four days. Your company may charge the ice on our
regular bill. This is for your extra trouble.&rdquo;
Miss Coulson tendered a ten-dollar bill. The iceman bowed, and held his hat in his two
hands behind him.
&ldquo;Not if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, lady. It&rsquo;ll be a pleasure to fix things up for you any way you
please.&rdquo;
Alas for May!
About noon Mr. Coulson knocked two glasses off his table, broke the spring of his bell
and yelled for Higgins at the same time.&ldquo;Bring an axe,&rdquo; commanded Mr. Coulson, sardonically, or send out for a quart of prussic
acid, or have a policeman come in and shoot me. I&rsquo;d rather that than be frozen to death.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It does seem to be getting cool, Sir,&rdquo; said Higgins. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it before. I&rsquo;ll close
the window, Sir.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Mr. Coulson. &ldquo;They call this spring, do they? If it keeps up long I&rsquo;ll go back to
Palm Beach. House feels like a morgue.&rdquo;
Later Miss Coulson dutifully came in to inquire how the gout was progressing.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Stantia,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;how is the weather outdoors?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bright,&rdquo; answered Miss Coulson, &ldquo;but chilly.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Feels like the dead of winter to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Coulson.
&ldquo;An instance,&rdquo; said Constantia, gazing abstractedly out the window, &ldquo; of &lsquo;winter
lingering in the lap of spring,&rsquo; though the metaphor is not in the most refined taste.&rdquo;
A little later she walked down by the side of the little park and on westward to
Broadway to accomplish a little shopping.
A little later than that Mrs. Widdup entered the invalid&rsquo;s room.
&ldquo;Did you ring, Sir?&rdquo; she asked, dimpling in many places. &ldquo;I asked Higgins to go to the
drug store, and I thought I heard your bell.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; said Mr. Coulson.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Mrs. Widdup, &ldquo;I interrupted you sir, yesterday when you were about
to say something.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How comes it, Mrs. Widdup,&rdquo; said old man Coulson sternly, &ldquo;that I find it so cold in this
house?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cold, Sir?&rdquo; said the housekeeper, &ldquo;why, now, since you speak of it it do seem cold in
this room. But, outdoors it&rsquo;s as warm and fine as June, sir. And how this weather do seem to
make one&rsquo;s heart jump out of one&rsquo;s shirt waist, sir. And the ivy all leaved out on the side of
the house, and the hand-organs playing, and the children dancing on the sidewalk &ndash; &lsquo;tis a
great time for speaking out what&rsquo;s in the heart. You were saying yesterday, sir &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Woman!&rdquo; roared Mr. Coulson; &ldquo;you are a fool. I pay you to take care of this house. I am
freezing to death in my own room, and you come in and drivel to me about ivy andhand-organs. Get me an overcoat at once. See that all doors and windows are closed below.
An old, fat, irresponsible, one-sided object like you prating about springtime and flowers in
the middle of winter! When Higgins comes back, tell him to bring me a hot rum punch. And
now get out!&rdquo;
But who shall shame the bright face of May? Rogue though she be and disturber of
sane men&rsquo;s peace, no wise virgins cunning nor cold storage shall make her bow her head in
the bright galaxy of months.
Oh, yes, the story was not quite finished.
A night passed, and Higgins helped old man Coulson in the morning to his chair by the
window. The cold of the room was gone. Heavenly odours and fragrant mildness entered.
In hurried Mrs. Widdup, and stood by his chair. Mr. Coulson reached his bony hand and
grasped her plump one.
&ldquo;Mrs. Widdup,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this house would be no home without you. I have half a
million dollars. If that and the true affection of a heart no lonoer in its youthful prime, but
still not cold, could &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;I found out what made it cold,&rdquo; said Mrs. Widdup, leanin&rsquo; against his chair. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas ice &ndash;
tons of it &ndash; in the basement and in the furnace room, everywhere. I shut off the registers
that it was coming through into your room, Mr. Coulson, poor soul! And now it&rsquo;s Maytime
again.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A true heart,&rdquo; went on old man Coulson, a little wanderingly, &ldquo;that the springtime has
brought to life again, and &ndash; but what will my daughter say, Mrs. Widdup?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Never fear, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Widdup, cheerfully. &ldquo;Miss Coulson, she ran away with the
iceman last night, sir!&rdquo;
A Matter of Mean Elevation （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>ONE winter the Alcazar Opera Company of New Orleans made a speculative trip along
the Mexican, Central American and South American coasts. The venture proved a most
successful one. The music- loving, impressionable Spanish-Americans deluged the company
with dollars and &ldquo;vivas.&rdquo; The manager waxed plump and amiable. But for the prohibitive
climate he would have put forth the distinctive flower of his prosperity &ndash; the overcoat of fur,
braided, frogged and opulent. Almost was he persuaded to raise the salaries of his company.But with a mighty effort he conquered the impulse toward such an unprofitable
effervescence of joy.
At Macuto, on the coast of Venezuela, the company scored its greatest success. Imagine
Coney Island translated into Spanish and you will comprehend Macuto. The fashionable
season is from November to March. Down from La Guayra and Caracas and Valencia and
other interior towns flock the people for their holiday sea- son. There are bathing and fiestas
and bull fights and scandal. And then the people have a passion for music that the bands in
the plaza and on the sea beach stir but do not satisfy. The coming of the Alcazar Opera Company aroused the utmost ardour and zeal among the pleasure seekers.
The illustrious Guzman Blanco, President and Dic- tator of Venezuela, sojourned in
Macuto with his court for the season. That potent ruler &ndash; who himself paid a subsidy of
40,000 pesos each year to grand opera in Caracas &ndash; ordered one of the Government
warehouses to be cleared for a temporary theatre. A stage was quickly constructed and
rough wooden benches made for the audience. Private boxes were added for the use of the
President and the notables of the army and Government.
The company remained in Macuto for two weeks. Each performance filled the house as
closely as it could be packed. Then the music-mad people fought for room in the open doors
and windows, and crowded about, hundreds deep, on the outside. Those audiences formed
a brilliantly diversified patch of colour. The hue of their faces ranged from the clear olive of
the pure-blood Span- iards down through the yellow and brown shades of the Mestizos to
the coal-black Carib and the Jamaica Negro. Scattered among them were little groups of
Indians with faces like stone idols, wrapped in gaudy fibre-woven blankets &ndash; Indians down
from the mountain states of Zamora and Los Andes and Miranda to trade their gold dust in
the coast towns.
The spell cast upon these denizens of the interior fastnesses was remarkable. They sat
in petrified ecstasy, conspicuous among the excitable Macutians, who wildly strove with
tongue and hand to give evidence of their delight. Only once did the sombre rapture of
these aboriginals find expression. During the rendition of &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; Guzman Blanco,
extravagantly pleased by the &ldquo;Jewel Song,&rdquo; cast upon the stage a purse of gold pieces. Other
distinguished citizens followed his lead to the extent of whatever loose coin they had
convenient, while some of the fair and fashionable se?oras were moved, in imita- tion, to
fling a jewel or a ring or two at the feet of the Marguerite &ndash; who was, according to the bills,
Mlle. Nina Giraud. Then, from different parts of the house rose sundry of the stolid hillmen
and cast upon the stage little brown and dun bags that fell with soft &ldquo;thumps&rdquo; and did not
rebound. It was, no doubt, pleasure at the tribute to her art that caused Mlle. Giraud&rsquo;s eyes
to shine so brightly when she opened these little deerskin bags in her dressing room and
found them to contain pure gold dust. If so, the pleasure was rightly hers, for her voice in
song, pure, strong and thrilling with the feeling of the emotional artist, deserved the tribute
that it earned.But the triumph of the Alcazar Opera Company is not the theme &ndash; it but leans upon
and colours it. There happened in Macuto a tragic thing, an unsolvable mystery, that
sobered for a time the gaiety of the happy season.
One evening between the short twilight and the time when she should have whirled
upon the stage in the red and black of the ardent Carmen, Mlle. Nina Giraud dis- appeared
from the sight and ken of 6,000 pairs of eyes and as many minds in Macuto. There was the
usual turmoil and hurrying to seek her. Messengers flew to the little French-kept hotel
where she stayed; others of the company hastened here or there where she might be
lingering in some tienda or unduly prolonging her bath upon the beach. All search was
fruitless. Mademoi- selle had vanished.
Half an hour passed and she did not appear. The dictator, unused to the caprices of
prime donne, became impatient. He sent an aide from his box to say to the manager that if
the curtain did not at once rise he would immediately hale the entire company to the
calabosa, though it would desolate his heart, indeed, to be com- pelled to such an act. Birds
in Macuto could be made to sing.
The manager abandoned hope for the time of Mlle. Giraud. A member of the chorus,
who had dreamed hopelessly for years of the blessed opportunity, quickly Carmenized
herself and the opera went on.
Afterward, when the lost cantatrice appeared not, the aid of the authorities was
invoked. The President at once set the army, the police and all citizens to the search. Not
one clue to Mlle. Giraud&rsquo;s disappearance was found. The Alcazar left to fill engagements
farther down the coast.
On the way back the steamer stopped at Macuto and the manager made anxious
inquiry. Not a trace of the lady had been discovered. The Alcazar could do no more. The
personal belongings of the missing lady were stored in the hotel against her possible later
reappearance and the opera company continued upon its homeward voyage to New
Orleans.
On the camino real along the beach the two saddle mules and the four pack mules of
Don Se?or Johnny Armstrong stood, patiently awaiting the crack of the whip of the arriero,
Luis. That would be the signal for the start on another long journey into the mountains. The
pack mules were loaded with a varied assortment of hard- ware and cutlery. These articles
Don Johnny traded to the interior Indians for the gold dust that they washed from the
Andean streams and stored in quills and bags against his coming. It was a profitable business,
and Se?or Armstrong expected soon to be able to purchase the coffee plantation that he
coveted.
Armstrong stood on the narrow sidewalk, exchanging garbled Spanish with old Peralto,
the rich native merchant who had just charged him four prices for half a gross of pot-metalhatchets, and abridged English with Rucker, the little German who was Consul for the United
States.
&ldquo;Take with you, se?or,&rdquo; said Peralto, &ldquo;the blessings of the saints upon your journey.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Better try quinine,&rdquo; growled Rucker through his pipe. &ldquo;Take two grains every night.
And don&rsquo;t make your trip too long, Johnny, because we haf needs of you. It is ein villainous
game dot Melville play of whist, and dere is no oder substitute. Auf wiedersehen, und keep
your eyes dot mule&rsquo;s ears between when you on der edge of der brecipices ride.&rdquo;
The bells of Luis&rsquo;s mule jingled and the pack train filed after the warning note.
Armstrong, waved a good- bye and took his place at the tail of the procession. Up the
narrow street they turned, and passed the two-story wooden Hotel Ingles, where Ives and
Dawson and Rich- ards and the rest of the chaps were dawdling on the broad piazza, reading
week-old newspapers. They crowded to the railing and shouted many friendly and wise and
foolish farewells after him. Across the plaza they trotted slowly past the bronze statue of
Guzman Blanco, within its fence of bayoneted rifles captured from revolutionists, and out of
the town between the rows of thatched huts swarming with the unclothed youth of Macuto.
They plunged into the damp coolness of banana groves at length to emerge upon a bright
stream, where brown women in scant raiment laundered clothes destructively upon the
rocks. Then the pack train, fording the stream, attacked the sudden ascent, and bade adieu
to such civilization as the coast afforded.
For weeks Armstrong, guided by Luis, followed his regular route among the mountains.
After he had col- lected an arroba of the precious metal, winning a profit of nearly $5,000,
the heads of the lightened mules were turned down-trail again. Where the head of the
Guarico River springs from a great gash in the mountain-side, Luis halted the train.
&ldquo;Half a day&rsquo;s journey from here, Se?or,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the village of Tacuzama, which we
have never visited. I think many ounces of gold may be procured there. It is worth the trial.&rdquo;
Armstrong concurred, and they turned again upward toward Tacuzama. The trail was
abrupt and precipi- tous mounting through a dense forest. As night fell, dark and gloomy,
Luis once more halted. Before them was a black chasm, bisecting the path as far as they
could see.
Luis dismounted. &ldquo;There should be a bridge,&rdquo; he called, and ran along the cleft a
distance. &ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; he cried, and remounting, led the way. In a few moments Armstrong,
heard a sound as though a thunderous drum were beating somewhere in the dark. It was
the falling of the mules&rsquo; hoofs upon the bridge made of strong hides lashed to poles and
stretched across the chasm. Half a mile further was Tacuzama. The village was a congregation of rock and mud huts set in the profundity of an obscure wood. As they rode in a
sound inconsistent with that brooding solitude met their ears. From a long, low mud hutthat they were nearing rose the glorious voice of a woman in song. The words were English,
the air familiar to Armstrong&rsquo;s memory, but not to his musical knowledge.
He slipped from his mule and stole to a narrow window in one end of the house.
Peering cautiously inside, he saw, within three feet of him, a woman of marvellous, imposing
beauty, clothed in a splendid loose robe of leopard skins. The hut was packed close to the
small space in which she stood with the squatting figures of Indians.
The woman finished her song and seated herself close to the little window, as if grateful
for the unpolluted air that entered it. When she had ceased several of the audience rose and
cast little softly-falling bags at her feet. A harsh murmur &ndash; no doubt a barbarous kind of
applause and comment &ndash; went through the grim assembly.
Armstrong, was used to seizing opportunities promptly. Taking advantage of the noise
he called to the woman in a low but distinct voice: &ldquo;Do not turn your head this way, but
listen. I am an American. If you need assistance tell me how I can render it. Answer as briefly
as you can.&rdquo;
The woman was worthy of his boldness. Only by a sudden flush of her pale cheek did
she acknowledge understanding of his words. Then she spoke, scarcely moving her lips.
&ldquo;I am held a prisoner by these Indians. God knows I need help. In two hours come to
the little hut twenty yards toward the Mountainside. There will be a light and a red curtain
in the window. There is always a guard at the door, whom you will have to overcome. For
the love of heaven, do not fail to come.&rdquo;
The story seems to shrink from adventure and rescue and mystery. The theme is one
too gentle for those brave and quickening tones. And yet it reaches as far back as time itself.
It has been named &ldquo;environment,&rdquo; which is as weak a word as any to express the
unnameable kinship of man to nature, that queer fraternity that causes stones and trees and
salt water and clouds to play upon our emotions. Why are we made serious and solemn and
sublime by mountain heights, grave and contempla- tive by an abundance of overhanging
trees, reduced to inconstancy and monkey capers by the ripples on a sandy beach? Did the
protoplasm &ndash; but enough. The chem- ists are looking into the matter, and before long they
will have all life in the table of the symbols.
Briefly, then, in order to confine the story within scientific bounds, John Armstrong,
went to the hut, choked the Indian guard and carried away Mlle. Giraud. With her was also
conveyed a number of pounds of gold dust she had collected during her six months&rsquo; forced
engage- ment in Tacuzama. The Carabobo Indians are easily the most enthusiastic lovers of
music between the equator and the French Opera House in New Orleans. They are also
strong believers that the advice of Emerson was good when he said: &ldquo;The thing thou wantest,
0 discon- tented man &ndash; take it, and pay the price.&rdquo; A number of them had attended the
performance of the Alcazar Opera Company in Macuto, and found Mlle. Giraud&rsquo;s style andtechnique satisfactory. They wanted her, so they took her one evening suddenly and without
any fuss. They treated her with much consideration, exacting only one song recital each day.
She was quite pleased at being rescued by Mr. Armstrong. So much for mystery and
adventure. Now to resume the theory of the proto- plasm.
John Armstrong and Mlle. Giraud rode among the Andean peaks, enveloped in their
greatness and sublimity. The mightiest cousins, furthest removed, in nature&rsquo;s great family
become conscious of the tie. Among those huge piles of primordial upheaval, amid those
gigantic silences and elongated fields of distance the littlenesses of men are precipitated as
one chemical throws down a sediment from another. They moved reverently, as in a temple.
Their souls were uplifted in unison with the stately heights. They travelled in a zone of
majesty and peace.
To Armstrong the woman seemed almost a holy thing. Yet bathed in the white, still
dignity of her martyrdom that purified her earthly beauty and gave out, it seemed, an aura
of transcendent loveliness, in those first hours of companionship she drew from him an
adoration that was half human love, half the worship of a descended goddess.
Never yet since her rescue had she smiled. Over her dress she still wore the robe of
leopard skins, for mountain air was cold. She looked to be some splendid princess belonging
to those wild and awesome altitudes. The spirit of the region chimed with hers. Her eyes
were always turned upon the sombre cliffs, the blue gorges and the snow-clad turrets,
looking a sublime melancholy equal to their own. At times on the journey she sang thrilling
te deums and misereres that struck the true note of the hills, and made their route seem like
a solemn march down a cathedral aisle. The rescued one spoke but seldom, her mood
partaking of the hush of nature that surrounded them. Armstrong looked upon her as an
angel. He could not bring himself to the sacrilege of attempting to woo her as other women
may be wooed.
On the third day they had descended as far as the tierra templada, the zona of the table
lands and foot hills. The mountains were receding in their rear, but still towered, exhibiting
yet impressively their formidable heads. Here they met signs of man. They saw the white
houses of coffee plantations gleam across the clear- ings. They struck into a road where they
met travellers and pack-mules. Cattle were grazing on the slopes. They passed a little village
where the round-eyed ni?os shrieked and called at sight of them.
Mlle. Giraud laid aside her leopard-skin robe. It seemed to be a trifle incongruous now.
In the moun- tains it had appeared fitting and natural. And if Arm- strong was not mistaken
she laid aside with it something of the high dignity of her demeanour. As the country
became more populous and significant of comfortable life he saw, with a feeling of joy, that
the exalted princess and priestess of the Andean peaks was changing to a woman &ndash; an earth
woman but no less enticing. A little colour crept to the surface of her marble cheek. She
arranged the conventional dress that the removal of the robe now disclosed with the
solicitous touch of one who is conscious of the eyes of others. She smoothed the carelesssweep of her hair. A mundane interest, long latent in the chilling atmosphere of the ascetic
peaks, showed in her eyes.
This thaw in his divinity sent Armstrong&rsquo;s heart going faster. So might an Arctic explorer
thrill at his first ken of green fields and liquescent waters. They were on a lower plane of
earth and life and were succumbing to its peculiar, subtle influence. The austerity of the hills
no longer thinned the air they breathed. About them was the breath of fruit and corn and
builded homes, the comfortable smell of smoke and warm earth and the consolations man
has placed between himself and the dust of his brother earth from which he sprung. While
traversing those awful mountains, Mile. Giraud had seemed to be wrapped in their spirit of
reverent reserve. Was this that same woman &ndash; now palpitating, warm, eager, throbbing with
conscious life and charm, feminine to her finger-tips? Pondering over this, Armstrong felt
certain misgivings intrude upon his thoughts. He wished he could stop there with this
changing creature, descending no farther. Here was the elevation and environment to which
her nature seemed to respond with its best. He feared to go down upon the man-dominated
levels. Would her spirit -not yield still further in that artificial zone to which they were
descending?
Now from a little plateau they saw the sea flash at the edge of the green lowlands. Mile.
Giraud gave a little, catching sigh.
&ldquo;Oh! look, Mr. Armstrong, there is the sea! Isn&rsquo;t it lovely? I&rsquo;m so tired of mountains.&rdquo;
She heaved a pretty shoulder in a gesture of repugnance. &ldquo;Those horrid Indians! Just think of
what I suffered! Although I suppose I attained my ambition of becoming a stellar attraction, I
wouldn&rsquo;t care to repeat the engagement. It was very nice of you to bring me away. Tell me,
Mr. Armstrong &ndash; honestly, now &ndash; do I look such an awful, awful fright? I haven&rsquo;t looked into
a mirror, you know, for months.&rdquo;
Armstrong made answer according to his changed moods. Also he laid his hand upon
hers as it rested upon the horn of her saddle. Luis was at the head of the pack train and
could not see. She allowed it to remain there, and her eyes smiled frankly into his.
Then at sundown they dropped upon the coast level under the palms and lemons
among the vivid greens and searlets and ochres of the tierra caliente. They rode into Macuto,
and saw the line of volatile bathers frolick- ing in the surf. The mountains were very far away.
Mlle. Giraud&rsquo;s eyes were shining with a joy that could not have existed under the
chaperonage of the mountain- tops. There were other spirits calling to her &ndash; nymphs of the
orange groves, pixies from the chattering surf, imps, born of the music, the perfumes,
colours and the insinuating presence of humanity. She laughed aloud, musically, at a sudden
thought.&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t there be a sensation?&rdquo; she called to Armstrong. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I wish I had an
engagement just now, though! What a picnic the press agent would have! &lsquo;Held a prisoner
by a band of savage Indians subdued by the spell of her wonderful voice&rsquo; &ndash; wouldn&rsquo;t that
make great stuff? But I guess I quit the game winner, anyhow &ndash; there ought to be a couple of
thousand dollars in that sack of gold dust I collected as encores, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
He left her at the door of the little Hotel de Buen Descansar, where she had stopped
before. Two hours later he returned to the hotel. He glanced in at the open door of the little
combined reception room and cafe.
Half a dozen of Macuto&rsquo;s representative social and official caballeros were distributed
about the room. Sefior Villablanca, the wealthy rubber concessionist, reposed his fat figure
on two chairs, with an emollient smile beaming upon his chocolate-coloured face. Guil- bert,
the French mining engineer, leered through his polished nose-glasses. Colonel Mendez, of
the regular army, in gold-laced uniform and fatuous grin, was busily extracting corks from
champagne bottles. Other pat- terns of Macutian gallantry and fashion pranced and posed.
The air was hazy with cigarette smoke. Wine dripped upon the floor.
Perched upon a table in the centre of the room in an attitude of easy preeminence was
Mlle. Giraud. A chic costume of white lawn and cherry ribbons supplanted her travelling
garb. There was a suggestion of lace, and a frill or two, with a discreet, small implication of
hand- embroidered pink hosiery. Upon her lap rested a guitar. In her face was the light of
resurrection, the peace of elysium attained through fire and suffering. She was singing to a
lively accompaniment a little song:
&ldquo;When you see de big round moon
Comin&rsquo; up like a balloon,
Dis nigger skips fur to kiss de lips
Ob his stylish, black-faced coon.&rdquo;
The singer caught sight of Armstrong.
&ldquo;Hi! there, Johnny,&rdquo; she called; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been expecting you for an hour. What kept you?
Gee! but these smoked guys are the slowest you ever saw. They ain&rsquo;t on, at all. Come along
in, and I&rsquo;ll make this coffee- coloured old sport with the gold epaulettes open one for you
right off the ice.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Armstrong; &ldquo;not just now, I believe. I&rsquo;ve several things to attend to.&rdquo;
He walked out and down the street, and met Rucker coming up from the Consulate.
&ldquo;Play you a game of billiards,&rdquo; said Armstrong. &ldquo;I want something to take the taste of
the sea level out of my mouth.&ldquo;Memoirs of a Yellow Dog （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>I don&rsquo;t suppose it will knock any of you people off your perch to read a contribution
from an animal. Mr. Kipling and a good many others have demonstrated the fact that
animals can express themselves in remunerative English, and no magazine goes to press
nowadays without an animal story in it, except the old-style monthlies that are still running
pictures of Bryan and the Mont Pelee horror.
But you needn&rsquo;t look for any stuck-up literature in my piece, such as Bearoo, the bear,
and Snakoo, the snake, and Tammanoo, the tiger, talk in the jungle books. A yellow dog
that&rsquo;s spent most of his life in a cheap New York flat, sleeping in a corner on an old sateen
underskirt (the one she spilled port wine on at the Lady Longshoremen&rsquo;s banquet), mustn&rsquo;t
be expcctcd to perform any tricks with the art of speech.
I was born a yellow pup; date, locality, pedigree and weight unknown. The first thing I
can recollect, an old woman had me in a basket at Broadway and Twenty-third trying to sell
me to a fat lady. Old Mother Hubbard was boosting me to beat the band as a genuine
Pomeranian-Hambletonian-Red-Irish-Cochin-China-Stoke-Pogis fox terrier. The fat lady
chased a V around among the samples of gros grain flannelette in her shopping bag till she
cornered it, and gave up. From that moment I was a pet&ndash;a mamma&rsquo;s own wootsey
squidlums. Say, gentle reader, did you ever have a 200-pound woman breathing a flavour of
Camembert cheese and Peau d&rsquo;Espagne pick you up and wallop her nose all over you,
remarking all the time in an Emma Eames tone of voice: &ldquo;Oh, oo&rsquo;s um oodlum, doodlum,
woodlum, toodlum, bitsy- witsy skoodlums?&rdquo;
From a pedigreed yellow pup I grew up to be an anonymous yellow cur looking like a
cross between an Angora cat and a box of lemons. But my mistress never tumbled. She
thought that the two primeval pups that Noah chased into the ark were but a collateral
branch of my ancestors. It took two policemen to keep her from entering me at the Madison
Square Garden for the Siberian bloodhound prize.
I&rsquo;ll tell you about that flat. The house was the ordinary thing in New York, paved with
Parian marble in the entrance hall and cobblestones above the first floor. Our fiat was
three&ndash;well, not flights&ndash;climbs up. My mistress rented it unfurnished, and put in the regular
things&ndash;1903 antique unholstered parlour set, oil chromo of geishas in a Harlem tea house,
rubber plant and husband.
By Sirius! there was a biped I felt sorry for. He was a little man with sandy hair and
whiskers a good deal like mine. Henpecked?&ndash; well, toucans and flamingoes and pelicans all
had their bills in him. He wiped the dishes and listened to my mistress tell about the cheap,
ragged things the lady with the squirrel-skin coat on the second floor hung out on her line todry. And every evening while she was getting supper she made him take me out on the end
of a string for a walk.

half an hour&rsquo;s talk with the iceman, reading a package of old letters, a couple of pickles and
two bottles of malt extract, one hour peeking through a hole in the window shade into the
flat across the air-shaft&ndash;that&rsquo;s about all there is to it. Twenty minutes before time for him to
come home from work she straightens up the house, fixes her rat so it won&rsquo;t show, and gets
out a lot of sewing for a ten-minute bluff.
I led a dog&rsquo;s life in that flat. &lsquo;Most all day I lay there in my corner watching that fat
woman kill time. I slept sometimes and had pipe dreams about being out chasing cats into
basements and growling at old ladies with black mittens, as a dog was intended to do. Then
she would pounce upon me with a lot of that drivelling poodle palaver and kiss me on the
nose&ndash;but what could I do? A dog can&rsquo;t chew cloves.
I began to feel sorry for Hubby, dog my cats if I didn&rsquo;t. We looked so much alike that
people noticed it when we went out; so we shook the streets that Morgan&rsquo;s cab drives down,
and took to climbing the piles of last December&rsquo;s snow on the streets where cheap people
live.
One evening when we were thus promenading, and I was trying to look like a prize St.
Bernard, and the old man was trying to look like he wouldn&rsquo;t have murdered the first
organ-grinder he heard play Mendelssohn&rsquo;s wedding-march, I looked up at him and said, in
my way:
&ldquo;What are you looking so sour about, you oakum trimmed lobster? She don&rsquo;t kiss you.
You don&rsquo;t have to sit on her lap and listen to talk that would make the book of a musical
comedy sound like the maxims of Epictetus. You ought to be thankful you&rsquo;re not a dog. Brace
up, Benedick, and bid the blues begone.&rdquo;
The matrimonial mishap looked down at me with almost canine intelligence in his face.
&ldquo;Why, doggie,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;good doggie. You almost look like you could speak. What is it,
doggie&ndash;Cats?&rdquo;
Cats! Could speak!
But, of course, he couldn&rsquo;t understand. Humans were denied the speech of animals.
The only common ground of communication upon which dogs and men can get together is
in fiction.In the flat across the hall from us lived a lady with a black-and-tan terrier. Her husband
strung it and took it out every evening, but he always came home cheerful and whistling.
One day I touched noses with the black-and-tan in the hall, and I struck him for an
elucidation.
&ldquo;See, here, Wiggle-and-Skip,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;you know that it ain&rsquo;t the nature of a real man to
play dry nurse to a dog in public. I never saw one leashed to a bow-wow yet that didn&rsquo;t look
like he&rsquo;d like to lick every other man that looked at him. But your boss comes in every day as
perky and set up as an amateur prestidigitator doing the egg trick. How does he do it? Don&rsquo;t
tell me he likes it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Him?&rdquo; says the black-and-tan. &ldquo;Why, he uses Nature&rsquo;s Own Remedy. He gets
spifflicated. At first when we go out he&rsquo;s as shy as the man on the steamer who would rather
play pedro when they make &lsquo;em all jackpots. By the time we&rsquo;ve been in eight saloons he
don&rsquo;t care whether the thing on the end of his line is a dog or a catfish. I&rsquo;ve lost two inches
of my tail trying to sidestep those swinging doors.&rdquo;
The pointer I got from that terrier&ndash;vaudeville please copy&ndash;set me to thinking.
One evening about 6 o&rsquo;clock my mistress ordered him to get busy and do the ozone act
for Lovey. I have concealed it until now, but that is what she called me. The black-and-tan
was called &ldquo;Tweetness.&rdquo; I consider that I have the bulge on him as far as you could chase a
rabbit. Still &ldquo;Lovey&rdquo; is something of a nomenclatural tin can on the tail of one&rsquo;s self respect.
At a quiet place on a safe street I tightened the line of my custodian in front of an
attractive, refined saloon. I made a dead- ahead scramble for the doors, whining like a dog in
the press despatches that lets the family know that little Alice is bogged while gathering lilies
in the brook.
&ldquo;Why, darn my eyes,&rdquo; says the old man, with a grin; &ldquo;darn my eyes if the
saffron-coloured son of a seltzer lemonade ain&rsquo;t asking me in to take a drink. Lemme
see&ndash;how long&rsquo;s it been since I saved shoe leather by keeping one foot on the foot-rest? I
believe I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&rdquo;
I knew I had him. Hot Scotches he took, sitting at a table. For an hour he kept the
Campbells coming. I sat by his side rapping for the waiter with my tail, and eating free lunch
such as mamma in her flat never equalled with her homemade truck bought at a
delicatessen store eight minutes before papa comes home.
When the products of Scotland were all exhausted except the rye bread the old man
unwound me from the table leg and played me outside like a fisherman plays a salmon. Out
there he took off my collar and threw it into the street.&ldquo;Poor doggie,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;good doggie. She shan&rsquo;t kiss you any more. &rsquo;S a darned shame.
Good doggie, go away and get run over by a street car and be happy.&rdquo;
I refused to leave. I leaped and frisked around the old man&rsquo;s legs happy as a pug on a
rug.
&ldquo;You old flea-headed woodchuck-chaser,&rdquo; I said to him&ndash;&ldquo;you moon- baying,
rabbit-pointing, eggstealing old beagle, can&rsquo;t you see that I don&rsquo;t want to leave you? Can&rsquo;t
you see that we&rsquo;re both Pups in the Wood and the missis is the cruel uncle after you with
the dish towel and me with the flea liniment and a pink bow to tie on my tail. Why not cut
that all out and be pards forever more?&rdquo;
Maybe you&rsquo;ll say he didn&rsquo;t understand&ndash;maybe he didn&rsquo;t. But he kind of got a grip on
the Hot Scotches, and stood still for a minute, thinking.
&ldquo;Doggie,&rdquo; says he, finally, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t live more than a dozen lives on this earth, and very
few of us live to be more than 300. If I ever see that flat any more I&rsquo;m a flat, and if you do
you&rsquo;re flatter; and that&rsquo;s no flattery. I&rsquo;m offering 60 to 1 that Westward Ho wins out by the
length of a dachshund.&rdquo;
There was no string, but I frolicked along with my master to the Twenty-third street
ferry. And the cats on the route saw reason to give thanks that prehensile claws had been
given them.
On the Jersey side my master said to a stranger who stood eating a currant bun:
&ldquo;Me and my doggie, we are bound for the Rocky Mountains.&rdquo;
But what pleased me most was when my old man pulled both of my ears until I howled,
and said:
&ldquo;You common, monkey-headed, rat-tailed, sulphur-coloured son of a door mat, do you
know what I&rsquo;m going to call you?&rdquo;
I thought of &ldquo;Lovey,&rdquo; and I whined dolefully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to call you &lsquo;Pete,&rsquo;&rdquo; says my master; and if I&rsquo;d had five tails I couldn&rsquo;t have
done enough wagging to do justice to the occasion.
The Missing Chord （O·Henry）___________________________________________
I stopped overnight at the sheep-ranch of Rush Kinney, on the Sandy Fork of the
Nueces. Mr. Kinney and I had been strangers up to the time when I called &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; at his
hitching-rack; but from that moment until my departure on the next morning we were,
according to the Texas code, undeniable friends.
After supper the ranchman and I lugged our chairs outside the two-room house, to its
floorless gallery roofed with chaparral and sacuista grass. With the rear legs of our chairs
sinking deep into the hardpacked loam, each of us reposed against an elm pillar of the
structure and smoked El Toro tobacco, while we wrangled amicably concerning the affairs of
the rest of the world.
As for conveying adequate conception of the engaging charm of that prairie evening,
despair waits upon it. It is a bold chronicler who will undertake the description of a Texas
night in the early spring. An inventory must suffice.
The ranch rested upon the summit of a lenient slope. The ambient prairie, diversified by
arroyos and murky patches of brush and pear, lay around us like a darkened bowl at the
bottom of which we reposed as dregs. Like a turquoise cover the sky pinned us there. The
miraculous air, heady with ozone and made memorably sweet by leagues of wild flowerets,
gave tang and savour to the breath. In the sky was a great, round, mellow searchlight which
we knew to be no moon, but the dark lantern of summer, who came to hunt northward the
cowering spring. In the nearest corral a flock of sheep lay silent until a groundless panic
would send a squad of them huddling together with a drumming rush. For other sounds a
shrill family of coyotes yapped beyond the shearing-pen, and whippoorwills twittered in the
long grass. But even these dissonances hardly rippled the clear torrent of the mocking-birds&rsquo;
notes that fell from a dozen neighbouring shrubs and trees. It would not have been
preposterous for one to tiptoe and essay to touch the stars, they hung so bright and
imminent.
Mr. Kinney&rsquo;s wife, a young and capable woman, we had left in the house. She remained
to busy herself with the domestic round of duties, in which I had observed that she seemed
to take a buoyant and contented pride. In one room we had supped. Presently, from the
other, as Kinney and I sat without, there burst a volume of sudden and brilliant music. If I
could justly estimate the art of piano-playing, the construer of that rollicking fantasia had
creditably mastered the secrets of the keyboard. A piano, and one so well played, seemed to
me to be an unusual thing to find in that small and unpromising ranch- house. I must have
looked my surprise at Rush Kinney, for he laughed in his soft, Southern way, and nodded at
me through the moonlit haze of our cigarettes.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t often hear as agreeable a noise as that on a sheep-ranch,&rdquo; he remarked;
&ldquo;but I never see any reason for not playing up to the arts and graces just because we happento live out in the brush. It&rsquo;s a lonesome life for a woman; and if a little music can make it any
better, why not have it? That&rsquo;s the way I look at it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A wise and generous theory,&rdquo; I assented. &ldquo;And Mrs. Kinney plays well. I am not learned
in the science of music, but I should call her an uncommonly good performer. She has
technic and more than ordinary power.&rdquo;
The moon was very bright, you will understand, and I saw upon Kinney&rsquo;s face a sort of
amused and pregnant expression, as though there were things behind it that might be
expounded.
&ldquo;You came up the trail from the Double-Elm Fork,&rdquo; he said promisingly. &ldquo;As you crossed
it you must have seen an old deserted jacal to your left under a comma mott.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;There was a drove of javalis rooting around it. I could see by the broken
corrals that no one lived there.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where this music proposition started,&rdquo; said Kinney. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you
about it while we smoke. That&rsquo;s where old Cal Adams lived. He had about eight hundred
graded merinos and a daughter that was solid silk and as handsome as a new stake-rope on
a thirty-dollar pony. And I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that I was guilty in the second degree of
hanging around old Cal&rsquo;s ranch all the time I could spare away from lambing and shearing.
Miss Marilla was her name; and I had figured it out by the rule of two that she was destined
to become the chatelaine and lady superior of Rancho Lomito, belonging to R. Kinney, Esq.,
where you are now a welcome and honoured guest.
&ldquo;I will say that old Cal wasn&rsquo;t distinguished as a sheepman. He was a little, old
stoop-shouldered hombre about as big as a gun scabbard, with scraggy white whiskers, and
condemned to the continuous use of language. Old Cal was so obscure in his chosen
profession that he wasn&rsquo;t even hated by the cowmen. And when a sheepman don&rsquo;t get
eminent enough to acquire the hostility of the cattlemen, he is mighty apt to die unwept
and considerably unsung.
&ldquo;But that Marilla girl was a benefit to the eye. And she was the most elegant kind of a
housekeeper. I was the nearest neighbour, and I used to ride over to the Double-Elm
anywhere from nine to sixteen times a week with fresh butter or a quarter of venison or a
sample of new sheep-dip just as a frivolous excuse to see Marilla. Marilla and me got to be
extensively inveigled with each other, and I was pretty sure I was going to get my rope
around her neck and lead her over to the Lomito. Only she was so everlastingly permeated
with filial sentiments toward old Cal that I never could get her to talk about serious matters.
&ldquo;You never saw anybody in your life that was as full of knowledge and had less sense
than old Cal. He was advised about all the branches of information contained in learning,
and he was up to all the rudiments of doctrines and enlightenment. You couldn&rsquo;t advancehim any ideas on any of the parts of speech or lines of thought. You would have thought he
was a professor of the weather and politics and chemistry and natural history and the origin
of derivations. Any subject you brought up old Cal could give you an abundant synopsis of it
from the Greek root up to the time it was sacked and on the market.
&ldquo;One day just after the fall shearing I rides over to the Double-Elm with a lady&rsquo;s
magazine about fashions for Marilla and a scientific paper for old Cal.
&ldquo;While I was tying my pony to a mesquite, out runs Marilla, &lsquo;tickled to death&rsquo; with some
news that couldn&rsquo;t wait.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, Rush,&rsquo; she says, all flushed up with esteem and gratification, &lsquo;what do you think!
Dad&rsquo;s going to buy me a piano. Ain&rsquo;t it grand? I never dreamed I&rsquo;d ever have one.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s sure joyful,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I always admired the agreeable uproar of a piano. It&rsquo;ll be lots of
company for you. That&rsquo;s mighty good of Uncle Cal to do that.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m all undecided,&rsquo; says Marilla, &lsquo;between a piano and an organ. A parlour organ is
nice.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Either of &lsquo;em,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;is first-class for mitigating the lack of noise around a
sheep-ranch. For my part,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like anything better than to ride home of an
evening and listen to a few waltzes and jigs, with somebody about your size sitting on the
piano- stool and rounding up the notes.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, hush about that,&rsquo; says Marilla, &lsquo;and go on in the house. Dad hasn&rsquo;t rode out to-day.
He&rsquo;s not feeling well.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Old Cal was inside, lying on a cot. He had a pretty bad cold and cough. I stayed to
supper.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Going to get Marilla a piano, I hear,&rsquo; says I to him.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, yes, something of the kind, Rush,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s been hankering for music for a
long spell; and I allow to fix her up with something in that line right away. The sheep sheared
six pounds all round this fall; and I&rsquo;m going to get Marilla an instrument if it takes the price
of the whole clip to do it.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Star wayno,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;The little girl deserves it.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to San Antone on the last load of wool,&rsquo; says Uncle Cal, &lsquo;and select an
instrument for her myself.&lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better,&rsquo; I suggests, &lsquo;to take Marilla along and let her pick out one that
she likes?&rsquo;
&ldquo;I might have known that would set Uncle Cal going. Of course, a man like him, that
knew everything about everything, would look at that as a reflection on his attainments.
&ldquo;&lsquo;No, sir, it wouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; says he, pulling at his white whiskers. &lsquo;There ain&rsquo;t a better judge of
musical instruments in the whole world than what I am. I had an uncle,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;that was a
partner in a piano-factory, and I&rsquo;ve seen thousands of &lsquo;em put together. I know all about
musical instruments from a pipe-organ to a corn-stalk fiddle. There ain&rsquo;t a man lives, sir, that
can tell me any news about any instrument that has to be pounded, blowed, scraped,
grinded, picked, or wound with a key.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;You get me what you like, dad,&rsquo; says Marilla, who couldn&rsquo;t keep her feet on the floor
from joy. &lsquo;Of course you know what to select. I&rsquo;d just as lief it was a piano or a organ or
what.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I see in St. Louis once what they call a orchestrion,&rsquo; says Uncle Cal, &lsquo;that I judged was
about the finest thing in the way of music ever invented. But there ain&rsquo;t room in this house
for one. Anyway, I imagine they&rsquo;d cost a thousand dollars. I reckon something in the piano
line would suit Marilla the best. She took lessons in that respect for two years over at
Birdstail. I wouldn&rsquo;t trust the buying of an instrument to anybody else but myself. I reckon if I
hadn&rsquo;t took up sheep-raising I&rsquo;d have been one of the finest composers or piano- and-organ
manufacturers in the world.&rsquo;
&ldquo;That was Uncle Cal&rsquo;s style. But I never lost any patience with him, on account of his
thinking so much of Marilla. And she thought just as much of him. He sent her to the
academy over at Birdstail for two years when it took nearly every pound of wool to pay the
expenses.
&ldquo;Along about Tuesday Uncle Cal put out for San Antone on the last wagonload of wool.
Marilla&rsquo;s uncle Ben, who lived in Birdstail, come over and stayed at the ranch while Uncle Cal
was gone.
&ldquo;It was ninety miles to San Antone, and forty to the nearest railroad- station, so Uncle
Cal was gone about four days. I was over at the Double-Elm when he came rolling back one
evening about sundown. And up there in the wagon, sure enough, was a piano or a
organ&ndash;we couldn&rsquo;t tell which&ndash;all wrapped up in woolsacks, with a wagon-sheet tied over it
in case of rain. And out skips Marilla, hollering, &lsquo;Oh, oh!&rsquo; with her eyes shining and her hair
a-flying. &lsquo;Dad&ndash;dad,&rsquo; she sings out, &lsquo;have you brought it&ndash;have you brought it?&rsquo;&ndash;and it right
there before her eyes, as women will do.&ldquo;&lsquo;Finest piano in San Antone,&rsquo; says Uncle Cal, waving his hand, proud. &lsquo;Genuine
rosewood, and the finest, loudest tone you ever listened to. I heard the storekeeper play it,
and I took it on the spot and paid cash down.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Me and Ben and Uncle Cal and a Mexican lifted it out of the wagon and carried it in
the house and set it in a corner. It was one of them upright instruments, and not very heavy
or very big.
&ldquo;And then all of a sudden Uncle Cal flops over and says he&rsquo;s mighty sick. He&rsquo;s got a high
fever, and he complains of his lungs. He gets into bed, while me and Ben goes out to unhitch
and put the horses in the pasture, and Marilla flies around to get Uncle Cal something hot to
drink. But first she puts both arms on that piano and hugs it with a soft kind of a smile, like
you see kids doing with their Christmas toys.
&ldquo;When I came in from the pasture, Marilla was in the room where the piano was. I
could see by the strings and woolsacks on the floor that she had had it unwrapped. But now
she was tying the wagon-sheet over it again, and there was a kind of solemn, whitish look on
her face.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t wrapping up the music again, are you, Marilla?&rsquo; I asks. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with
just a couple of tunes for to see how she goes under the saddle?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Not to-night, Rush,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to play any to-night. Dad&rsquo;s too sick. Just
think, Rush, he paid three hundred dollars for it &ndash;nearly a third of what the wool-clip
brought!&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t anyways in the neighbourhood of a third of what you are worth,&rsquo; I told
her. &lsquo;And I don&rsquo;t think Uncle Cal is too sick to hear a little agitation of the piano-keys just to
christen the machine.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Not to-night, Rush,&rsquo; says Marilla, in a way that she had when she wanted to settle
things.
&ldquo;But it seems that Uncle Cal was plenty sick, after all. He got so bad that Ben saddled up
and rode over to Birdstail for Doc Simpson. I stayed around to see if I&rsquo;d be needed for
anything.
&ldquo;When Uncle Cal&rsquo;s pain let up on him a little he called Marilla and says to her: &lsquo;Did you
look at your instrument, honey? And do you like it?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s lovely, dad,&rsquo; says she, leaning down by his pillow; &lsquo;I never saw one so pretty. How
dear and good it was of you to buy it for me!&lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard you play on it any yet,&rsquo; says Uncle Cal; &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ve been listening. My side
don&rsquo;t hurt quite so bad now&ndash;won&rsquo;t you play a piece, Marilla?&rsquo;
&ldquo;But no; she puts Uncle Cal off and soothes him down like you&rsquo;ve seen women do with
a kid. It seems she&rsquo;s made up her mind not to touch that piano at present.
&ldquo;When Doc Simpson comes over he tells us that Uncle Cal has pneumonia the worst
kind; and as the old man was past sixty and nearly on the lift anyhow, the odds was against
his walking on grass any more.
&ldquo;On the fourth day of his sickness he calls for Marilla again and wants to talk piano. Doc
Simpson was there, and so was Ben and Mrs. Ben, trying to do all they could.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d have made a wonderful success in anything connected with music,&rsquo; says Uncle Cal.
&lsquo;I got the finest instrument for the money in San Antone. Ain&rsquo;t that piano all right in every
respect, Marilla?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s just perfect, dad,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s got the finest tone I ever heard. But don&rsquo;t you
think you could sleep a little while now, dad?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; says Uncle Cal. &lsquo;I want to hear that piano. I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve even tried
it yet. I went all the way to San Antone and picked it out for you myself. It took a third of the
fall clip to buy it; but I don&rsquo;t mind that if it makes my good girl happier. Won&rsquo;t you play a little
bit for dad, Marilla?&rsquo;
&ldquo;Doc Simpson beckoned Marilla to one side and recommended her to do what Uncle
Cal wanted, so it would get him quieted. And her uncle Ben and his wife asked her, too.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Why not hit out a tune or two with the soft pedal on?&rsquo; I asks Marilla. &lsquo;Uncle Cal has
begged you so often. It would please him a good deal to hear you touch up the piano he&rsquo;s
bought for you. Don&rsquo;t you think you might?&rsquo;
&ldquo;But Marilla stands there with big tears rolling down from her eyes and says nothing.
And then she runs over and slips her arm under Uncle Cal&rsquo;s neck and hugs him tight.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, last night, dad,&rsquo; we heard her say, &lsquo;I played it ever so much. Honest&ndash;I have been
playing it. And it&rsquo;s such a splendid instrument, you don&rsquo;t know how I love it. Last night I
played &ldquo;Bonnie Dundee&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Anvil Polka&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Blue Danube&rdquo;&ndash;and lots of pieces.
You must surely have heard me playing a little, didn&rsquo;t you, dad? I didn&rsquo;t like to play loud
when you was so sick.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; says Uncle Cal, &lsquo;maybe I did. Maybe I did and forgot about it. My head is a
little cranky at times. I heard the man in the store play it fine. I&rsquo;m mighty glad you like it,
Marilla. Yes, I believe I could go to sleep a while if you&rsquo;ll stay right beside me till I do.&lsquo;&ldquo;There was where Marilla had me guessing. Much as she thought of that old man, she
wouldn&rsquo;t strike a note on that piano that he&rsquo;d bought her. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine why she told
him she&rsquo;d been playing it, for the wagon-sheet hadn&rsquo;t ever been off of it since she put it back
on the same day it come. I knew she could play a little anyhow, for I&rsquo;d once heard her snatch
some pretty fair dance-music out of an old piano at the Charco Largo Ranch.
&ldquo;Well, in about a week the pneumonia got the best of Uncle Cal. They had the funeral
over at Birdstail, and all of us went over. I brought Marilla back home in my buckboard. Her
uncle Ben and his wife were going to stay there a few days with her.
&ldquo;That night Marilla takes me in the room where the piano was, while the others were
out on the gallery.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Come here, Rush,&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;I want you to see this now.&rsquo;
&ldquo;She unties the rope, and drags off the wagon-sheet.
&ldquo;If you ever rode a saddle without a horse, or fired off a gun that wasn&rsquo;t loaded, or took
a drink out of an empty bottle, why, then you might have been able to scare an opera or two
out of the instrument Uncle Cal had bought.
&ldquo;Instead of a piano, it was one of the machines they&rsquo;ve invented to play the piano with.
By itself it was about as musical as the holes of a flute without the flute.
&ldquo;And that was the piano that Uncle Cal had selected; and standing by it was the good,
fine, all-wool girl that never let him know it.
&ldquo;And what you heard playing a while ago,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Kinney, &ldquo;was that same
deputy-piano machine; only just at present it&rsquo;s shoved up against a six-hundred-dollar piano
that I bought for Marilla as soon as we was married.&rdquo;
The Moment of Victory （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Ben Granger is a war veteran aged twenty-nine&ndash;which should enable you to guess the
war. He is also principal merchant and postmaster of Cadiz, a little town over which the
breezes from the Gulf of Mexico perpetually blow.
Ben helped to hurl the Don from his stronghold in the Greater Antilles; and then, hiking
across half the world, he marched as a corporal-usher up and down the blazing tropic aislesof the open-air college in which the Filipino was schooled. Now, with his bayonet beaten
into a cheese-slicer, he rallies his corporal&rsquo;s guard of cronies in the shade of his well-whittled
porch, instead of in the matted jungles of Mindanao. Always have his interest and choice
been for deeds rather than for words; but the consideration and digestion of motives is not
beyond him, as this story, which is his, will attest.
&ldquo;What is it,&rdquo; he asked me one moonlit eve, as we sat among his boxes and barrels, &ldquo;that
generally makes men go through dangers, and fire, and trouble, and starvation, and battle,
and such rucouses? What does a man do it for? Why does he try to outdo his fellow-humans,
and be braver and stronger and more daring and showy than even his best friends are?
What&rsquo;s his game? What does he expect to get out of it? He don&rsquo;t do it just for the fresh air
and exercise. What would you say, now, Bill, that an ordinary man expects, generally
speaking, for his efforts along the line of ambition and extraordinary hustling in the
marketplaces, forums, shooting-galleries, lyceums, battle-fields, links, cinder-paths, and
arenas of the civilized and vice versa places of the world?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, Ben,&rdquo; said I, with judicial seriousness, &ldquo;I think we might safely limit the number
of motives of a man who seeks fame to three-to ambition, which is a desire for popular
applause; to avarice, which looks to the material side of success; and to love of some
woman whom he either possesses or desires to possess.&rdquo;
Ben pondered over my words while a mocking-bird on the top of a mesquite by the
porch trilled a dozen bars.
&ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that your diagnosis about covers the case according to the rules
laid down in the copy-books and historical readers. But what I had in my mind was the case
of Willie Robbins, a person I used to know. I&rsquo;ll tell you about him before I close up the store,
if you don&rsquo;t mind listening.
&ldquo;Willie was one of our social set up in San Augustine. I was clerking there then for
Brady &amp; Murchison, wholesale dry-goods and ranch supplies. Willie and I belonged to the
same german club and athletic association and military company. He played the triangle in
our serenading and quartet crowd that used to ring the welkin three nights a week
somewhere in town.
&ldquo;Willie jibed with his name considerable. He weighed about as much as a hundred
pounds of veal in his summer suitings, and he had a &lsquo;where- is-Mary?&rsquo; expression on his
features so plain that you could almost see the wool growing on him.
&ldquo;And yet you couldn&rsquo;t fence him away from the girls with barbed wire. You know that
kind of young fellows-a kind of a mixture of fools and angels-they rush in and fear to tread at
the same time; but they never fail to tread when they get the chance. He was always on
hand when &lsquo;a joyful occasion was had,&rsquo; as the morning paper would say, looking as happy as
a king full, and at the same time as uncomfortable as a raw oyster served with sweet pickles.He danced like he had hind hobbles on; and he had a vocabulary of about three hundred and
fifty words that he made stretch over four germans a week, and plagiarized from to get him
through two ice-cream suppers and a Sunday-night call. He seemed to me to be a sort of a
mixture of Maltese kitten, sensitive plant, and a member of a stranded Two Orphans
company.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you an estimate of his physiological and pictorial make-up, and then I&rsquo;ll stick
spurs into the sides of my narrative.
&ldquo;Willie inclined to the Caucasian in his coloring and manner of style. His hair was
opalescent and his conversation fragmentary. His eyes were the same blue shade as the
china dog&rsquo;s on the right-hand corner of your Aunt Ellen&rsquo;s mantelpiece. He took things as
they come, and I never felt any hostility against him. I let him live, and so did others.
&ldquo;But what does this Willie do but coax his heart out of his boots and lose it to Myra
Allison, the liveliest, brightest, keenest, smartest, and prettiest girl in San Augustine. I tell
you, she had the blackest eyes, the shiniest curls, and the most tantalizing&ndash; Oh, no, you&rsquo;re
off&ndash;I wasn&rsquo;t a victim. I might have been, but I knew better. I kept out. Joe Granberry was It
from the start. He had everybody else beat a couple of leagues and thence east to a stake
and mound. But, anyhow, Myra was a nine-pound, full-merino, fall-clip fleece, sacked and
loaded on a four-horse team for San Antone.
&ldquo;One night there was an ice-cream sociable at Mrs. Colonel Spraggins&rsquo;, in San Augustine.
We fellows had a big room up-stairs opened up for us to put our hats and things in, and to
comb our hair and put on the clean collars we brought along inside the sweat-bands of our
hats-in short, a room to fix up in just like they have everywhere at high-toned doings. A little
farther down the hall was the girls&rsquo; room, which they used to powder up in, and so forth.
Downstairs we&ndash;that is, the San Augustine Social Cotillion and Merrymakers&rsquo; Club&ndash;had a
stretcher put down in the parlor where our dance was going on.
&ldquo;Willie Robbins and me happened to be up in our&ndash;cloak-room, I believe we called it
when Myra Allison skipped through the hall on her way down-stairs from the girls&rsquo; room.
Willie was standing before the mirror, deeply interested in smoothing down the blond
grass-plot on his head, which seemed to give him lots of trouble. Myra was always full of life
and devilment. She stopped and stuck her head in our door. She certainly was good-looking.
But I knew how Joe Granberry stood with her. So did Willie; but he kept on ba-a-a-ing after
her and following her around. He had a system of persistence that didn&rsquo;t coincide with pale
hair and light eyes.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Hello, Willie!&rsquo; says Myra. &lsquo;What are you doing to yourself in the glass?&rsquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to look fly,&rsquo; says Willie.&rdquo;&lsquo;Well, you never could be fly,&rsquo; says Myra, with her special laugh, which was the
provokingest sound I ever heard except the rattle of an empty canteen against my
saddle-horn.
&ldquo;I looked around at Willie after Myra had gone. He had a kind of a lily-white look on
him which seemed to show that her remark had, as you might say, disrupted his soul. I never
noticed anything in what she said that sounded particularly destructive to a man&rsquo;s ideas of
self-consciousness; but he was set back to an extent you could scarcely imagine.
&ldquo;After we went down-stairs with our clean collars on, Willie never went near Myra
again that night. After all, he seemed to be a diluted kind of a skim-milk sort of a chap, and I
never wondered that Joe Granberry beat him out.
&ldquo;The next day the battleship Maine was blown up, and then pretty soon somebody-I
reckon it was Joe Bailey, or Ben Tillman, or maybe the Government-declared war against
Spain.
&ldquo;Well, everybody south of Mason &amp; Hamlin&rsquo;s line knew that the North by itself couldn&rsquo;t
whip a whole country the size of Spain. So the Yankees commenced to holler for help, and
the Johnny Rebs answered the call. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re coming, Father William, a hundred thousand
strong&ndash;and then some,&rsquo; was the way they sang it. And the old party lines drawn by
Sherman&rsquo;s march and the Kuklux and nine-cent cotton and the Jim Crow street-car
ordinances faded away. We became one undivided. country, with no North, very little East, a
good-sized chunk of West, and a South that loomed up as big as the first foreign label on a
new eight-dollar suit-case.
&ldquo;Of course the dogs of war weren&rsquo;t a complete pack without a yelp from the San
Augustine Rifles, Company D, of the Fourteenth Texas Regiment. Our company was among
the first to land in Cuba and strike terror into the hearts of the foe. I&rsquo;m not going to give you
a history of the war, I&rsquo;m just dragging it in to fill out my story about Willie Robbins, just as
the Republican party dragged it in to help out the election in 1898.
&ldquo;If anybody ever had heroitis, it was that Willie Robbins. From the minute he set foot
on the soil of the tyrants of Castile he seemed to engulf danger as a cat laps up cream. He
certainly astonished every man in our company, from the captain up. You&rsquo;d have expected
him to gravitate naturally to the job of an orderly to the colonel, or typewriter in the
commissary&ndash;but not any. He created the part of the flaxen-haired boy hero who lives and
gets back home with the goods, instead of dying with an important despatch in his hands at
his colonel&rsquo;s feet.
&ldquo;Our company got into a section of Cuban scenery where one of the messiest and most
unsung portions of the campaign occurred. We were out every day capering around in the
bushes, and having little skirmishes with the Spanish troops that looked more like kind of
tired-out feuds than anything else. The war was a joke to us, and of no interest to them. Wenever could see it any other way than as a howling farce-comedy that the San Augustine
Rifles were actually fighting to uphold the Stars and Stripes. And the blamed little senors
didn&rsquo;t get enough pay to make them care whether they were patriots or traitors. Now and
then somebody would get killed. It seemed like a waste of life to me. I was at Coney Island
when I went to New York once, and one of them down-hill skidding apparatuses they call
&lsquo;roller-coasters&rsquo; flew the track and killed a man in a brown sack-suit. Whenever the
Spaniards shot one of our men, it struck me as just about as unnecessary and regrettable as
that was.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m dropping Willie Robbins out of the conversation.
&ldquo;He was out for bloodshed, laurels, ambition, medals, recommendations, and all other
forms of military glory. And he didn&rsquo;t seem to be afraid of any of the recognized forms of
military danger, such as Spaniards, cannon-balls, canned beef, gunpowder, or nepotism. He
went forth with his pallid hair and china-blue eyes and ate up Spaniards like you would
sardines a la canopy. Wars and rumbles of wars never flustered him. He would stand
guard-duty, mosquitoes, hardtack, treat, and fire with equally perfect unanimity. No blondes
in history ever come in comparison distance of him except the Jack of Diamonds and Queen
Catherine of Russia.
&ldquo;I remember, one time, a little caballard of Spanish men sauntered out from behind a
patch of sugar-cane and shot Bob Turner, the first sergeant of our company, while we were
eating dinner. As required by the army regulations, we fellows went through the usual
tactics of falling into line, saluting the enemy, and loading and firing, kneeling.
&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t the Texas way of scrapping; but, being a very important addendum and
annex to the regular army, the San Augustine Rifles had to conform to the red-tape system
of getting even.
&ldquo;By the time we had got out our &lsquo;Upton&rsquo;s Tactics,&rsquo; turned to page fifty-seven, said
&lsquo;one&ndash;two&ndash;three&ndash;one&ndash;two&ndash;three&rsquo; a couple of times, and got blank cartridges into our
Springfields, the Spanish outfit had smiled repeatedly, rolled and lit cigarettes by squads, and
walked away contemptuously.
&ldquo;I went straight to Captain Floyd, and says to him: &lsquo;Sam, I don&rsquo;t think this war is a
straight game. You know as well as I do that Bob Turner was one of the whitest fellows that
ever threw a leg over a saddle, and now these wirepullers in Washington have fixed his clock.
He&rsquo;s politically and ostensibly dead. It ain&rsquo;t fair. Why should they keep this thing up? If they
want Spain licked, why don&rsquo;t they turn the San Augustine Rifles and Joe Seely&rsquo;s ranger
company and a car-load of West Texas deputy-sheriffs onto these Spaniards, and let us
exonerate them from the face of the earth? I never did,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;care much about fighting by
the Lord Chesterfield ring rules. I&rsquo;m going to hand in my resignation and go home if anybody
else I am personally acquainted with gets hurt in this war. If you can get somebody in my
place, Sam,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll quit the first of next week. I don&rsquo;t want to work in an army that don&rsquo;tgive its help a chance. Never mind my wages,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;let the Secretary of the Treasury keep
&lsquo;em.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Ben,&rsquo; says the captain to me, &lsquo;your allegations and estimations of the tactics of
war, government, patriotism, guard- mounting, and democracy are all right. But I&rsquo;ve looked
into the system of international arbitration and the ethics of justifiable slaughter a little
closer, maybe, than you have. Now, you can hand in your resignation the first of next week if
you are so minded. But if you do,&rsquo; says Sam, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll order a corporal&rsquo;s guard to take you over by
that limestone bluff on the creek and shoot enough lead into you to ballast a submarine
air-ship. I&rsquo;m captain of this company, and I&rsquo;ve swore allegiance to the Amalgamated States
regardless of sectional, secessional, and Congressional differences. Have you got any
smoking- tobacco?&rsquo; winds up Sam. &lsquo;Mine got wet when I swum the creek this morning.&rsquo;
&ldquo;The reason I drag all this non ex parte evidence in is because Willie Robbins was
standing there listening to us. I was a second sergeant and he was a private then, but among
us Texans and Westerners there never was as much tactics and subordination as there was in
the regular army. We never called our captain anything but &lsquo;Sam&rsquo; except when there was a
lot of major-generals and admirals around, so as to preserve the discipline.
&ldquo;And says Willie Robbins to me, in a sharp construction of voice much unbecoming to
his light hair and previous record:
&ldquo;&lsquo;You ought to be shot, Ben, for emitting any such sentiments. A man that won&rsquo;t fight
for his country is worse than a, horse-thief. If I was the cap, I&rsquo;d put you in the guard-house
for thirty days on round steak and tamales. War,&rsquo; says Willie, &lsquo;is great and glorious. I didn&rsquo;t
know you were a coward.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;If I was, I&rsquo;d knock some of the pallidness off of your marble brow. I&rsquo;m
lenient with you,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;just as I am with the Spaniards, because you have always reminded
me of something with mushrooms on the side. Why, you little Lady of Shalott,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;you
underdone leader of cotillions, you glassy fashion and moulded form, you white-pine soldier
made in the Cisalpine Alps in Germany for the late New-Year trade, do you know of whom
you are talking to? We&rsquo;ve been in the same social circle,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ve put up with you
because you seemed so meek and self-un-satisfying. I don&rsquo;t understand why you have so
sudden taken a personal interest in chivalrousness and murder. Your nature&rsquo;s undergone a
complete revelation. Now, how is it?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t understand, Ben,&rsquo; says Willie, giving one of his refined smiles and
turning away.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Come back here!&rsquo; says I, catching him by the tail of his khaki coat. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve made me
kind of mad, in spite of the aloofness in which I have heretofore held you. You are out for
making a success in this hero business, and I believe I know what for. You are doing it eitherbecause you are crazy or because you expect to catch some girl by it. Now, if it&rsquo;s a girl, I&rsquo;ve
got something here to show you.&rsquo;
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it, but I was plumb mad. I pulled a San Augustine paper out of
my hip-pocket, and showed him an item. It was a half a column about the marriage of Myra
Allison and Joe Granberry.
&ldquo;Willie laughed, and I saw I hadn&rsquo;t touched him.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;everybody knew that was going to happen. I heard about that a week
ago.&rsquo; And then he gave me the laugh again.
&ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Then why do you so recklessly chase the bright rainbow of fame? Do
you expect to be elected President, or do you belong to a suicide club ?&rsquo;
&ldquo;And then Captain Sam interferes.
&ldquo;&lsquo;You gentlemen quit jawing and go back to your quarters,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;or I&rsquo;ll have you
escorted to the guard-house. Now, scat, both of you! Before you go, which one of you has
got any chewing-tobacco?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re off, Sam,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s supper-time, anyhow. But what do you think of what we
was talking about? I&rsquo;ve noticed you throwing out a good many grappling-hooks for this here
balloon called fame&ndash; What&rsquo;s ambition, anyhow? What does a man risk his life day after day
for? Do you know of anything he gets in the end that can pay him for the trouble? I want to
go back home,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether Cuba sinks or swims, and I don&rsquo;t give a pipeful of
rabbit tobacco whether Queen Sophia Christina or Charlie Culberson rules these fairy isles;
and I don&rsquo;t want my name on any list except the list of survivors. But I&rsquo;ve noticed you, Sam,&rsquo;
says I, &lsquo;seeking the bubble notoriety in the cannon&rsquo;s larynx a number of times. Now, what do
you do it for? Is it ambition, business, or some freckle-faced Pheebe at home that you are
heroing for ?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Ben,&rsquo; says Sam, kind of hefting his sword out from between his knees, &lsquo;as your
superior officer I could court-martial you for attempted cowardice and desertion. But I won&rsquo;t.
And I&rsquo;ll tell you why I&rsquo;m trying for promotion and the usual honors of war and conquest. A
major gets more pay than a captain, and I need the money.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Correct for you!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I can understand that. Your system of fame-seeking is rooted
in the deepest soil of patriotism. But I can&rsquo;t comprehend,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;why Willie Robbins, whose
folks at home are well off, and who used to be as meek and undesirous of notice as a cat
with cream on his whiskers, should all at once develop into a warrior bold with the most
fire-eating kind of proclivities. And the girl in his case seems to have been eliminated by
marriage to another fellow. I reckon,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a plain case of just common ambition. He
wants his name, maybe, to go thundering down the coroners of time. It must be that.&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, without itemizing his deeds, Willie sure made good as a hero. He simply spent
most of his time on his knees begging our captain to send him on forlorn hopes and
dangerous scouting expeditions. In every fight he was the first man to mix it at close
quarters with the Don Alfonsos. He got three or four bullets planted in various parts of his
autonomy. Once he went off with a detail of eight men and captured a whole company of
Spanish. He kept Captain Floyd busy writing out recommendations of his bravery to send in
to head- quarters; and he began to accumulate medals for all kinds of things- heroism and
target-shooting and valor and tactics and uninsubordination, and all the little
accomplishments that look good to the third assistant secretaries of the War Department.
&ldquo;Finally, Cap Floyd got promoted to be a major-general, or a knight commander of the
main herd, or something like that. He pounded around on a white horse, all desecrated up
with gold-leaf and hen-feathers and a Good Templar&rsquo;s hat, and wasn&rsquo;t allowed by the
regulations to speak to us. And Willie Robbins was made captain of our company.
&ldquo;And maybe he didn&rsquo;t go after the wreath of fame then! As far as I could see it was him
that ended the war. He got eighteen of us boys&ndash; friends of his, too&ndash;killed in battles that he
stirred up himself, and that didn&rsquo;t seem to me necessary at all. One night he took twelve of
us and waded through a little nil about a hundred and ninety yards wide, and climbed a
couple of mountains, and sneaked through a mile of neglected shrubbery and a couple of
rock-quarries and into a rye-straw village, and captured a Spanish general named, as they
said, Benny Veedus. Benny seemed to me hardly worth the trouble, being a blackish man
without shoes or cuffs, and anxious to surrender and throw himself on the commissary of
his foe.
&ldquo;But that job gave Willie the big boost he wanted. The San Augustine News and the
Galveston, St. Louis, New York, and Kansas City papers printed his picture and columns of
stuff about him. Old San Augustine simply went crazy over its &lsquo;gallant son.&rsquo; The News had an
editorial tearfully begging the Government to call off the regular army and the national
guard, and let Willie carry on the rest of the war single- handed. It said that a refusal to do
so would be regarded as a proof that the Northern jealousy of the South was still as rampant
as ever.
&ldquo;If the war hadn&rsquo;t ended pretty soon, I don&rsquo;t know to what heights of gold braid and
encomiums Willie would have climbed; but it did. There was a secession of hostilities just
three days after he was appointed a colonel, and got in three more medals by registered
mail, and shot two Spaniards while they were drinking lemonade in an ambuscade.
&ldquo;Our company went back to San Augustine when the war was over. There wasn&rsquo;t
anywhere else for it to go. And what do you think? The old town notified us in print, by wire
cable, special delivery, and a nigger named Saul sent on a gray mule to San Antone, that they
was going to give us the biggest blow-out, complimentary, alimentary, and elementary, that
ever disturbed the kildees on the sand-flats outside of the immediate contiguity of the city.&ldquo;I say &lsquo;we,&rsquo; but it was all meant for ex-Private, Captain de facto, and Colonel-elect Willie
Robbins. The town was crazy about him. They notified us that the reception they were going
to put up would make the Mardi Gras in New Orleans look like an afternoon tea in Bury St.
Edmunds with a curate&rsquo;s aunt.
&ldquo;Well, the San Augustine Rifles got back home on schedule time. Everybody was at the
depot giving forth Roosevelt-Democrat&ndash;they used to be called Rebel&ndash;yells. There was two
brass-bands, and the mayor, and schoolgirls in white frightening the street-car horses by
throwing Cherokee roses in the streets, and-well, maybe you&rsquo;ve seen a celebration by a
town that was inland and out of water.
&ldquo;They wanted Brevet-Colonel Willie to get into a carriage and be drawn by prominent
citizens and some of the city aldermen to the armory, but he stuck to his company and
marched at the head of it up Sam Houston Avenue. The buildings on both sides was covered
with flags and audiences, and everybody hollered &lsquo;Robbins!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Hello, Willie!&rsquo; as we
marched up in files of fours. I never saw a illustriouser-looking human in my life than Willie
was. He had at least seven or eight medals and diplomas and decorations on the breast of
his khaki coat; he was sunburnt the color of a saddle, and he certainly done himself proud.
&ldquo;They told us at the depot that the courthouse was to be illuminated at half-past seven,
and there would be speeches and chili-con-came at the Palace Hotel. Miss Delphine
Thompson was to read an original poem by James Whitcomb Ryan, and Constable Hooker
had promised us a salute of nine guns from Chicago that he had arrested that day.
&ldquo;After we had disbanded in the armory, Willie says to me:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Want to walk out a piece with me?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, yes,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;if it ain&rsquo;t so far that we can&rsquo;t hear the tumult and the shouting die
away. I&rsquo;m hungry myself,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m pining for some home grub, but I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Willie steered me down some side streets till we came to a little white cottage in a
new lot with a twenty-by-thirty-foot lawn decorated with brickbats and old barrel-staves.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Halt and give the countersign,&rsquo; says I to Willie. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know this dugout? It&rsquo;s the
bird&rsquo;s-nest that Joe Granberry built before he married Myra Allison. What you going there
for?&rsquo;
&ldquo;But Willie already had the gate open. He walked up the brick walk to the steps, and I
went with him. Myra was sitting in a rocking-chair on the porch, sewing. Her hair was
smoothed back kind of hasty and tied in a knot. I never noticed till then that she had freckles.
Joe was at one side of the porch, in his shirtsleeves, with no collar on, and no signs of ashave, trying to scrape out a hole among the brickbats and tin cans to plant a little fruit-tree
in. He looked up but never said a word, and neither did Myra.
&ldquo;Willie was sure dandy-looking in his uniform, with medals strung on his breast and his
new gold-handled sword. You&rsquo;d never have taken him for the little white-headed snipe that
the girls used to order about and make fun of. He just stood there for a minute, looking at
Myra with a peculiar little smile on his face; and then he says to her, slow, and kind of
holding on to his words with his teeth:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know! Maybe I could if I tried!&rsquo;
&ldquo;That was all that was said. Willie raised his hat, and we walked away.
&ldquo;And, somehow, when he said that, I remembered, all of a sudden, the night of that
dance and Willie brushing his hair before the looking- glass, and Myra sticking her head in
the door to guy him.
&ldquo;When we got back to Sam Houston Avenue, Willie says:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, so long, Ben. I&rsquo;m going down home and get off my shoes and take a rest.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;You?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Ain&rsquo;t the court-house jammed with
everybody in town waiting to honor the hero? And two brass-bands, and recitations and
flags and jags and grub to follow waiting for you?&rsquo;
&ldquo;Willie sighs.
&ldquo;&lsquo;All right, Ben,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Darned if I didn&rsquo;t forget all about that.&rsquo;
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why I say,&rdquo; concluded Ben Granger, &ldquo;that you can&rsquo;t tell where ambition
begins any more than you can where it is going to wind up.&rdquo;
A Municipal Report （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Fancy a novel about Chicago or Buffalo, let us say, or Nashville, Tennessee! There are
just three big cities in the United States that are &ldquo;story cities&rdquo; - New York, of course, New
Orleans, and, best of the lot, San Francisco.
FRANK NORRIS.East is East, and West is San Francisco, according to Californians. Californians are a race
of people; they are not merely inhabitants of a State. They are the Southerners of the West.
Now, Chicagoans are no less loyal to their city; but when you ask them why, they stammer
and speak of lake fish and the new Odd Fellows Building. But Californians go into detail.
Of course they have, in the climate, an argument that is good for half an hour while you
are thinking of your coal bills and heavy underwear. But as soon as they come to mistake
your silence for conviction, madness comes upon them, and they picture the city of the
Golden Gate as the Bagdad of the New World. So far, as a matter of opinion, no refutation is
necessary. But, dear cousins all (from Adam and Eve descended), it is a rash one who will lay
his finger on the map and say: &ldquo;In this town there can be no romance - what could happen
here?&rdquo; Yes, it is a bold and a rash deed to challenge in one sentence history, romance, and
Rand and McNally.
NASHVILLE - A city, port of delivery, and the capital of the State of Tennessee, is on the
Cumberland River and on the N. C. &amp; St. L. and the L. &amp; N. railroads. This city is regarded as
the most important educational centre in the South.
I stepped off the train at 8 P.M. Having searched the thesaurus in vain for adjectives, I
must, as a substitution, hie me to comparison in the form of a recipe.
Take a London fog 30 parts; malaria 10 parts; gas leaks 20 parts; dewdrops gathered in a
brick yard at sunrise, 25 parts; odor of honeysuckle 15 parts. Mix.
The mixture will give you an approximate conception of a Nashville drizzle. It is not so
fragrant as a moth-ball nor as thick as pea-soup; but &lsquo;tis enough - &lsquo;twill serve.
I went to a hotel in a tumbril. It required strong self-suppression for me to keep from
climbing to the top of it and giving an imitation of Sidney Carton. The vehicle was drawn by
beasts of a bygone era and driven by something dark and emancipated.
I was sleepy and tired, so when I got to the hotel I hurriedly paid it the fifty cents it
demanded (with approximate lagniappe, I assure you). I knew its habits; and I did not want
to hear it prate about its old &ldquo;marster&rdquo; or anything that happened &ldquo;befo&rsquo; de wah.&rdquo;
The hotel was one of the kind described as &lsquo;renovated.&rdquo; That means $20,000 worth of
new marble pillars, tiling, electric lights and brass cuspidors in the lobby, and a new L. &amp; N.
time table and a lithograph of Lookout Mountain in each one of the great rooms above. The
management was without reproach, the attention full of exquisite Southern courtesy, the
service as slow as the progress of a snail and as good-humored as Rip Van Winkle. The food
was worth traveling a thousand miles for. There is no other hotel in the world where you can
get such chicken livers en brochette.At dinner I asked a Negro waiter if there was anything doing in town. He pondered
gravely for a minute, and then replied: &ldquo;Well, boss, I don&rsquo;t really reckon there&rsquo;s anything at
all doin&rsquo; after sundown.&rdquo;
Sundown had been accomplished; it had been drowned in the drizzle long before. So
that spectacle was denied me. But I went forth upon the streets in the drizzle to see what
might be there. It is built on undulating grounds; and the streets are lighted by electricity at
a cost of $32,470 per annum. As I left the hotel there was a race riot. Down upon me
charged a company of freedmen, or Arabs, or Zulus, armed with - no, I saw with relief that
they were not rifles, but whips. And I saw dimly a caravan of black, clumsy vehicles; and at
the reassuring shouts, &ldquo;Kyar you anywhere in the town, boss, fuh fifty cents,&rdquo; I reasoned that
I was merely a &ldquo;fare&rdquo; instead of a victim.
I walked through long streets, all leading uphill. I wondered how those streets ever
came down again. Perhaps they didn&rsquo;t until they were &ldquo;graded.&rdquo; On a few of the &ldquo;main
streets&rdquo; I saw lights in stores here and there; saw street cars go by conveying worthy
burghers hither and yon; saw people pass engaged in the art of conversation, and heard a
burst of semi-lively laughter issuing from a soda-water and ice-cream parlor. The streets
other than &ldquo;main&rdquo; seemed to have enticed upon their borders houses consecrated to peace
and domesticity. In many of them lights shone behind discreetly drawn window shades; in a
few pianos tinkled orderly and irreproachable music. There was, indeed, little &ldquo;doing.&rdquo; I
wished I had come before sundown. So I returned to my hotel.
In November, 1864, the Confederate General Hood advanced against Nashville, where
he shut up a National force under General Thomas. The latter then sallied forth and
defeated the Confederates in a terrible conflict.
All my life I have heard of, admired, and witnessed the fine marksmanship of the South
in its peaceful conflicts in the tobacco-chewing regions. But in my hotel a surprise awaited
me. There were twelve bright, new, imposing, capacious brass cuspidors in the great lobby,
tall enough to be called urns and so wide-mouthed that the crack pitcher of a lady baseball
team should have been able to throw a ball into one of them at five paces distant. But,
although a terrible battle had raged and was still raging, the enemy had not suffered. Bright,
new, imposing, capacious, untouched, they stood. But, shades of Jefferson Brick! the tile
floor - the beautiful tile floor! I could not avoid thinking of the battle of Nashville, and trying
to draw, as is my foolish habit, some deductions about hereditary marksmanship.
Here I first saw Major (by misplaced courtesy) Wentworth Caswell. I knew him for a
type the moment my eyes suffered from the sight of him. A rat has no geographical habitat.
My old friend, A. Tennyson, said, as he so well said almost everything:
Prophet, curse me the blabbing lip, And curse me the British vermin, the rat.
Let us regard the word &ldquo;British&rdquo; as interchangeable ad lib. A rat is a rat.This man was hunting about the hotel lobby like a starved dog that had forgotten
where he had buried a bone. He had a face of great acreage, red, pulpy, and with a kind of
sleepy massiveness like that of Buddha. He possessed one single virtue - he was very
smoothly shaven. The mark of the beast is not indelible upon a man until he goes about with
a stubble. I think that if he had not used his razor that day I would have repulsed his
advances, and the criminal calendar of the world would have been spared the addition of
one murder.
I happened to be standing within five feet of a cuspidor when Major Caswell opened
fire upon it. I had been observant enough to percieve that the attacking force was using
Gatlings instead of squirrel rifles; so I side-stepped so promptly that the major seized the
opportunity to apologize to a noncombatant. He had the blabbing lip. In four minutes he had
become my friend and had dragged me to the bar.
I desire to interpolate here that I am a Southerner. But I am not one by profession or
trade. I eschew the string tie, the slouch hat, the Prince Albert, the number of bales of
cotton destroyed by Sherman, and plug chewing. When the orchestra plays Dixie I do not
cheer. I slide a little lower on the leather-cornered seat and, well, order another Wurzburger
and wish that Longstreet had - but what&rsquo;s the use?
Major Caswell banged the bar with his fist, and the first gun at Fort Sumter re-echoed.
When he fired the last one at Appomattox I began to hope. But then he began on family
trees, and demonstrated that Adam was only a third cousin of a collateral branch of the
Caswell family. Genealogy disposed of, he took up, to my distaste, his private family matters.
He spoke of his wife, traced her descent back to Eve, and profanely denied any possible
rumor that she may have had relations in the land of Nod.
By this time I was beginning to suspect that he was trying to obscure by noise the fact
that he had ordered the drinks, on the chance that I would be bewildered into paying for
them. But when they were down he crashed a silver dollar loudly upon the bar. Then, of
course, another serving was obligatory. And when I had paid for that I took leave of him
brusquely; for I wanted no more of him. But before I had obtained my release he had prated
loudly of an income that his wife received, and showed a handful of silver money.
When I got my key at the desk the clerk said to me courteously: &ldquo;If that man Caswell
has annoyed you, and if you would like to make a complaint, we will have him ejected. He is
a nuisance, a loafer, and without any known means of support, although he seems to have
some money most the time. But we don&rsquo;t seem to be able to hit upon any means of
throwing him out legally.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said I, after some reflection; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see my way clear to making a complaint.
But I would like to place myself on record as asserting that I do not care for his company.Your town,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;seems to be a quiet one. What manner of entertainment,
adventure, or excitement have you to offer to the stranger within your gates?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the clerk, &ldquo;there will be a show here next Thursday. It is - I&rsquo;ll look it up
and have the announcement sent up to your room with the ice water. Good night.&rdquo;
After I went up to my room I looked out the window. It was only about ten o&rsquo;clock, but I
looked upon a silent town. The drizzle continued, spangled with dim lights, as far apart as
currants in a cake sold at the Ladies&rsquo; Exchange.
&ldquo;A quiet place,&rdquo; I said to myself, as my first shoe struck the ceiling of the occupant of
the room beneath mine. &ldquo;Nothing of the life here that gives color and variety to the cities in
the East and West. Just a good, ordinary, humdrum, business town.&rdquo;
Nashville occupies a foremost place among the manufacturing centres of the country. It
is the fifth boot and shoe market in the United States, the largest candy and cracker
manufacturing city in the South, and does an enormous wholesale drygoods, grocery, and
drug business.
I must tell you how I came to be in Nashville, and I assure you the digression brings as
much tedium to me as it does to you. I was traveling elsewhere on my own business, but I
had a commission from a Northern literary magazine to stop over there and establish a
personal connection between the publication and one of its contributors, Azalea Adair.
Adair (there was no clue to the personality except the handwriting) had sent in some
essays (lost art!) and poems that had made the editors swear approvingly over their one
o&rsquo;clock luncheon. So they had commissioned me to round up said Adair and corner by
contract his or her output at two cents a word before some other publisher offered her ten
or twenty.
At nine o&rsquo;clock the next morning, after my chicken livers en brochette (try them if you
can find that hotel), I strayed out into the drizzle, which was still on for an unlimited run. At
the first corner, I came upon Uncle Caesar. He was a stalwart Negro, older than the pyramids,
with gray wool and a face that reminded me of Brutus, and a second afterwards of the late
King Cettiwayo. He wore the most remarkable coat that I ever had seen or expect to see. It
reached to his ankles an had once been a Confederate gray in colors. But rain and sun and
age had so variegated it that Joseph&rsquo;s coat, beside it, would have faded to a pale
monochrome. I must linger with that coat, for it has to do with the story - the story that is so
long in coming, because you can hardly expect anything to happen in Nashville.
Once it must have been the military coat of an officer. The cape of it had vanished, but
all adown its front it had been frogged and tasseled magnificently. But now the frogs and
tassles were gone. In their stead had been patiently stitched (I surmised by some surviving
&ldquo;black mammy&rdquo;) new frogs made of cunningly twisted common hempen twine. This twinewas frayed and disheveled. It must have been added to the coat as a substitute for vanished
splendors, with tasteless but painstaking devotion, for it followed faithfully the curves of the
long-missing frogs. And, to complete the comedy and pathos of the garment, all its buttons
were gone save one. The second button from the top alone remained. The coat was
fastened by other twine strings tied through the buttonholes and other holes rudely pierced
in the opposite side. There was never such a weird garment so fantastically bedecked and of
so many mottled hues. The lone button was the size of a half-dollar, made of yellow horn
and sewed on with coarse twine.
This Negro stood by a carriage so old that Ham himself might have started a hack line
with it after he left the ark with the two animals hitched to it. As I approached he threw
open the door, drew out a feather duster, waved it without using it, and said in deep,
rumbling tones:
&ldquo;Step right in, suh; ain&rsquo;t a speck of dust in it - jus&rsquo; got back from a funeral, suh.&rdquo;
I inferred that on such gala occasions carriages were given an extra cleaning. I looked up
and down the street and perceived that there was little choice among the vehicles for hire
that lined the curb. I looked in my memorandum book for the address of Azalea Adair.
&ldquo;I want to go to 861 Jessamine Street,&rdquo; I said, and was about to step into the hack. But
for an instant the thick, long, gorilla-like arm of the old Negro barred me. On his massive and
saturnine face a look of sudden suspicion and enmity flashed for a moment. Then, with
quickly returning conviction, he asked blandishingly: &ldquo;What are you gwine there for, boss?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What is it to you?&rdquo; I asked, a little sharply.
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, suh, jus&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;. Only it&rsquo;s a lonesome kind of part of town and few folks ever
has business out there. Step right in. The seats is clean - jes&rsquo; got back from a funeral, suh.&rdquo;
A mile and a half it must have been to our journey&rsquo;s end. I could hear nothing but the
fearful rattle of the ancient hack over the uneven brick paving; I could smell nothing but the
drizzle, now further flavored with coal smoke and something like a mixture of tar and
oleander blossoms. All I could see through the streaming windows were two rows of dim
houses.
The city has an area of 10 square miles; 181 miles of streets, of which 137 miles are
paved; a system of waterworks that cost $2,000,000, with 77 miles of mains.
Eight-sixty-one Jessamine Street was a decayed mansion. Thirty yards back from the
street it stood, outmerged in a splendid grove of trees and untrimmed shrubbery. A row of
box bushes overflowed and almost hid the paling fence from sight; the gate was kept closed
by a rope noose that encircled the gate post and the first paling of the gate. But when yougot inside you saw that 861 was a shell, a shadow, a ghost of former grandeur and
excellence. But in the story, I have not yet got inside.
When the hack had ceased from rattling and the weary quadrupeds came to a rest I
handed my jehu his fifty cents with an additional quarter, feeling a glow of conscious
generosity, as I did so. He refused it.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s two dollars, suh,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I plainly heard you call out at the hotel: &lsquo;Fifty cents to any part
of the town.&lsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s two dollars, suh,&rdquo; he repeated obstinately. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long ways from the hotel.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is within the city limits and well within them.&rdquo; I argued. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that you have
picked up a greenhorn Yankee. Do you see those hills over there?&rdquo; I went on, pointing
toward the east (I could not see them, myself, for the drizzle); &ldquo;well, I was born and raised
on their other side. You old fool nigger, can&rsquo;t you tell people from other people when you
see &lsquo;em?&rdquo;
The grim face of King Cettiwayo softened. &ldquo;Is you from the South, suh? I reckon it was
them shoes of yourn fooled me. They is somethin&rsquo; sharp in the toes for a Southern gen&rsquo;lman
to wear.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then the charge is fifty cents, I suppose?&rdquo; said I inexorably.
His former expression, a mingling of cupidity and hostility, returned, remained ten
seconds, and vanished.
&ldquo;Boss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;fifty cents is right; but I needs two dollars, suh; I&rsquo;m obleeged to have
two dollars. I ain&rsquo;t demandin&rsquo; it now, suh; after I know whar you&rsquo;s from; I&rsquo;m jus&rsquo; sayin&rsquo; that I
has to have two dollars to-night, and business mighty po&rsquo;.&rdquo;
Peace and confidence settled upon his heavy features. He had been luckier than he had
hoped. Instead of having picked up a greenhorn, ignorant of rates, he had come upon an
inheritance.
&ldquo;You confounded old rascal,&rdquo; I said, reaching down to my pocket, &ldquo;you ought to be
turned over to the police.&rdquo;
For the first time I saw him smile. He knew; he knew. HE KNEW.
I gave him two one-dollar bills. As I handed them over I noticed that one of them had
seen parlous times. Its upper right-hand corner was missing, and it had been torn throughthe middle, but joined again. A strip of blue tissue paper, pasted over the split, preserved its
negotiability.
Enough of the African bandit for the present: I left him happy, lifted the rope and
opened a creaky gate.
The house, as I said, was a shell. A paint brush had not touched it in twenty years. I
could not see why a strong wind should not have bowled it over like a house of cards until I
looked again at the trees that hugged it close - the trees that saw the battle of Nashville and
still drew their protecting branches around it against storm and enemy and cold.
Azalea Adair, fifty years old, white-haired, a descendant of the cavaliers, as thin and frail
as the house she lived in, robed in the cheapest and cleanest dress I ever saw, with an air as
simple as a queen&rsquo;s, received me.
The reception room seemed a mile square, because there was nothing in it except
some rows of books, on unpainted white-pine bookshelves, a cracked marble-top table, a
rag rug, a hairless horsehair sofa and two or three chairs. Yes, there was a picture on the wall,
a colored crayon drawing of a cluster of pansies. I looked around for the portrait of Andrew
Jackson and the pinecone hanging basket but they were not there.
Azalea Adair and I had conversation, a little of which will be repeated to you. She was a
product of the old South, gently nurtured in the sheltered life. Her learning was not broad,
but was deep and of splendid originality in its somewhat narrow scope. She had been
educated at home, and her knowledge of the world was derived from inference and by
inspiration. Of such is the precious, small group of essayists made. Whle she talked to me I
kept brushing my fingers, trying, unconsciously, to rid them guiltily of the absent dust from
the half-calf backs of Lamb, Chaucer, Hazlitt, Marcus Aurelius, Montaigne and Hood. She was
exquisite, she was a valuable discovery. Nearly everybody nowadays knows too much - oh,
so much too much - of real life.
I could perceive clearly that Azalea Adair was very poor. A house and a dress she had,
not much else, I fancied. So, divided between my duty to the magazine and my loyalty to the
poets and essayists who fought Thomas in the valley of the Cumberland, I listened to her
voice, which was like a harpsichord&rsquo;s, and found that I could not speak of contracts. In the
presence of the nine Muses and the three Graces one hesitated to lower the topic to two
cents. There would have to be another colloquy after I had regained my commercialism. But
I spoke of my mission, and three o&rsquo;clock of the next afternoon was set for the discussion of
the business proposition.
&ldquo;Your town,&rdquo; I said, as I began to make ready to depart (which is the time for smooth
generalities), &ldquo;seems to be a quiet, sedate place. A home town, I should say, where few
things out of the ordinary ever happen.&rdquo; It carries on an extensive trade in stoves and hollowware with the West and South, and its flouring mills have a daily capacity of more than 2,000
barrels.
Azalea Adair seemed to reflect.
&ldquo;I have never thought of it that way,&rdquo; she said, with a kind of sincere intensity that
seemed to belong to her. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it in the still, quiet places that things do happen? I fancy that
when God began to create the earth on the first Monday morning one could have leaned out
one&rsquo;s window and heard the drops of mud splashing from His trowel as He built up the
everlasting hills. What did the noisiest project in the world - I mean the building of the
Tower of Bable - result in finally? A page and a half of Esperanto in the North American
Review.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said I platitudinously, &ldquo;human nature is the same everywhere; but there is
more color - er - more drama and movement and - er - romance in some cities than in
others.&rdquo;
&ldquo;On the surface,&rdquo; said Azalea Adair. &ldquo;I have traveled many times around the world in a
golden airship wafted on two wings - print and dreams. I have seen (on one of my imaginary
tours) the Sultan of Turkey bowstring with his own hands one of his wives who had
uncovered her face in public. I have seen a man in Nashville tear up his theatre tickets
because his wife was going out with her face covered - with rice powder. In San Francisco&rsquo;s
Chinatown I saw the slave girl Sing Yee dipped slowly, inch by inch, in boiling almond oil to
make her swear she would never see her American lover again. She gave in when the boiling
oil had reached three inches above her knee. At a euchre party in East Nashville the other
night I saw Kitty Morgan cut dead by seven of her schoolmates and lifelong friends because
she had married a house painter. The boiling oil was sizzling as high as her heart; but I wish
you could have seen the fine little smile that she carried from table to table. Oh, yes, it is a
humdrum town. Just a few miles of red brick houses and mud and lumber yards.&rdquo;
Some one knocked hollowly at the back of the house. Azalea Adair breathed a soft
apology and went to investigate the sound. She came back in three minutes with brightened
eyes, a faint flush on her cheeks, and ten years lifted from her shoulders.
&ldquo;You must have a cup of tea before you go,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and a sugar cake.&rdquo;
She reached and shook a little iron bell. In shuffled a small Negro girl about twelve,
barefoot, not very tidy, glowering at me with thumb in mouth and bulging eyes.
Azlea Adair opened a tiny, worn purse and drew out a dollar bill, a dollar bill with the
upper right-hand corner missing, torn in two pieces, and pasted together again with a strip
of blue tissue paper. It was one of the bills I had given the piratical Negro - there was no
doubt about it.&ldquo;Go up to Mr. Baker&rsquo;s store on the corner, Impy,&rdquo; she said, handing the girl the dollar
bill, &ldquo;and get a quarter of a pound of tea - the kind he always sends me - and ten cents
worth of sugar cakes. Now, hurry. The supply of tea in the house happens to be exhausted,&rdquo;
she explained to me.
Impy left by the back way. Before the scrape of her hard, bare feet had died away on
the back porch, a wild shriek - I was sure it was hers - filled the hollow house. Then the deep,
gruff tones of an angry man&rsquo;s voice mingled with the girl&rsquo;s further squeals and unintelligible
words.
Azalea Adair rose without surprise or emotion and disappeared. For two minutes I
heard the hoarse rumble of the man&rsquo;s voice; then someting like an oath and a slight scuffle,
and she returned calmly to her chair.
&ldquo;This is a roomy house,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I have a tenant for part of it. I am sorry to have
to rescind my invitation to tea. It was impossible to get the kind I always use at the store.
Perhaps tomorrow, Mr. Baker will be able to supply me.&rdquo;
I was sure that Impy had not had time to leave the house. I inquired concerning
street-car lines and took my leave. After I was well on my way I remembered that I had not
learned Azalea Adair&rsquo;s name. But to-morrow would do.
That same day I started in on the course of iniquity that this uneventful city forced upon
me. I was in the town only two days, but in that time I managed to lie shamelessly by
telegraph, and to be an accomplice - after the fact, if that is the correct legal term - to a
murder.
As I rounded the corner nearest my hotel the Afrite coachman of the ploychromatic,
nonpareil coat seized me, swung open the dungeony door of his peripatetic sarcophagus,
flirted his feather duster and began his ritual: &ldquo;Step right in, boss. Carriage is clean - jus&rsquo; got
back from a funeral. Fifty cents to any -&rdquo;
And then he knew me and grinned broadly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Scuse me, boss; you is de gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;man what
rid out with me dis mawnin&rsquo;. Thank you kindly, suh.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am going out to 861 again to-morrow afternoon at three,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and if you will be
here, I&rsquo;ll let you drive me. So you know Miss Adair?&rdquo; I concluded, thinking of my dollar bill.
&ldquo;I belonged to her father, Judge Adair, suh,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;I judge that she is pretty poor,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t much money to speak of, has she?&rdquo;
For an instant I looked again at the fierce countenance of King Cettiwayo, and then he
changed back to an extortionate old Negro hack driver.&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t gwine to starve, suh,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;She has reso&rsquo;ces, suh; she has
reso&rsquo;ces.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I shall pay you fifty cents for the trip,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Dat is puffeckly correct, suh,&rdquo; he answered humbly. &ldquo;I jus&rsquo; had to have dat two dollars
dis mawnin&rsquo;, boss.&rdquo;
I went to the hotel and lied by electricity. I wired the magazine: &ldquo;A. Adair holds out for
eight cents a word.&rdquo;
The answer that came back was: &ldquo;Give it to her quick you duffer.&rdquo;
Just before dinner &ldquo;Major&rdquo; Wentworth Caswell bore down upon me with the greetings
of a long-lost friend. I have seen few men whom I have so instantaneously hated, and of
whom it was so difficult to be rid. I was standing at the bar when he invaded me; therefore I
could not wave the white ribbon in his face. I would have paid gladly for the drinks, hoping,
thereby, to escape another; but he was one of those despicable, roaring, advertising bibbers
who must have brass bands and fireworks attend upon every cent that they waste in their
follies.
With an air of producing millions he drew two one-dollar bills from a pocket and
dashed one of them upon the bar. I looked once more at the dollar bill with the upper
right-hand corner missing, torn through the middle, and patched with a strip of blue tissue
paper. It was my dollar bill again. It could have been no other.
I went up to my room. The drizzle and the monotony of a dreary, eventless Southern
town had made me tired and listless. I remember that just before I went to bed I mentally
disposed of the mysterious dollar bill (which might have formed the clew to a tremendously
fine detective story of San Francisco) by saying to myself sleepily: &ldquo;Seems as if a lot of people
here own stock in the Hack-Driver&rsquo;s Trust. Pays dividends promptly, too. Wonder if -&rdquo; Then I
fell asleep.
King Cettiwayo was at his post the next day, and rattled my bones over the stones out
to 861. He was to wait and rattle me back again when I was ready.
Azalea Adair looked paler and cleaner and frailer than she had looked on the day before.
After she had signed the contract at eight cents per word she grew still paler and began to
slip out of her chair. Whitout much trouble I managed to get her up on the antediluvian
horsehair sofa and then I ran out to the sidewalk and yelled to the coffee-colored Pirate to
bring a doctor. With a wisdom that I had not expected in him, he abandoned his team and
struck off up the street afoot, realizing the value of speed. In ten minutes he returned with a
grave, gray-haired and capable man of medicine. In a few words (worth much less than eightcents each) I explained to him my presence in the hollow house of mystery. He bowed with
stately understanding, and turned to the old Negro.
&ldquo;Uncle Caesar,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;Run up to my house and ask Miss Lucy to give you a
cream pitcher full of fresh milk and half a tumbler of port wine. And hurry back. Don&rsquo;t drive -
run. I want you to get back sometime this week.&rdquo;
It occurred to me that Dr. Merriman also felt a distrust as to the speeding powers of the
land-pirate&rsquo;s steeds. After Uncle Caesar was gone, lumberingly, but swiftly, up the street, the
doctor looked me over with great politeness and as much careful calculation until he had
decided that I might do.
&ldquo;It is only a case of insufficient nutrition,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In other words, the result of poverty,
pride, and starvation. Mrs. Caswell has many devoted friends who would be glad to aid her,
but she will accept nothing except from that old Negro, Uncle Caesar, who was once owned
by her family.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mrs. Caswell!&rdquo; said I, in surprise. And then I looked at the contract and saw that she
had signed it &ldquo;Azalea Adair Caswell.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I thought she was Miss Adair,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Married to a drunken, worthless loafer, sir,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;It is said that he robs her
even of the small sums that her old servant contributes toward her support.&rdquo;
When the milk and wine had been brought the doctor soon revived Azalea Adair. She
sat up and talked of the beauty of the autumn leaves that were then in season, and their
height of color. She referred lightly to her fainting seizure as the outcome of an old
palpitation of the heart. Impy fanned her as she lay on the sofa. The doctor was due
elsewhere, and I followed him to the door. I told him that it was within my power and
intentions to make a reasonable advance of money to Azalea Adair on future contributions
to the magazine, and he seemed pleased.
&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;perhaps you would like to know that you have had royalty for a
coachman. Old Caesar&rsquo;s grandfather was a king in Congo. Caesar himself has royal ways, as
you may have observed.&rdquo;
As the doctor was moving off I heard Uncle Caesar&rsquo;s voice inside: &ldquo;Did he get bofe of
dem two dollars from you, Mis&rsquo; Zalea?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, Caesar,&rdquo; I heard Azalea Adair answer weakly. And then I went in and concluded
business negotiations with our contributor. I assumed the responsibility of advancing fifty
dollars, putting it as a necessary formality in binding our bargain. And then Uncle Caesar
drove me back to the hotel.Here ends all of the story as far as I can testify as a witness. The rest must be only bare
statements of facts.
At about six o&rsquo;clock I went out for a stroll. Uncle Caesar was at his corner. He threw
open the door of his carriage, flourished his duster and began his depressing formula: &ldquo;Step
right in, suh. Fifty cents to anywhere in the city - hack&rsquo;s puffickly clean, suh - - jus&rsquo; got back
from a funeral -&rdquo;
And then he recognized me. I think his eyesight was getting bad. His coat had taken on
a few more faded shades of color, the twine strings were more frayed and ragged, the last
remaining button - the button of yellow horn - was gone. A motley descendant of kings was
Uncle Caesar!
About two hours later I saw an excited crowd besieging the front of a drug store. In a
desert where nothing happens this was manna; so I edged my way inside. On an
extemporized couch of empty boxes and chairs was stretched the mortal corporeality of
Major Wentworth Caswell. A doctor was testing him for the immortal ingredient. His
decision was that it was conspicuous by its absence.
The erstwhile Major had been found dead on a dark street and brought by curious and
ennuied citizens to the drug store. The late human being had been engaged in terrific battle
- the details showed that. Loafer and reprobate though he had been, he had been also a
warrior. But he had lost. His hands were yet clinched so tightly that his fingers would not be
opened. The gentle citizens who had know him stood about and searched their vocabularies
to find some good words, if it were possible, to speak of him. One kind-looking man said,
after much thought: &ldquo;When &lsquo;Cas&rsquo; was about fo&rsquo;teen he was one of the best spellers in
school.&rdquo;
While I stood there the fingers of the right hand of &ldquo;the man that was&rdquo; which hung
down the side of a white pine box, relaxed, and dropped something at my feet. I covered it
with one foot quietly, and a little later on I picked it up and pocketed it. I reasoned that in his
last struggle his hand must have seized that object unwittingly and held it in a death grip.
At the hotel that night the main topic of conversation, with the possible exceptions of
politics and prohibition, was the demise of Major Caswell. I heard one man say to a group of
listeners:
&ldquo;In my opinion, gentlemen, Caswell was murdered by somme of these no-account
niggers for his money. He had fifty dollars this afternoon which he showed to several
gentlemen in the hotel. When he was found the money was not on his person.&rdquo;
I left the city the next morning at nine, and as the train was crossing the bridge over the
Cumberland River I took out of my pocket a yellow horn overcoat button the size of afifty-cent piece, with frayed ends of coarse twine hanging from it, and cast it out of the
window into the slow, muddy waters below.
I wonder what&rsquo;s doing in Buffalo!
A Newspaper Story （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>AT 8 A. M. it lay on Giuseppi&rsquo;s news-stand, still damp from the presses. Giuseppi, with
the cunning of his ilk, philandered on the opposite comer, leaving his patrons to help
themselves, no doubt on a theory related to the hypothesis of the watched pot.
This particular newspaper was, according to its custom and design, an educator, a guide,
a monitor, a champion and a household counsellor and vade mecum.
From its many excellencies might be selected three editorials. One was in simple and
chaste but illuminat- ing language directed to parents and teachers, depreca- ting corporal
punishment for children.
Another was an accusive and significant warning addressed to a notorious labour leader
who was on the point of instigating his clients to a troublesome strike.
The third was an eloquent demand that the police force be sustained and aided in
everything that tended to increase its efficiency as public guardians and servants.
Besides these more important chidings and requisitions upon the store of good
citizenship was a wise prescription or form of procedure laid out by the editor of the heartto-heart column in the specific case of a young man who had complained of the obduracy of
his lady love, teaching him how he might win her.
Again, there was, on the beauty page, a complete answer to a young lady inquirer who
desired admonition toward the securing of bright eyes, rosy cheeks and a beautiful
countenance.
One other item requiring special cognizance was a brief &ldquo;personal,&rdquo; running thus:
DEAR JACK: &ndash; Forgive me. You were right. Meet me comer Madison and -th at 8.30 this
morning. We leave at noon.
PENITENT.At 8 o&rsquo;clock a young man with a haggard look and the feverish gleam of unrest in his
eye dropped a penny and picked up the top paper as he passed Giuseppi&rsquo;s stand. A sleepless
night had left him a late riser. There was an office to be reached by nine, and a shave and a
hasty cup of coffee to be crowded into the interval.
He visited his barber shop and then hurried on his way. He pocketed his paper,
meditating a belated perusal of it at the luncheon hour. At the next corner it fell from his
pocket, carrying with it his pair of new gloves. Three blocks he walked, missed the gloves and
turned back fuming.
Just on the half-hour he reached the corner where lay the gloves and the paper. But he
strangely ignored that which he had come to seek. He was holding two little hands as tightly
as ever he could and looking into two penitent brown eyes, while joy rioted in his heart.
&ldquo;Dear Jack,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I knew you would be here on time.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I wonder what she means by that,&rdquo; he was saying to himself; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s all right, it&rsquo;s all
right.&rdquo;
A big wind puffed out of the west, picked up the paper from the sidewalk, opened it out
and sent it flying and whirling down a side street. Up that street was driving a skittish bay to
a spider-wheel buggy, the young man who had written to the heart-to-heart editor for a
recipe that he might win her for whom he sighed.
The wind, with a prankish flurry, flapped the flying newspaper against the face of the
skittish bay. There was a lengthened streak of bay mingled with the red of running gear that
stretched itself out for four blocks. Then a water-hydrant played its part in the cosmogony,
the buggy became matchwood as foreordained, and the driver rested very quietly where he
had been flung on the asphalt in front of a certain brownstone mansion.
They came out and had him inside very promptly. And there was one who made herself
a pillow for his head, and cared for no curious eyes, bending over and saying, &ldquo;Oh, it was you;
it was you all the time, Bobby! Couldn&rsquo;t you see it? And if you die, why, so must I, and &ndash; &ldquo;
But in all this wind we must hurry to keep in touch with our paper.
Policeman O&rsquo;Brine arrested it as a character dangerous to traffic. Straightening its
dishevelled leaves with his big, slow fingers, he stood a few feet from the family entrance of
the Shandon Bells Café. One headline he spelled out ponderously: &ldquo;The Papers to the Front
in a Move to Help the Police.&rdquo;
But, whisht! The voice of Danny, the head bartender, through the crack of the door:
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a nip for ye, Mike, ould man.&ldquo;Behind the widespread, amicable columns of the press Policeman O&rsquo;Brine receives
swiftly his nip of the real stuff. He moves away, stalwart, refreshed, fortified, to his duties.
Might not the editor man view with pride the early, the spiritual, the literal fruit that had
blessed his labours.
Policeman O&rsquo;Brine folded the paper and poked it playfully under the arm of a small boy
that was passing. That boy was named Johnny, and he took the paper home with him. His
sister was named Gladys, and she had written to the beauty editor of the paper asking for
the practicable touchstone of beauty. That was weeks ago, and she had ceased to look for an
answer. Gladys was a pale girl, with dull eyes and a discontented expression. She was
dressing to go up to the avenue to get some braid. Beneath her skirt she pinned two leaves
of the paper Johnny had brought. When she walked the rustling sound was an exact
imitation of the real thing.
On the street she met the Brown girl from the flat below and stopped to talk. The
Brown girl turned green. Only silk at $5 a yard could make the sound that she heard when
Gladys moved. The Brown girl, consumed by jealousy, said something spiteful and went her
way, with pinched lips.
Gladys proceeded toward the avenue. Her eyes now sparkled like jagerfonteins. A rosy
bloom visited her cheeks; a triumphant, subtle, vivifying, smile transfigured her face. She
was beautiful. Could the beauty editor have seen her then! There was something in her
answer in the paper, I believe, about cultivating kind feelings toward others in order to make
plain features attractive.
The labour leader against whom the paper&rsquo;s solemn and weighty editorial injunction
was laid was the father of Gladys and Johnny. He picked up the remains of the journal from
which Gladys had ravished a cosmetic of silken sounds. The editorial did not come under his
eye, but instead it was greeted by one of those ingenious and specious puzzle problems that
enthrall alike the simpleton and the sage.
The labour leader tore off half of the page, provided himself with table, pencil and
paper and glued himself to his puzzle.
Three hours later, after waiting vainly for him at the appointed place, other more
conservative leaders declared and ruled in favour of arbitration, and the strike with its
attendant dangers was averted. Subsequent editions of the paper referred, in coloured inks,
to the clarion tone of its successful denunciation of the labour leader&rsquo;s intended designs.
The remaining leaves of the active journal also went loyally to the proving of its
potency.When Johnny returned from school he sought a secluded spot and removed the
missing columns from the inside of his clothing, where they had been artfully distributed so
as to successfully defend such areas as are generally attacked during scholastic castigations.
Johnny attended a private school and had had trouble with his teacher. As has been said,
there was an excellent editorial against corporal punishment in that morning&rsquo;s issue, and no
doubt it had its effect.
After this can any one doubt the power of the press?
A Night In New Arabia （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The great city of Bagdad-on-the-Subway is caliph-ridden. Its palaces, bazaars, khans,
and byways are thronged with Al Rashids in divers disguises, seeking diversion and victims
for their unbridled generosity. You can scarcely find a poor beggar whom they are willing to
let enjoy his spoils unsuccored, nor a wrecked unfortunate upon whom they will not
reshower the means of fresh misfortune. You will hardly find anywhere a hungry one who
has not had the opportunity to tighten his belt in gift libraries, nor a poor pundit who has
not blushed at the holiday basket of celery-crowned turkey forced resoundingly through his
door by the eleemosynary press.
So then, fearfully through the Harun-haunted streets creep the one-eyed calenders, the
Little Hunchback and the Barber&rsquo;s Sixth Brother, hoping to escape the ministrations of the
roving horde of caliphoid sultans.
Entertainment for many Arabian nights might be had from the histories of those who
have escaped the largesse of the army of Commanders of the Faithful. Until dawn you might
sit on the enchanted rug and listen to such stories as are told of the powerful genie
Roc-Ef-El-Er who sent the Forty Thieves to soak up the oil plant of Ali Baba; of the good
Caliph Kar-Neg-Ghe, who gave away palaces; of the Seven Voyages of Sailbad, the Sinner,
who frequented wooden excursion steamers among the islands; of the Fisherman and the
Bottle; of the Barmecides&rsquo; Boarding house; of Aladdin&rsquo;s rise to wealth by means of his
Wonderful Gasmeter.
But now, there being ten sultans to one Sheherazade, she is held too valuable to be in
fear of the bowstring. In consequence the art of narrative languishes. And, as the lesser
caliphs are hunting the happy poor and the resigned unfortunate from cover to cover in
order to heap upon them strange mercies and mysterious benefits, too often comes the
report from Arabian headquarters that the captive refused &ldquo;to talk.&ldquo;This reticence, then, in the actors who perform the sad comedies of their
philanthropy-scourged world, must, in a degree, account for the shortcomings of this
painfully gleaned tale, which shall be called: THE STORY OF THE CALIPH WHO ALLEVIATED
HIS CONSCIENCE
Old Jacob Spraggins mixed for himself some Scotch and lithia water at his $1,200 oak
sideboard. Inspiration must have resulted from its imbibition, for immediately afterward he
struck the quartered oak soundly with his fist and shouted to the empty dining room:
&ldquo;By the coke ovens of hell, it must be that ten thousand dollars! If I can get that
squared, it&rsquo;ll do the trick.&rdquo;
Thus, by the commonest artifice of the trade, having gained your interest, the action of
the story will now be suspended, leaving you grumpily to consider a sort of dull biography
beginning fifteen years before.
When old Jacob was young Jacob he was a breaker boy in a Pennsylvania coal mine. I
don&rsquo;t know what a breaker boy is; but his occupation seems to be standing by a coal dump
with a wan look and a dinner-pail to have his picture taken for magazine articles. Anyhow,
Jacob was one. But, instead of dying of overwork at nine, and leaving his helpless parents
and brothers at the mercy of the union strikers&rsquo; reserve fund, he hitched up his galluses, put
a dollar or two in a side proposition now and then, and at forty-five was worth $20,000,000.
There now! it&rsquo;s over. Hardly had time to yawn, did you? I&rsquo;ve seen biographies that - but
let us dissemble.
I want you to consider Jacob Spraggins, Esq., after he had arrived at the seventh stage
of his career. The stages meant are, first, humble origin; second, deserved promotion; third,
stockholder; fourth, capitalist; fifth, trust magnate; sixth, rich malefactor; seventh, caliph;
eighth, x. The eighth stage shall be left to the higher mathematics.
At fifty-five Jacob retired from active business. The income of a czar was still rolling in
on him from coal, iron, real estate, oil, railroads, manufactories, and corporations, but none
of it touched Jacob&rsquo;s hands in a raw state. It was a sterilized increment, carefully cleaned and
dusted and fumigated until it arrived at its ultimate stage of untainted, spotless checks in the
white fingers of his private secretary. Jacob built a three-million-dollar palace on a corner lot
fronting on Nabob Avenue, city of New Bagdad, and began to feel the mantle of the late H. A.
Rashid descending upon him. Eventually Jacob slipped the mantle under his collar, tied it in a
neat four-in-hand, and became a licensed harrier of our Mesopotamian proletariat.
When a man&rsquo;s income becomes so large that the butcher actually sends him the kind of
steak he orders, he begins to think about his soul&rsquo;s salvation. Now, the various stages or
classes of rich men must not be forgotten. The capitalist can tell you to a dollar the amountof his wealth. The trust magnate &ldquo;estimates&rdquo; it. The rich malefactor hands you a cigar and
denies that he has bought the P. D. &amp; Q. The caliph merely smiles and talks about
Hammerstein and the musical lasses. There is a record of tremendous altercation at
breakfast in a &ldquo;Where-to-Dine-Well&rdquo; tavern between a magnate and his wife, the rift within
the loot being that the wife calculated their fortune at a figure $3,000,000 higher than did
her future divorce. Oh, well, I, myself, heard a similar quarrel between a man and his wife
because he found fifty cents less in his pockets than he thought he had. After all, we are all
human - Count Tolstoi, R. Fitzsimmons, Peter Pan, and the rest of us.
Don&rsquo;t lose heart because the story seems to be degenerating into a sort of moral essay
for intellectual readers.
There will be dialogue and stage business pretty soon.
When Jacob first began to compare the eyes of needles with the camels in the Zoo he
decided upon organized charity. He had his secretary send a check for one million to the
Universal Benevolent Association of the Globe. You may have looked down through a grating
in front of a decayed warehouse for a nickel that you had dropped through. But that is
neither here nor there. The Association acknowledged receipt of his favor of the 24th ult.
with enclosure as stated. Separated by a double line, but still mighty close to the matter
under the caption of &ldquo;Oddities of the Day&rsquo;s News&rdquo; in an evening paper, Jacob Spraggins read
that one &ldquo;Jasper Spargyous&rdquo; had &ldquo;donated $100,000 to the U. B. A. of G.&rdquo; A camel may have
a stomach for each day in the week; but I dare not venture to accord him whiskers, for fear
of the Great Displeasure at Washington; but if he have whiskers, surely not one of them will
seem to have been inserted in the eye of a needle by that effort of that rich man to enter
the K. of H. The right is reserved to reject any and all bids; signed, S. Peter, secretary and
gatekeeper.
Next, Jacob selected the best endowed college he could scare up and presented it with
a $200,000 laboratory. The college did not maintain a scientific course, but it accepted the
money and built an elaborate lavatory instead, which was no diversion of funds so far as
Jacob ever discovered.
The faculty met and invited Jacob to come over and take his A B C degree. Before
sending the invitation they smiled, cut out the C, added the proper punctuation marks, and
all was well.
While walking on the campus before being capped and gowned, Jacob saw two
professors strolling nearby. Their voices, long adapted to indoor acoustics, undesignedly
reached his ear.
&ldquo;There goes the latest chevalier d&rsquo;industrie,&rdquo; said one of them, &ldquo;to buy a sleeping
powder from us. He gets his degree to-morrow.&ldquo;&ldquo;In foro conscientai,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s &lsquo;eave &lsquo;arf a brick at &lsquo;im.&rdquo;
Jacob ignored the Latin, but the brick pleasantry was not too hard for him. There was
no mandragora in the honorary draught of learning that he had bought. That was before the
passage of the Pure Food and Drugs Act.
Jacob wearied of philanthropy on a large scale.
&ldquo;If I could see folks made happier,&rdquo; he said to himself - &ldquo;If I could see &lsquo;em myself and
hear &lsquo;em express their gratitude for what I done for &lsquo;em it would make me feel better. This
donatin&rsquo; funds to institutions and societies is about as satisfactory as dropping money into a
broken slot machine.&rdquo;
So Jacob followed his nose, which led him through unswept streets to the homes of the
poorest.
&ldquo;The very thing!&rdquo; said Jacob. &ldquo;I will charter two river steamboats, pack them full of
these unfortunate children and - say ten thousand dolls and drums and a thousand freezers
of ice cream, and give them a delightful outing up the Sound. The sea breezes on that trip
ought to blow the taint off some of this money that keeps coming in faster than I can work it
off my mind.&rdquo;
Jacob must have leaked some of his benevolent intentions, for an immense person with
a bald face and a mouth that looked as if it ought to have a &ldquo;Drop Letters Here&rdquo; sign over it
hooked a finger around him and set him in a space between a barber&rsquo;s pole and a stack of
ash cans. Words came out of the post-office slit - smooth, husky words with gloves on &lsquo;em,
but sounding as if they might turn to bare knuckles any moment.
&ldquo;Say, Sport, do you know where you are at? Well, dis is Mike O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s district you&rsquo;re
buttin&rsquo; into - see? Mike&rsquo;s got de stomach-ache privilege for every kid in dis neighborhood -
see? And if dere&rsquo;s any picnics or red balloons to be dealt out here, Mike&rsquo;s money pays for
&lsquo;em - see? Don&rsquo;t you butt in, or something&rsquo;ll be handed to you. Youse d - - settlers and
reformers with your social ologies and your millionaire detectives have got dis district in a
hell of a fix, anyhow. With your college students and professors rough-housing de
soda-water stands and dem rubber-neck coaches fillin&rsquo; de streets, de folks down here are
&lsquo;fraid to go out of de houses. Now, you leave &lsquo;em to Mike. Dey belongs to him, and he knows
how to handle &lsquo;em. Keep on your own side of de town. Are you some wiser now, uncle, or
do you want to scrap wit&rsquo; Mike O&rsquo;Grady for de Santa Claus belt in dis district?&rdquo;
Clearly, that spot in the moral vineyard was preempted. So Caliph Spraggins menaced
no more the people in the bazaars of the East Side. To keep down his growing surplus he
doubled his donations to organized charity, presented the Y. M. C. A. of his native town with
a $10,000 collection of butterflies, and sent a check to the famine sufferers in China big
enough to buy new emerald eyes and diamond-filled teeth for all their gods. But none ofthese charitable acts seemed to bring peace to the caliph&rsquo;s heart. He tried to get a personal
note into his benefactions by tipping bellboys and waiters $10 and $20 bills. He got well
snickered at and derided for that by the minions who accept with respect gratuities
commensurate to the service performed. He sought out an ambitious and talented but poor
young woman, and bought for her the star part in a new comedy. He might have gotten rid
of $50,000 more of his cumbersome money in this philanthropy if he had not neglected to
write letters to her. But she lost the suit for lack of evidence, while his capital still kept piling
up, and his optikos needleorum camelibus - or rich man&rsquo;s disease - was unrelieved.
In Caliph Spraggins&rsquo;s $3,000,000 home lived his sister Henrietta, who used to cook for
the coal miners in a twenty-five-cent eating house in Coketown, Pa., and who now would
have offered John Mitchell only two fingers of her hand to shake. And his daughter Celia,
nineteen, back from boarding-school and from being polished off by private instructors in
the restaurant languages and those &lsquo;etudes and things.
Celia is the heroine. Lest the artist&rsquo;s delineation of her charms on this very page
humbug your fancy, take from me her authorized description. She was a nice-looking,
awkward, loud, rather bashful, brown-haired girl, with a sallow complexion, bright eyes, and
a perpetual smile. She had a wholesome, Spraggins-inherited love for plain food, loose
clothing, and the society of the lower classes. She had too much health and youth to feel the
burden of wealth. She had a wide mouth that kept the peppermint-pepsin tablets rattling
like hail from the slot-machine wherever she went, and she could whistle hornpipes. Keep
this picture in mind; and let the artist do his worst.
Celia looked out of her window one day and gave her heart to the grocer&rsquo;s young man.
The receiver thereof was at that moment engaged in conceding immortality to his horse and
calling down upon him the ultimate fate of the wicked; so he did not notice the transfer. A
horse should stand still when you are lifting a crate of strictly new-laid eggs out of the
wagon.
Young lady reader, you would have liked that grocer&rsquo;s young man yourself. But you
wouldn&rsquo;t have given him your heart, because you are saving it for a riding-master, or a
shoe-manufacturer with a torpid liver, or something quiet but rich in gray tweeds at Palm
Beach. Oh, I know about it. So I am glad the grocer&rsquo;s young man was for Celia, and not for
you.
The grocer&rsquo;s young man was slim and straight and as confident and easy in his
movements as the man in the back of the magazines who wears the new frictionless roller
suspenders. He wore a gray bicycle cap on the back of his head, and his hair was
straw-colored and curly, and his sunburned face looked like one that smiled a good deal
when he was not preaching the doctrine of everlasting punishment to delivery-wagon horses.
He slung imported A1 fancy groceries about as though they were only the stuff he delivered
at boarding-houses; and when he picked up his whip, your mind instantly recalled Mr. Tacktt
and his air with the buttonless foils.Tradesmen delivered their goods at a side gate at the rear of the house. The grocer&rsquo;s
wagon came about ten in the morning. For three days Celia watched the driver when he
came, finding something new each time to admire in the lofty and almost contemptuous
way he had of tossing around the choicest gifts of Pomona, Ceres, and the canning factories.
Then she consulted Annette.
To be explicit, Annette McCorkle, the second housemaid who deserves a paragraph
herself. Annette Fletcherized large numbers of romantic novels which she obtained at a free
public library branch (donated by one of the biggest caliphs in the business). She was Celia&rsquo;s
sidekicker and chum, though Aunt Henrietta didn&rsquo;t know it, you may hazard a bean or two.
&ldquo;Oh, canary-bird seed!&rdquo; exclaimed Annette. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it a corkin&rsquo; situation? You a heiress,
and fallin&rsquo; in love with him on sight! He&rsquo;s a sweet boy, too, and above his business. But he
ain&rsquo;t susceptible like the common run of grocer&rsquo;s assistants. He never pays no attention to
me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He will to me,&rdquo; said Celia.
&ldquo;Riches -&rdquo; began Annette, unsheathing the not unjustifiable feminine sting.
&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not so beautiful,&rdquo; said Celia, with her wide, disarming smile. &ldquo;Neither am I;
but he sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s any money mixed up with my looks, such as they are. That&rsquo;s
fair. Now, I want you to lend me one of your caps and an apron, Annette.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, marshmallows!&rdquo; cried Annette. &ldquo;I see. Ain&rsquo;t it lovely? It&rsquo;s just like &lsquo;Lurline, the
Left-Handed; or, A Buttonhole Maker&rsquo;s Wrongs.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;ll turn out to be a count.&rdquo;
There was a long hallway (or &ldquo;passageway,&rdquo; as they call it in the land of the Colonels)
with one side latticed, running along the rear of the house. The grocer&rsquo;s young man went
through this to deliver his goods. One morning he passed a girl in there with shining eyes,
sallow complexion, and wide, smiling mouth, wearing a maid&rsquo;s cap and apron. But as he was
cumbered with a basket of Early Drumhead lettuce and Trophy tomatoes and three bunches
of asparagus and six bottles of the most expensive Queen olives, he saw no more than that
she was one of the maids.
But on his way out he came up behind her, and she was whistling &ldquo;Fisher&rsquo;s Hornpipe&rdquo;
so loudly and clearly that all the piccolos in the world should have disjointed themselves and
crept into their cases for shame.
The grocer&rsquo;s young man stopped and pushed back his cap until it hung on his collar
button behind.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s out o&rsquo; sight, Kid,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;My name is Celia, if you please,&rdquo; said the whistler, dazzling him with a three-inch
smile.
That&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;m Thomas McLeod. What part of the house do you work in?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the - the second parlor maid.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do you know the &lsquo;Falling Waters&rsquo;?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Celia, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know anybody. We got rich too quick - that is, Mr. Spraggins
did.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you acquainted,&rdquo; said Thomas McLeod. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strathspey - the first cousin to a
hornpipe.&rdquo;
If Celia&rsquo;s whistling put the piccolos out of commission, Thomas McLeod&rsquo;s surely made
the biggest flutes hunt their holes. He could actually whistle bass.
When he stopped Celia was ready to jump into his delivery wagon and ride with him
clear to the end of the pier and on to the ferry-boat of the Charon line.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be around to-morrow at 10:15,&rdquo; said Thomas, &ldquo;with some spinach and a case of
carbonic.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll practice that what-you-may-call-it,&rdquo; said Celia. &ldquo;I can whistle a fine second.&rdquo;
The processes of courtship are personal, and do not belong to general literature. They
should be chronicled in detail only in advertisements of iron tonics and in the secret by-laws
of the Woman&rsquo;s Auxiliary of the Ancient Order of the Rat Trap. But genteel writing may
contain a description of certain stages of its progress without intruding upon the province of
the X-ray or of park policemen.
A day came when Thomas McLeod and Celia lingered at the end of the latticed
&ldquo;passage.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sixteen a week isn&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; said Thomas, letting his cap rest on his shoulder blades.
Celia looked through the lattice-work and whistled a dead march. Shopping with Aunt
Henrietta the day before, she had paid that much for a dozen handkerchiefs.
&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll get a raise next month,&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be around to-morrow at the same
time with a bag of flour and the laundry soap.&ldquo;&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Celia. &ldquo;Annette&rsquo;s married cousin pays only $20 a month for a flat in the
Bronx.&rdquo;
Never for a moment did she count on the Spraggins money. She knew Aunt Henrietta&rsquo;s
invincible pride of caste and pa&rsquo;s mightiness as a Colossus of cash, and she understood that
if she chose Thomas she and her grocer&rsquo;s young man might go whistle for a living.
Another day came, Thomas violating the dignity of Nabob Avenue with &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s
Dream,&rdquo; whistled keenly between his teeth.
&ldquo;Raised to eighteen a week yesterday,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Been pricing flats around Morningside.
You want to start untying those apron strings and unpinning that cap, old girl.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, Tommy!&rdquo; said Celia, with her broadest smile. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that be enough? I got Betty
to show me how to make a cottage pudding. I guess we could call it a flat pudding if we
wanted to.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And tell no lie,&rdquo; said Thomas.
&ldquo;And I can sweep and polish and dust - of course, a parlor maid learns that. And we
cold whistle duets of evenings.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The old man said he&rsquo;d raise me to twenty at Christmas if Bryan couldn&rsquo;t think of any
harder name to call a Republican than a &lsquo;postponer,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the grocer&rsquo;s young man.
&ldquo;I can sew,&rdquo; said Celia; &ldquo;and I know that you must make the gas company&rsquo;s man show
his badge when he comes to look at the meter; and I know how to put up quince jam and
window curtains.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bully! you&rsquo;re all right, Cele. Yes, I believe we can pull it off on eighteen.&rdquo;
As he was jumping into the wagon the second parlor maid braved discovery by running
swiftly to the gate.
&ldquo;And, oh, Tommy, I forgot,&rdquo; she called, softly. &ldquo;I believe I could make your neckties.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Forget it,&rdquo; said Thomas decisively.
&ldquo;And another thing,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Sliced cucumbers at night will drive away
cockroaches.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And sleep, too, you bet,&rdquo; said Mr. McLeod. &ldquo;Yes, I believe if I have a delivery to make
on the West Side this afternoon I&rsquo;ll look in at a furniture store I know over there.&ldquo;It was just as the wagon dashed away that old Jacob Spraggins struck the sideboard
with his fist and made the mysterious remark about ten thousand dollars that you perhaps
remember. Which justifies the reflection that some stories, as well as life, and puppies
thrown into wells, move around in circles. Painfully but briefly we must shed light on Jacob&rsquo;s
words.
The foundation of his fortune was made when he was twenty. A poor coal-digger (ever
hear of a rich one?) had saved a dollar or two and bought a small tract of land on a hillside
on which he tried to raise corn. Not a nubbin. Jacob, whose nose was a divining-rod, told
him there was a vein of coal beneath. he bought the land from the miner for $125 and sold
it a month afterward for $10,000. Luckily the miner had enough left of his sale money to
drink himself into a black coat opening in the back, as soon as he heard the news.
And so, for forty years afterward, we find Jacob illuminated with the sudden thought
that if he could make restitution of this sum of money to the heirs or assigns of the unlucky
miner, respite and Nepenthe might be his.
And now must come swift action, for we have here some four thousand words and not
a tear shed and never a pistol, joke, safe, nor bottle cracked.
Old Jacob hired a dozen private detectives to find the heirs, if any existed, of the old
miner, Hugh McLeod.
Get the point? Of course I know as well as you do that Thomas is going to be the heir. I
might have concealed the name; but why always hold back you mystery till the end? I say, let
it come near the middle so people can stop reading there if they want to.
After the detectives had trailed false clues about three thousand dollars - I mean miles -
they cornered Thomas at the grocery and got his confession that Hugh McLeod had been his
grandfather, and that there were no other heirs. They arranged a meeting for him and old
Jacob one morning in one of their offices.
Jacob liked the young man very much. He liked the way he looked straight at him when
he talked, and the way he threw his bicycle cap over the top of a rose-colored vase on the
centre-table.
There was a slight flaw in Jacob&rsquo;s system of restitution. He did not consider that the act,
to be perfect, should include confession. So he represented himself to be the agent of the
purchaser of the land who had sent him to refund the sale price for the ease of his
conscience.&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Thomas, &ldquo;this sounds to me like an illustrated post-card from South
Boston with &lsquo;We&rsquo;re having a good time here&rsquo; written on it. I don&rsquo;t know the game. Is this ten
thousand dollars money, or do I have to save so many coupons to get it?&rdquo;
Old Jacob counted out to him twenty five-hundred-dollar bills.
That was better, he thought, than a check. Thomas put them thoughtfully into his
pocket.
&ldquo;Grandfather&rsquo;s best thanks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to the party who sends it.&rdquo;
Jacob talked on, asking him about his work, how he spent his leisure time, and what his
ambitions were. The more he saw and heard of Thomas, the better he liked him. He had not
met many young men in Bagdad so frank and wholesome.
&ldquo;I would like to have you visit my house,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I might help you in investing or
laying out your money. I am a very wealthy man. I have a daughter about grown, and I would
like for you to know her. There are not many young men I would care to have call on her.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m obliged,&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much at making calls. It&rsquo;s generally the side
entrance for mine. And, besides, I&rsquo;m engaged to a girl that has the Delaware peach crop
killed in the blossom. She&rsquo;s a parlor maid in a house where I deliver goods. She won&rsquo;t be
working there much longer, though. Say, don&rsquo;t forget to give your friend my grandfather&rsquo;s
best regards. You&rsquo;ll excuse me now; my wagon&rsquo;s outside with a lot of green stuff that&rsquo;s got to
be delivered. See you again, sir.&rdquo;
At eleven Thomas delivered some bunches of parsley and lettuce at the Spraggins
mansion. Thomas was only twenty-two; so, as he came back, he took out the handful of
five-hundred-dollar bills and waved them carelessly. Annette took a pair of eyes as big as
creamed onion to the cook.
&ldquo;I told you he was a count,&rdquo; she said, after relating. &ldquo;He never would carry on with me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But you say he showed money,&rdquo; said the cook.
&ldquo;Hundreds of thousands,&rdquo; said Annette. &ldquo;Carried around loose in his pockets. And he
never would look at me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It was paid to me to-day,&rdquo; Thomas was explaining to Celia outside. &ldquo;It came from my
grandfather&rsquo;s estate. Say, Cele, what&rsquo;s the use of waiting now? I&rsquo;m going to quit the job
to-night. Why can&rsquo;t we get married next week?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; said Celia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no parlor maid. I&rsquo;ve been fooling you. I&rsquo;m Miss Spraggins -
Celia Spraggins. The newspapers say I&rsquo;ll be worth forty million dollars some day.&ldquo;Thomas pulled his cap down straight on his head for the first time since we have known
him.
&ldquo;I suppose then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I suppose then you&rsquo;ll not be marrying me next week. But
you can whistle.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Celia, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be marrying you next week. My father would never let me
marry a grocer&rsquo;s clerk. But I&rsquo;ll marry you to-night, Tommy, if you say so.&rdquo;
Old Jacob Spraggins came home at 9:30 P. M., in his motor car. The make of it you will
have to surmise sorrowfully; I am giving you unsubsidized fiction; had it been a street car I
could have told you its voltage and the number of wheels it had. Jacob called for his
daughter; he had bought a ruby necklace for her, and wanted to hear her say what a kind,
thoughtful, dear old dad he was.
There was a brief search in the house for her, and then came Annette, glowing with the
pure flame of truth and loyalty well mixed with envy and histrionics.
&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; said she, wondering if she should kneel, &ldquo;Miss Celia&rsquo;s just this minute running
away out of the side gate with a young man to be married. I couldn&rsquo;t stop her, sir. They went
in a cab.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What young man?&rdquo; roared old Jacob.
&ldquo;A millionaire, if you please, sir - a rich nobleman in disguise. He carries his money with
him, and the red peppers and the onions was only to blind us, sir. He never did seem to take
to me.&rdquo;
Jacob rushed out in time to catch his car. The chauffeur had been delayed by trying to
light a cigarette in the wind.
&ldquo;Here, Gaston, or Mike, or whatever you call yourself, scoot around the corner quicker
than blazes and see if you can see a cab. If you do, run it down.&rdquo;
There was a cab in sight a block away. Gaston, or Mike, with his eyes half shut and his
mind on his cigarette, picked up the trail, neatly crowded the cab to the curb and pocketed
it.
&ldquo;What t&rsquo;ell you doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; yelled the cabman.
&ldquo;Pa!&rdquo; shrieked Celia.&ldquo;Grandfather&rsquo;s remorseful friend&rsquo;s agent!&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s on his
conscience now.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A thousand thunders,&rdquo; said Gaston, or Mike. &ldquo;I have no other match.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said old Jacob, severely, &ldquo;how about that parlor maid you were engaged
to?&rdquo;
A couple of years afterward old Jacob went into the office of his private secretary.
&ldquo;The Amalgamated Missionary Society solicits a contribution of $30,000 toward the
conversion of the Koreans,&rdquo; said the secretary.
&ldquo;Pass &lsquo;em up,&rdquo; said Jacob.
&ldquo;The University of Plumville writes that its yearly endowment fund of $50,000 that you
bestowed upon it is past due.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tell &lsquo;em it&rsquo;s been cut out.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Scientific Society of Clam Cove, Long Island, asks for $10,000 to buy alcohol to
preserve specimens.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Waste basket.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Society for Providing Healthful Recreation for Working Girls wants $20,000 from
you to lay out a golf course.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tell &lsquo;em to see an undertaker.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cut &lsquo;em all out,&rdquo; went on Jacob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve quit being a good thing. I need every dollar I can
scrape or save. I want you to write to the directors of every company that I&rsquo;m interested in
and recommend a 10 per cent. cut in salaries. And say - I noticed half a cake of soap lying in
a corner of the hall as I came in. I want you to speak to the scrubwoman about waste. I&rsquo;ve
got no money to throw away. And say - we&rsquo;ve got vinegar pretty well in hand, haven&rsquo;t we?&rsquo;
&ldquo;The Globe Spice &amp; Seasons Company,&rdquo; said secretary, &ldquo;controls the market at present.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Raise vinegar two cents a gallon. Notify all our branches.&rdquo;
Suddenly Jacob Spraggin&rsquo;s plump red face relaxed into a pulpy grin. He walked over to
the secretary&rsquo;s desk and showed a small red mark on his thick forefinger.&ldquo;Bit it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;darned if he didn&rsquo;t, and he ain&rsquo;t had the tooth three weeks - Jaky
McLeod, my Celia&rsquo;s kid. He&rsquo;ll be worth a hundred millions by the time he&rsquo;s twenty-one if I
can pile it up for him.&rdquo;
As he was leaving, old Jacob turned at the door, and said:
&ldquo;Better make that vinegar raise three cents instead of two. I&rsquo;ll be back in an hour and
sign the letters.&rdquo;
The true history of the Caliph Harun Al Rashid relates that toward the end of his reign
he wearied of philanthropy, and caused to be beheaded all his former favorites and
companions of his &ldquo;Arabian Nights&rdquo; rambles. Happy are we in these days of enlightenment,
when the only death warrant the caliphs can serve on us is in the form of a tradesman&rsquo;s bill.
No Story （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>To avoid having this book hurled into corner of the room by the suspicious reader, I will
assert in time that this is not a newspaper story. You will encounter no shirt-sleeved,
omniscient city editor, no prodigy &ldquo;cub&rdquo; reporter just off the farm, no scoop, no story&ndash;no
anything.
But if you will concede me the setting of the first scene in the reporters&rsquo; room of the
Morning Beacon, I will repay the favor by keeping strictly my promises set forth above.
I was doing space-work on the Beacon, hoping to be put on a salary. Some one had
cleared with a rake or a shovel a small space for me at the end of a long table piled high with
exchanges, Congressional Records, and old files. There I did my work. I wrote whatever the
city whispered or roared or chuckled to me on my diligent wanderings about its streets. My
income was not regular.
One day Tripp came in and leaned on my table. Tripp was something in the mechanical
department&ndash;I think he had something to do with the pictures, for he smelled of
photographers&rsquo; supplies, and his hands were always stained and cut up with acids. He was
about twenty-five and looked forty. Half of his face was covered with short, curly red
whiskers that looked like a door-mat with the &ldquo;welcome&rdquo; left off. He was pale and
unhealthy and miserable and fawning, and an assiduous borrower of sums ranging from
twenty-five cents to a dollar. One dollar was his limit. He knew the extent of his credit as well
as the Chemical National Bank knows the amount of H20 that collateral will show on analysis.
When he sat on my table he held one hand with the other to keep both from shaking.Whiskey. He had a spurious air of lightness and bravado about him that deceived no one, but
was useful in his borrowing because it was so pitifully and perceptibly assumed.
This day I had coaxed from the cashier five shining silver dollars as a grumbling advance
on a story that the Sunday editor had reluctantly accepted. So if I was not feeling at peace
with the world, at least an armistice had been declared; and I was beginning with ardor to
write a description of the Brooklyn Bridge by moonlight.
&ldquo;Well, Tripp,&rdquo; said I, looking up at him rather impatiently, &ldquo;how goes it?&rdquo; He was looking
to-day more miserable, more cringing and haggard and downtrodden than I had ever seen
him. He was at that stage of misery where he drew your pity so fully that you longed to kick
him.
&ldquo;Have you got a dollar?&rdquo; asked Tripp, with his most fawning look and his dog-like eyes
that blinked in the narrow space between his high- growing matted beard and his
low-growing matted hair.
&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said I; and again I said, &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; more loudly and inhospitably, &ldquo;and four
besides. And I had hard work corkscrewing them out of old Atkinson, I can tell you. And I
drew them,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;to meet a want&ndash;a hiatus&ndash;a demand&ndash;a need&ndash;an exigency&ndash;a
requirement of exactly five dollars.&rdquo;
I was driven to emphasis by the premonition that I was to lose one of the dollars on the
spot.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to borrow any,&rdquo; said Tripp, and I breathed again. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d like to
get put onto a good story,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a rattling fine one for you. You ought to
make it run a column at least. It&rsquo;ll make a dandy if you work it up right. It&rsquo;ll probably cost you
a dollar or two to get the stuff. I don&rsquo;t want anything out of it myself.&rdquo;
I became placated. The proposition showed that Tripp appreciated past favors, although
he did not return them. If he had been wise enough to strike me for a quarter then he would
have got it.
&ldquo;What is the story ?&rdquo; I asked, poising my pencil with a finely calculated editorial air.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Tripp. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a girl. A beauty. One of the howlingest Amsden&rsquo;s Junes you
ever saw. Rosebuds covered with dew- violets in their mossy bed&ndash;and truck like that. She&rsquo;s
lived on Long Island twenty years and never saw New York City before. I ran against her on
Thirty-fourth Street. She&rsquo;d just got in on the East River ferry. I tell you, she&rsquo;s a beauty that
would take the hydrogen out of all the peroxides in the world. She stopped me on the street
and asked me where she could find George Brown. Asked me where she could find George
Brown in New York City! What do you think of that?&ldquo;I talked to her, and found that she was going to marry a young farmer named
Dodd&ndash;Hiram Dodd&ndash;next week. But it seems that George Brown still holds the championship
in her youthful fancy. George had greased his cowhide boots some years ago, and came to
the city to make his fortune. But he forgot to remember to show up again at Greenburg, and
Hiram got in as second-best choice. But when it comes to the scratch Ada&ndash;her name&rsquo;s Ada
Lowery&ndash;saddles a nag and rides eight miles to the railroad station and catches the 6.45 A.M.
train for the city. Looking for George, you know&ndash;you understand about women&ndash; George
wasn&rsquo;t there, so she wanted him.
&ldquo;Well, you know, I couldn&rsquo;t leave her loose in Wolftown-on-the-Hudson. I suppose she
thought the first person she inquired of would say: &lsquo;George Brown ?&ndash;why, yes&ndash;lemme
see&ndash;he&rsquo;s a short man with light-blue eyes, ain&rsquo;t he? Oh yes&ndash;you&rsquo;ll find George on One
Hundred and Twenty- fifth Street, right next to the grocery. He&rsquo;s bill-clerk in a saddleand-harness store.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s about how innocent and beautiful she is. You know those little
Long Island water-front villages like Greenburg- -a couple of duck-farms for sport, and clams
and about nine summer visitors for industries. That&rsquo;s the kind of a place she comes from.
But, say&ndash;you ought to see her!
&ldquo;What could I do? I don&rsquo;t know what money looks like in the morning. And she&rsquo;d paid
her last cent of pocket-money for her railroad ticket except a quarter, which she had
squandered on gum-drops. She was eating them out of a paper bag. I took her to a
boarding-house on Thirty-second Street where I used to live, and hocked her. She&rsquo;s in soak
for a dollar. That&rsquo;s old Mother McGinnis&rsquo; price per day. I&rsquo;ll show you the house.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What words are these, Tripp?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I thought you said you had a story. Every
ferryboat that crosses the East River brings or takes away girls from Long Island.&rdquo;
The premature lines on Tripp&rsquo;s face grew deeper. He frowned seriously from his tangle
of hair. He separated his hands and emphasized his answer with one shaking forefinger.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what a rattling fine story it would make? You could do it fine.
All about the romance, you know, and describe the girl, and put a lot of stuff in it about true
love, and sling in a few stickfuls of funny business&ndash;joshing the Long Islanders about being
green, and, well&ndash;you know how to do it. You ought to get fifteen dollars out of it, anyhow.
And it&rsquo;ll. cost you only about four dollars. You&rsquo;ll make a clear profit of eleven.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How will it cost me four dollars?&rdquo; I asked, suspiciously.
&ldquo;One dollar to Mrs. McGinnis,&rdquo; Tripp answered, promptly, &ldquo;and two dollars to pay the
girl&rsquo;s fare back home.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And the fourth dimension?&rdquo; I inquired, making a rapid mental calculation.
&ldquo;One dollar to me,&rdquo; said Tripp. &ldquo;For whiskey. Are you on?&ldquo;I smiled enigmatically and spread my elbows as if to begin writing again. But this grim,
abject, specious, subservient, burr-like wreck of a man would not be shaken off. His
forehead suddenly became shiningly moist.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; he said, with a sort of desperate calmness, &ldquo;that this girl has got to be
sent home to-day&ndash;not to-night nor to-morrow, but to-day? I can&rsquo;t do anything for her. You
know, I&rsquo;m the janitor and corresponding secretary of the Down-and-Out Club.. I thought you
could make a newspaper story out of it and win out a piece of money on general results. But,
anyhow, don&rsquo;t you see that she&rsquo;s got to get back home before night?&rdquo;
And then I began to feel that dull, leaden, soul-depressing sensation known as the
sense of duty. Why should that sense fall upon one as a weight and a burden? I knew that I
was doomed that day to give up the bulk of my store of hard-wrung coin to the relief of this
Ada Lowery. But I swore to myself that Tripp&rsquo;s whiskey dollar would not be forthcoming. He
might play knight-errant at my expense, but he would indulge in no wassail afterward,
commemorating my weakness and gullibility. In a kind of chilly anger I put on my coat and
hat.
Tripp, submissive, cringing, vainly endeavoring to please, conducted me via the
street-cars to the human pawn-shop of Mother McGinnis. I paid the fares. It seemed that
the collodion-scented Don Quixote and the smallest minted coin were strangers.
Tripp pulled the bell at the door of the mouldly red-brick boarding- house. At its faint
tinkle he paled, and crouched as a rabbit makes ready to spring away at the sound of a
hunting-dog. I guessed what a life he had led, terror-haunted by the coming footsteps of
landladies.
&ldquo;Give me one of the dollars&ndash;quick!&rdquo; he said.
The door opened six inches. Mother McGinnis stood there with white eyes&ndash;they were
white, I say&ndash;and a yellow face, holding together at her throat with one hand a dingy pink
flannel dressing-sack. Tripp thrust the dollar through the space without a word, and it
bought us entry.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the parlor,&rdquo; said the McGinnis, turning the back of her sack upon us.
In the dim parlor a girl sat at the cracked marble centre-table weeping comfortably and
eating gum-drops. She was a flawless beauty. Crying had only made her brilliant eyes
brighter. When she crunched a gum-drop you thought only of the poetry of motion and
envied the senseless confection. Eve at the age of five minutes must have been a ringer for
Miss Ada Lowery at nineteen or twenty. I was introduced, and a gum-drop suffered neglect
while she conveyed to me a naive interest, such as a puppy dog (a prize winner) might
bestow upon a crawling beetle or a frog.Tripp took his stand by the table, with the fingers of one hand spread upon it, as an
attorney or a master of ceremonies might have stood. But he looked the master of nothing.
His faded coat was buttoned high, as if it sought to be charitable to deficiencies of tie and
linen.
I thought of a Scotch terrier at the sight of his shifty eyes in the glade between his
tangled hair and beard. For one ignoble moment I felt ashamed of having been introduced
as his friend in the presence of so much beauty in distress. But evidently Tripp meant to
conduct the ceremonies, whatever they might be. I thought I detected in his actions and
pose an intention of foisting the situation upon me as material for a newspaper story, in a
lingering hope of extracting from me his whiskey dollar.
&ldquo;My friend&rdquo; (I shuddered), &ldquo;Mr. Chalmers,&rdquo; said Tripp, &ldquo;will tell you, Miss Lowery, the
same that I did. He&rsquo;s a reporter, and he can hand out the talk better than I can. That&rsquo;s why I
brought him with me.&rdquo; (0 Tripp, wasn&rsquo;t it the silver-tongued orator you wanted?) &ldquo;He&rsquo;s wise
to a lot of things, and he&rsquo;ll tell you now what&rsquo;s best to do.&rdquo;
I stood on one foot, as it were, as I sat in my rickety chair.
&ldquo;Why&ndash;er&ndash;Miss Lowery,&rdquo; I began, secretly enraged at Tripp&rsquo;s awkward opening, &ldquo;I am at
your service, of course, but&ndash;er&ndash;as I haven&rsquo;t been apprized of the circumstances of the case,
I&ndash;er&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Miss Lowery, beaming for a moment, &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t as bad as that&ndash;there ain&rsquo;t any
circumstances. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever been in New York except once when I was five
years old, and I had no idea it was such a big town. And I met Mr.&ndash;Mr. Snip on the street and
asked him about a friend of mine, and he brought me here and asked me to wait.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I advise you, Miss Lowery,&rdquo; said Tripp, &ldquo;to tell Mr. Chalmers all. He&rsquo;s a friend of mine&rdquo; (I
was getting used to it by this time), &ldquo;and he&rsquo;ll give you the right tip.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; said Miss Ada, chewing a gum-drop toward me. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t anything
to tell except that&ndash;well, everything&rsquo;s fixed for me to marry Hiram Dodd next Thursday
evening. Hi has got two hundred acres of land with a lot of shore-front, and one of the best
truck-farms on the Island. But this morning I had my horse saddled up&ndash;he&rsquo;s a white horse
named Dancer&ndash;and I rode over to the station. I told &lsquo;em at home I was going to spend the
day with Susie Adams. It was a story, I guess, but I don&rsquo;t care. And I came to New York on the
train, and I met Mr.&ndash;Mr. Flip on the street and asked him if he knew where I could find
G&ndash;G&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Now, Miss Lowery,&rdquo; broke in Tripp, loudly, and with much bad taste, I thought, as she
hesitated with her word, &ldquo;you like this young man, Hiram Dodd, don&rsquo;t you? He&rsquo;s all right, and
good to you, ain&rsquo;t he?&ldquo;&ldquo;Of course I like him,&rdquo; said Miss Lowery emphatically. &ldquo;Hi&rsquo;s all right. And of course he&rsquo;s
good to me. So is everybody.&rdquo;
I could have sworn it myself. Throughout Miss Ada Lowery&rsquo;s life all men would be to
good to her. They would strive, contrive, struggle, and compete to hold umbrellas over her
hat, check her trunk, pick up her handkerchief, buy for her soda at the fountain.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; went on Miss Lowery, &ldquo;last night got to thinking about G&ndash; George, and I&ndash;&rdquo;
Down went the bright gold head upon dimpled, clasped hands on the table. Such a
beautiful April storm! Unrestrainedly sobbed. I wished I could have comforted her. But I was
not George. And I was glad I was not Hiram&ndash;and yet I was sorry, too.
By-and-by the shower passed. She straightened up, brave and half-way smiling. She
would have made a splendid wife, for crying only made her eyes more bright and tender. She
took a gum-drop and began her story.
&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m a terrible hayseed,&rdquo; she said between her little gulps and sighs, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t
help it. G&ndash;George Brown and I were sweet- hearts since he was eight and I was five. When
he was nineteen&ndash;that was four years ago&ndash;he left Greenburg and went to the city. He said he
was going to be a policeman or a railroad president or something. And then he was coming
back for me. But I never heard from him any more. And I&ndash;I&ndash;liked him.&rdquo;
Another flow of tears seemed imminent, but Tripp hurled himself into the crevasse and
dammed it. Confound him, I could see his game. He was trying to make a story of it for his
sordid ends and profit.
&ldquo;Go on, Mr. Chalmers,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and tell the lady what&rsquo;s the proper caper. That&rsquo;s what I
told her&ndash;you&rsquo;d hand it to her straight. Spiel up.&rdquo;
I coughed, and tried to feel less wrathful toward Tripp. I saw my duty. Cunningly I had
been inveigled, but I was securely trapped. Tripp&rsquo;s first dictum to me had been just and
correct. The young lady must be sent back to Greenburg that day. She must be argued with,
convinced, assured, instructed, ticketed, and returned without delay. I hated Hiram and
despised George; but duty must be done.
Noblesse oblige and only five silver dollars are not strictly romantic compatibles, but
sometimes they can be made to jibe. It was mine to be Sir Oracle, and then pay the freight.
So I assumed an air that mingled Solomon&rsquo;s with that of the general passenger agent of the
Long Island Railroad.
&ldquo;Miss Lowery,&rdquo; said I, as impressively as I could, &ldquo;life is rather a queer proposition, after
all.&rdquo; There was a familiar sound to these words after I had spoken them, and I hoped MissLowery had never heard Mr. Cohan&rsquo;s song. &ldquo;Those whom we first love we seldom wed. Our
earlier romances, tinged with the magic radiance of youth, often fail to materialize.&rdquo; The last
three words sounded somewhat trite when they struck the air. &ldquo;But those fondly cherished
dreams,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;may cast a pleasant afterglow on our future lives, however
impracticable and vague they may have been. But life is full of realities as well as visions and
dreams. One cannot live on memories. May I ask, Miss Lowery, if you think you could pass a
happy&ndash;that is, a contented and harmonious life with Mr.-er&ndash;Dodd&ndash;if in other ways than
romantic recollections he seems to&ndash;er&ndash;fill the bill, as I might say?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, Hi&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; answered Miss Lowery. &ldquo;Yes, I could get along with him fine. He&rsquo;s
promised me an automobile and a motor-boat. But somehow, when it got so close to the
time I was to marry him, I couldn&rsquo;t help wishing&ndash;well, just thinking about George.
Something must have happened to him or he&rsquo;d have written. On the day he left, he and me
got a hammer and a chisel and cut a dime into two pieces. I took one piece and he took the
other, and we promised to be true to each other and always keep the pieces till we saw each
other again. I&rsquo;ve got mine at home now in a ring-box in the top drawer of my dresser. I guess
I was silly to come up here looking for him. I never realized what a big place it is.&rdquo;
And then Tripp joined in with a little grating laugh that he had, still trying to drag in a
little story or drama to earn the miserable dollar that he craved.
&ldquo;Oh, the boys from the country forget a lot when they come to the city and learn
something. I guess George, maybe, is on the bum, or got roped in by some other girl, or
maybe gone to the dogs on account of whiskey or the races. You listen to Mr. Chalmers and
go back home, and you&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;
But now the time was come for action, for the hands of the clock were moving close to
noon. Frowning upon Tripp, I argued gently and philosophically with Miss Lowery, delicately
convincing her of the importance of returning home at once. And I impressed upon her the
truth that it would not be absolutely necessary to her future happiness that she mention to
Hi the wonders or the fact of her visit to the city that had swallowed up the unlucky George.
She said she had left her horse (unfortunate Rosinante) tied to a tree near the railroad
station. Tripp and I gave her instructions to mount the patient steed as soon as she arrived
and ride home as fast as possible. There she was to recount the exciting adventure of a day
spent with Susie Adams. She could &ldquo;fix&rdquo; Susie&ndash;I was sure of that&ndash; and all would be well.
And then, being susceptible to the barbed arrows of beauty, I warmed to the adventure.
The three of us hurried to the ferry, and there I found the price of a ticket to Greenburg to
be but a dollar and eighty cents. I bought one, and a red, red rose with the twenty cents for
Miss Lowery. We saw her aboard her ferryboat, and stood watching her wave her
handkerchief at us until it was the tiniest white patch imaginable. And then Tripp and I faced
each other, brought back to earth, left dry and desolate in the shade of the sombre verities
of life.The spell wrought by beauty and romance was dwindling. I looked at Tripp and almost
sneered. He looked more careworn, contemptible, and disreputable than ever. I fingered the
two silver dollars remaining in my pocket and looked at him with the half-closed eyelids of
contempt. He mustered up an imitation of resistance.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get a story out of it?&rdquo; he asked, huskily. &ldquo;Some sort of a story, even if you
have to fake part of it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not a line,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I can fancy the look on Grimes&rsquo; face if I should try to put over any
slush like this. But we&rsquo;ve helped the little lady out, and that&rsquo;ll have to be our only reward.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Tripp, almost inaudibly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re out your money. Now, it
seemed to me like a find of a big story, you know&ndash; that is, a sort of thing that would write up
pretty well.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try to forget it,&rdquo; said I, with a praiseworthy attempt at gayety, &ldquo;and take the next
car &lsquo;cross town.&rdquo;
I steeled myself against his unexpressed but palpable desire. He should not coax, cajole,
or wring from me the dollar he craved. I had had enough of that wild-goose chase.
Tripp feebly unbuttoned his coat of the faded pattern and glossy seams to reach for
something that had once been a handkerchief deep down in some obscure and cavernous
pocket. As he did so I caught the shine of a cheap silver-plated watch-chain across his vest,
and something dangling from it caused me to stretch forth my hand and seize it curiously. It
was the half of a silver dime that had been cut in halves with a chisel.
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; I said, looking at him keenly.
&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he responded, dully. &ldquo;George Brown, alias Tripp. what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;
Barring the W. C. T. U., I&rsquo;d like to know if anybody disapproves of my having produced
promptly from my pocket Tripp&rsquo;s whiskey dollar and unhesitatingly laying it in his hand.
One Dollar&rsquo;s Worth （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The judge of the United States court of the district lying along the Rio Grande border
found the following letter one morning in his mail:JUDGE:
When you sent me up for four years you made a talk. Among other hard things, you
called me a rattlesnake. Maybe I am one &ndash; anyhow, you hear me rattling now. One year after
I got to the pen, my daughter died of &ndash; well, they said it was poverty and the disgrace
together. You&rsquo;ve got a daughter, Judge, and I&rsquo;m going to make you know how it feels to lose
one. And I&rsquo;m going to bite that district attorney that spoke against me. I&rsquo;m free now, and I
guess I&rsquo;ve turned to rattlesnake all right. I feel like one. I don&rsquo;t say much, but this is my rattle.
Look out when I strike.
Yours respectfully,
RATTLESNAKE.
Judge Derwent threw the letter carelessly aside. It was nothing new to receive such
epistles from desperate men whom he had been called upon to judge. He felt no alarm.
Later on he showed the letter to Littlefield, the young district attorney, for Littlefield&rsquo;s name
was included in the threat, and the judge was punctilious in matters between himself and
his fellow men.
Littlefield honoured the rattle of the writer, as far as it concerned himself, with a smile
of contempt; but he frowned a little over the reference to the Judge&rsquo;s daughter, for he and
Nancy Derwent were to be married in the fall.
Littlefield went to the clerk of the court and looked over the records with him. They
decided that the letter might have been sent by Mexico Sam, a half-breed border desperado
who had been imprisoned for manslaughter four years before. Then official duties crowded
the mat- ter from his mind, and the rattle of the revengeful serpent was forgotten.
Court was in session at Brownsville. Most of the cases to be tried were charges of
smuggling, counterfeiting, post-office robberies, and violations of Federal laws along the
border. One case was that of a young Mexican, Rafael Ortiz, who had been rounded up by a
clever deputy marshal in the act of passing a counterfeit silver dollar. He had been suspected
of many such deviations from rectitude, but this was the first time that anything provable
had been fixed upon him. Ortiz languished cozily in jail, smoking brown cigarettes and
waiting for trial. Kilpatrick, the deputy, brought the counterfeit dollar and handed it to the
district attorney in his office in the court-house. The deputy and a reputable druggist were
prepared to swear that Ortiz paid for a bottle of medicine with it. The coin was a poor
counterfeit, soft, dull-looking, and made principally of lead. It was the day before the
morning on which the docket would reach the case of Ortiz, and the district attorney was
preparing himself for trial.
&ldquo;Not much need of having in high-priced experts to prove the coin&rsquo;s queer, is there,
Kil?&rdquo; smiled Littlefield, as he thumped the dollar down upon the table, where it fell with no
more ring than would have come from a lump of putty.&ldquo;I guess the Greaser&rsquo;s as good as behind the bars,&rdquo; said the deputy, easing up his
holsters. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got him dead. If it had been just one time, these Mexicans can&rsquo;t tell good
money from bad; but this little yaller rascal belongs to a gang of counterfeiters, I know. This
is the first time I&rsquo;ve been able to catch him doing the trick. He&rsquo;s got a girl down there in
them Mexican jacals on the river bank. I seen her one day when I was watching him. She&rsquo;s as
pretty as a red heifer in a flower bed.&rdquo;
Littlefield shoved the counterfeit dollar into his pocket, and slipped his memoranda of
the case into an envelope. Just then a bright, winsome face, as frank and jolly as a boy&rsquo;s,
appeared in the doorway, and in walked Nancy Derwent.
&ldquo;Oh, Bob, didn&rsquo;t court adjourn at twelve to-day until to-morrow?&rdquo; she asked of
Littlefield.
&ldquo;It did,&rdquo; said the district attorney, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m very glad of it. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of rulings to look
up, and &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s just like you. I wonder you and father don&rsquo;t turn to law books or rulings or
something! I want you to take me out plover-shooting this afternoon. Long Prairie is just
alive with them. Don&rsquo;t say no, please! I want to try my new twelve-bore hammerless. I&rsquo;ve
sent to the livery stable to engage Fly and Bess for the buckboard; they stand fire so nicely. I
was sure you would go.&rdquo;
They were to be married in the fall. The glamour was at its height. The plovers won the
day &ndash; or, rather, the afternoon &ndash; over the calf-bound authorities. Littlefield began to put his
papers away.
There was a knock at the door. Kilpatrick answered it. A beautiful, dark-eyed girl with a
skin tinged with the faintest lemon colour walked into the room. A black shawl was thrown
over her head and wound once around her neck.
She began to talk in Spanish, a voluble, mournful stream of melancholy music.
Littlefield did not under- stand Spanish. The deputy did, and he translated her talk by
portions, at intervals holding up his hand to check the flow of her words.
&ldquo;She came to see you, Mr. Littlefield. Her name&rsquo;s Joya Trevi?as. She wants to see you
about &ndash; well, she&rsquo;s mixed up with that Rafael Ortiz. She&rsquo;s his &ndash; she&rsquo;s his girl. She says he&rsquo;s
innocent. She says she made the money and got him to pass it. Don&rsquo;t you believe her, Mr.
Little-field. That&rsquo;s the way with these Mexi- can girls; they&rsquo;ll lie, steal, or kill for a fellow
when they get stuck on him. Never trust a woman that&rsquo;s in love!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mr. Kilpatrick!&ldquo;Nancy Derwent&rsquo;s indignant exclamation caused the deputy to flounder for a moment in
attempting to explain that he had misquoted his own sentiments, and then he event on with
the translation:
&ldquo;She says she&rsquo;s willing to take his place in the jail if you&rsquo;ll let him out. She says she was
down sick with the fever, and the doctor said she&rsquo;d die if she didn&rsquo;t have medicine. That&rsquo;s
why he passed the lead dollar on the drug store. She says it saved her life. This Rafal. seems
to be her honey, all right; there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff in her talk about love and such things that you
don&rsquo;t want to hear.&rdquo;
It was an old story to the district attorney.
&ldquo;Tell her,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I can do nothing. The case comes up in the morning, and he
will have to make his fight before the court.&rdquo;
Nancy Derwent was not so hardened. She was look- ing with sympathetic interest at
Joya Trevi?as and at Littlefield alternately. The deputy repeated the dis- trict attorney&rsquo;s
words to the girl. She spoke a sentence or two in a low voice, pulled her shawl closely about
her face, and left the room.
&ldquo;What did she say then?&rdquo; asked the district attorney.
&ldquo;Nothing special,&rdquo; said the deputy. &ldquo;She said: &lsquo;If the life of the one&rsquo; &ndash; let&rsquo;s see how it
went &ndash; &lsquo;Si la vida de ella a quien tu amas &ndash; if the life of the girl you love is ever in danger,
remember Rafael Ortiz.&lsquo;&rdquo;
Kilpatrick strolled out through the corridor in the direction of the marshal&rsquo;s office.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you do anything for them, Bob?&rdquo; asked Nancy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a little thing &ndash; just one
counterfeit dollar &ndash; to ruin the happiness of two lives! She was in danger of death, and he
did it to save her. Doesn&rsquo;t the law know the feeling of pity?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t a place in jurisprudence, Nan,&rdquo; said Little- field, &ldquo;especially in re the district
attorney&rsquo;s duty. I&rsquo;ll promise you that the prosecution will not be vindictive; but the man is as
good as convicted when the case is called. Witnesses will swear to his passing the bad dollar
which I have in my pocket at this moment as &lsquo;Exhibit A.&rsquo; There are no Mexicans on the jury,
and it will vote Mr. Greaser guilty without leaving the box.&rdquo;
The plover-shooting was fine that afternoon, and in the excitement of the sport the
case of Rafael and the grief of Joya Trevi?as was forgotten. The district attor- ney and Nancy
Derwent drove out from the town three miles along a smooth, grassy road, and then struck
across a rolling prairie toward a heavy line of timber on Piedra Creek. Beyond this creek lay
Long Prairie, the favourite haunt of the plover. As they were nearing the creek they heardthe galloping of a horse to their right, and saw a man with black hair and a swarthy face
riding toward the woods at a tangent, as if he had come up behind them.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen that fellow somewhere,&rdquo; said Littlefield, who had a memory for faces, &ldquo;but I
can&rsquo;t exactly place him. Some ranchman, I suppose, taking a short cut home.&rdquo;
They spent an hour on Long Prairie, shooting from the buckboard. Nancy Derwent, an
active, outdoor Western girl, was pleased with her twelve-bore. She had bagged within two
brace of her companion&rsquo;s score.
They started homeward at a gentle trot. When within a hundred yards of Piedra Creek a
man rode out of the timber directly toward them.
&ldquo;It looks like the man we saw coming over,&rdquo; remarked Miss Derwent.
As the distance between them lessened, the district attorney suddenly pulled up his
team sharply, with his eyes fixed upon the advancing horseman. That individ- ual had drawn
a Winchester from its scabbard on his saddle and thrown it over his arm.
&ldquo;Now I know you, Mexico Sam!&rdquo; muttered Littlefield to himself. &ldquo;It was you who shook
your rattles in that gentle epistle.&rdquo;
Mexico Sam did not leave things long in doubt. He had a nice eye in all matters relating
to firearms, so when he was within good rifle range, but outside of danger from No. 8 shot,
he threw up his Winchester and opened fire upon the occupants of the buckboard.
The first shot cracked the back of the seat within the two-inch space between the
shoulders of Littlefield and Miss Derwent. The next went through the dashboard and
Littlefield&rsquo;s trouser leg.
The district attorney hustled Nancy out of the buck- board to the ground. She was a
little pale, but asked no questions. She had the frontier instinct that accepts conditions in an
emergency without superfluous argument. They kept their guns in hand, and Littlefield
hastily gathered some handfuls of cartridges from the pasteboard box on the seat and
crowded them into his pockets
&ldquo;Keep behind the horses, Nan,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;That fellow is a ruffian I sent to prison
once. He&rsquo;s trying to get even. He knows our shot won&rsquo;t hurt him at that distance.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right, Bob,&rdquo; said Nancy steadily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid. But you come close, too. Whoa,
Bess; stand still, now!&rdquo;
She stroked Bess&rsquo;s mane. Littlefield stood with his gun ready, praying that the
desperado would come within range.But Mexico Sam was playing his vendetta along safe lines. He was a bird of different
feather from the plover. His accurate eye drew an imaginary line of circumference around
the area of danger from bird-shot, and upon this line lie rode. His horse wheeled to the right,
and as his victims rounded to the safe side of their equine breast- work he sent a ball
through the district attorney&rsquo;s hat. Once he miscalculated in making a détour, and overstepped Ms margin. Littlefield&rsquo;s gun flashed, and Mexico Sam ducked his head to the
harmless patter of the shot. A few of them stung his horse, which pranced promptly back to
the safety line.
The desperado fired again. A little cry came from Nancy Derwent. Littlefield whirled,
with blazing eyes, and saw the blood trickling down her cheek.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hurt, Bob &ndash; only a splinter struck me. I think he hit one of the wheel-spokes.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; groaned Littlefield. &ldquo;If I only had a charge of buckshot!&rdquo;
The ruffian got his horse still, and took careful aim. Fly gave a snort and fell in the
harness, struck in the neck. Bess, now disabused of the idea that plover were being fired at,
broke her traces and galloped wildly away &ndash; Mexican Sam sent a ball neatly through the
fulness of Nancy Derwent&rsquo;s shooting jacket.
&ldquo;Lie down &ndash; lie down!&rdquo; snapped Littlefield. &ldquo;close to the horse &ndash; flat on the ground &ndash;
so.&rdquo; He almost threw her upon the grass against the back of the recum- bent Fly. Oddly
enough, at that moment the words of the Mexican girl returned to his mind:
&ldquo;If the life of the girl you love is ever in danger, remem- ber Rafael Ortiz.&rdquo;
Littlefield uttered an exclamation.
&ldquo;Open fire on him, Nan, across the horse&rsquo;s back. Fire as fast as you can! You can&rsquo;t hurt
him, but keep him dodging shot for one minute while I try to work a little scheme.&rdquo;
Nancy gave a quick glance at Littlefield, and saw him take out his pocket-knife and open
it. Then she turned her face to obey orders, keeping up a rapid fire at the enemy.
Mexico Sam waited patiently until this innocuous fusillade ceased. He had plenty of
time, and he did not care to risk the chance of a bird-shot in his eye when could be avoided
by a little caution. He pulled his heavy Stetson low down over his face until the shots ceased.
Then he drew a little nearer, and fired with careful aim at what he could see of his
victims above the fallen horse. Neither of them moved. He urged his horse a few steps
nearer. He saw the district attorney rise to one knee and deliberately level his shotgun. He
pulled his hat down and awaited the harmless rattle of the tiny pellets.The shotgun blazed with a heavy report. Mexico Sam sighed, turned limp all over, and
slowly fell from his horse &ndash; a dead rattlesnake.
At ten o&rsquo;clock the next morning court opened, and the case of the United States versus
Rafael Ortiz was called. The district attorney, with his arm in a sling, rose and addressed the
court.
&ldquo;May it please your honour,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I desire to enter a nolle pros. in this case. Even
though the defend- ant should be guilty, there is not sufficient evidence in the hands of the
government to secure a conviction. The piece of counterfeit coin upon the identity of which
the case was built is not now available as evidence. I ask, therefore, that the case be stricken
off.&rdquo;
At the noon recess Kilpatrick strolled into the district attorney&rsquo;s office.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been down to take a squint at old Mexico Sam,&rdquo; said the deputy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got
him laid out. Old Mexico was a tough outfit, I reckon. The boys was wonderin&rsquo; down there
what you shot him with. Some said it must have been nails. I never see a gun carry anything
to make holes like he had.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I shot him,&rdquo; said the district attorney, &ldquo;with Exhibit A of your counterfeiting case. Lucky
thing for me &ndash; and somebody else &ndash; that it was as bad money as it was! It sliced up into
slugs very nicely. Say, Kil, can&rsquo;t you go down to the jacals and find where that Mexican girl
lives? Miss Derwent wants to know.&rdquo;
Out of Nazareth （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Okochee, in Georgia, had a boom, and J. Pinkney Bloom came out of it with a &ldquo;wad.&rdquo;
Okochee came out of it with a half-million-dollar debt, a two and a half per cent. city
property tax, and a city council that showed a propensity for traveling the back streets of the
town. These things came about through a fatal resemblance of the river Cooloosa to the
Hudson, as set forth and expounded by a Northern tourist. Okochee felt that New York
should not be allowed to consider itself the only alligator in the swamp, so to speak. And
then that harmless, but persistent, individual so numerous in the South&ndash;the man who is
always clamoring for more cotton mills, and is ready to take a dollar&rsquo;s worth of stock,
provided he can borrow the dollar&ndash;that man added his deadly work to the tourist&rsquo;s innocent
praise, and Okochee fell.The Cooloosa River winds through a range of small mountains, passes Okochee and
then blends its waters trippingly, as fall the mellifluous Indian syllables, with the
Chattahoochee.
Okochee rose, as it were, from its sunny seat on the post-office stoop, hitched up its
suspender, and threw a granite dam two hundred and forty feet long and sixty feet high
across the Cooloosa one mile above the town. Thereupon, a dimpling, sparkling lake backed
up twenty miles among the little mountains. Thus in the great game of municipal rivalry did
Okochee match that famous drawing card, the Hudson. It was conceded that nowhere could
the Palisades be judged superior in the way of scenery and grandeur. Following the picture
card was played the ace of commercial importance. Fourteen thousand horsepower would
this dam furnish. Cotton mills, factories, and manufacturing plants would rise up as the
green corn after a shower. The spindle and the flywheel and turbine would sing the shrewd
glory of Okochee. Along the picturesque heights above the lake would rise in beauty the
costly villas and the splendid summer residences of capital. The naphtha launch of the
millionaire would spit among the romantic coves; the verdured hills would take formal
shapes of terrace, lawn, and park. Money would be spent like water in Okochee, and water
would be turned into money.
The fate of the good town is quickly told. Capital decided not to invest. Of all the great
things promised, the scenery alone came to fulfilment. The wooded peaks, the impressive
promontories of solemn granite, the beautiful green slants of bank and ravine did all they
could to reconcile Okochee to the delinquency of miserly gold. The sunsets gilded the
dreamy draws and coves with a minting that should charm away heart-burning. Okochee,
true to the instinct of its blood and clime, was lulled by the spell. It climbed out of the arena,
loosed its suspender, sat down again on the post-office stoop, and took a chew. It consoled
itself by drawling sarcasms at the city council which was not to blame, causing the fathers,
as has been said, to seek back streets and figure perspiringly on the sinking fund and the
appropriation for interest due.
The youth of Okochee&ndash;they who were to carry into the rosy future the burden of the
debt&ndash;accepted failure with youth&rsquo;s uncalculating joy. For, here was sport, aquatic and
nautical, added to the meagre round of life&rsquo;s pleasures. In yachting caps and flowing neckties
they pervaded the lake to its limits. Girls wore silk waists embroidered with anchors in blue
and pink. The trousers of the young men widened at the bottom, and their hands were
proudly calloused by the oft- plied oar. Fishermen were under the spell of a deep and
tolerant joy. Sailboats and rowboats furrowed the lenient waves, popcorn and ice- cream
booths sprang up about the little wooden pier. Two small excursion steamboats were built,
and plied the delectable waters. Okochee philosophically gave up the hope of eating turtle
soup with a gold spoon, and settled back, not ill content, to its regular diet of lotus and fried
hominy. And out of this slow wreck of great expectations rose up J. Pinkney Bloom with his
&ldquo;wad&rdquo; and his prosperous, cheery smile.Needless to say J. Pinkney was no product of Georgia soil. He came out of that flushed
and capable region known as the &ldquo;North.&rdquo; He called himself a &ldquo;promoter&rdquo;; his enemies had
spoken of him as a &ldquo;grafter&rdquo;; Okochee took a middle course, and held him to be no better
nor no worse than a &ldquo;Yank.&rdquo;
Far up the lake&ndash;eighteen miles above the town&ndash;the eye of this cheerful camp-follower
of booms had spied out a graft. He purchased there a precipitous tract of five hundred acres
at forty-five cents per acre; and this he laid out and subdivided as the city of Skyland &ndash;the
Queen City of the Switzerland of the South. Streets and avenues were surveyed; parks
designed; corners of central squares reserved for the &ldquo;proposed&rdquo; opera house, board of
trade, lyceum, market, public schools, and &ldquo;Exposition Hall.&rdquo; The price of lots ranged from
five to five hundred dollars. Positively, no lot would be priced higher than five hundred
dollars.
While the boom was growing in Okochee, J. Pinkney&rsquo;s circulars, maps, and prospectuses
were flying through the mails to every part of the country. Investors sent in their money by
post, and the Skyland Real Estate Company (J. Pinkney Bloom) returned to each a deed, duly
placed on record, to the best lot, at the price, on hand that day. All this time the catamount
screeched upon the reserved lot of the Skyland Board of Trade, the opossum swung by his
tail over the site of the exposition hall, and the owl hooted a melancholy recitative to his
audience of young squirrels in opera house square. Later, when the money was coming in
fast, J. Pinkney caused to be erected in the coming city half a dozen cheap box houses, and
persuaded a contingent of indigent natives to occupy them, thereby assuming the role of
&ldquo;poulation&rdquo; in subsequent prospectuses, which became, accordingly, more seductive and
remunerative.
So, when the dream faded and Okochee dropped back to digging bait and nursing its
two and a half per cent. tax, J. Pinkney Bloom (unloving of checks and drafts and the cold
interrogatories of bankers) strapped about his fifty-two-inch waist a soft leather belt
containing eight thousand dollars in big bills, and said that all was very good.
One last trip he was making to Skyland before departing to other salad fields. Skyland
was a regular post-office, and the steamboat, Dixie Belle, under contract, delivered the mail
bag (generally empty) twice a week. There was a little business there to be settled &ndash;the
postmaster was to be paid off for his light but lonely services, and the &ldquo;inhabitants&rdquo; had to
be furnished with another month&rsquo;s homely rations, as per agreement. And then Skyland
would know J. Pinkney Bloom no more. The owners of these precipitous, barren, useless lots
might come and view the scene of their invested credulity, or they might leave them to their
fit tenants, the wild hog and the browsing deer. The work of the Skyland Real Estate
Company was finished.
The little steamboat Dixie Belle was about to shove off on her regular up-the-lake trip,
when a rickety hired carriage rattled up to the pier, and a tall, elderly gentleman, in black,
stepped out, signaling courteously but vivaciously for the boat to wait. Time was of the leastimportance in the schedule of the Dixie Belle; Captain MacFarland gave the order, and the
boat received its ultimate two passengers. For, upon the arm of the tall, elderly gentleman,
as he crossed the gangway, was a little elderly lady, with a gray curl depending quaintly
forward of her left ear.
Captain MacFarland was at the wheel; therefore it seemed to J. Pinkney Bloom, who
was the only other passenger, that it should be his to play the part of host to the boat&rsquo;s new
guests, who were, doubtless, on a scenery-viewing expedition. He stepped forward, with
that translucent, child-candid smile upon his fresh, pink countenance, with that air of
unaffected sincerity that was redeemed from bluffness only by its exquisite calculation, with
that promptitude and masterly decision of manner that so well suited his calling&ndash;with all his
stock in trade well to the front; he stepped forward to receive Colonel and Mrs. Peyton
Blaylock. With the grace of a grand marshal or a wedding usher, he escorted the two
passengers to a side of the upper deck, from which the scenery was supposed to present
itself to the observer in increased quantity and quality. There, in comfortable steamer chairs,
they sat and began to piece together the random lines that were to form an intelligent
paragraph in the big history of little events.
&ldquo;Our home, sir,&rdquo; said Colonel Blaylock, removing his wide-brimmed, rather shapeless
black felt hat, &ldquo;is in Holly Springs&ndash;Holly Springs, Georgia. I am very proud to make your
acquaintance, Mr. Bloom. Mrs. Blaylock and myself have just arrived in Okochee this
morning, sir, on business&ndash;business of importance in connection with the recent rapid march
of progress in this section of our state.&rdquo;
The Colonel smoothed back, with a sweeping gesture, his long, smooth, locks. His dark
eyes, still fiery under the heavy black brows, seemed inappropriate to the face of a business
man. He looked rather to be an old courtier handed down from the reign of Charles, and
re-attired in a modern suit of fine, but raveling and seam-worn, broadcloth.
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Bloom, in his heartiest prospectus voice, &ldquo;things have been whizzing
around Okochee. Biggest industrial revival and waking up to natural resources Georgia ever
had. Did you happen to squeeze in on the ground floor in any of the gilt- edged grafts,
Colonel?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the Colonel, hesitating in courteous doubt, &ldquo;if I understand your
question, I may say that I took the opportunity to make an investment that I believe will
prove quite advantageous&ndash;yes, sir, I believe it will result in both pecuniary profit and
agreeable occupation.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Colonel Blaylock,&rdquo; said the little edlerly lady, shaking her gray curl and smiling
indulgent explanation at J. Pinkney Bloom, &ldquo;is so devoted to businesss. He has such a talent
for financiering and markets and investments and those kind of things. I think myself
extremely fortunate in having secured him for a partner on life&rsquo;s journey&ndash;I am so unversed
in those formidable but very useful branches of learning.&ldquo;Colonel Blaylock rose and made a bow&ndash;a bow that belonged with silk stockings and
lace ruffles and velvet.
&ldquo;Practical affairs,&rdquo; he said, with a wave of his hand toward the promoter, &ldquo;are, if I may
use the comparison, the garden walks upon which we tread through life, viewing upon
either side of us the flowers which brighten that journey. It is my pleasure to be able to lay
out a walk or two. Mrs. Blaylock, sir, is one of those fortunate higher spirits whose mission it
is to make the flowers grow. Perhaps, Mr. Bloom, you have perused the lines of Lorella, the
Southern poetess. That is the name above which Mrs. Blaylock has contributed to the press
of the South for many years.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; said Mr. Bloom, with a sense of the loss clearly written upon his frank
face, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like the Colonel&ndash;in the walk-making business myself&ndash;and I haven&rsquo;t had time to
even take a sniff at the flowers. Poetry is a line I never dealt in. It must be nice, though
&ndash;quite nice.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is the region,&rdquo; smiled Mrs. Blaylock, &ldquo;in which my soul dwells. My shawl, Peyton, if
you please&ndash;the breeze comes a little chilly from yon verdured hills.&rdquo;
The Colonel drew from the tail pocket of his coat a small shawl of knitted silk and laid it
solicitously about the shoulders of the lady. Mrs. Blaylock sighed contentedly, and turned
her expressive eyes&ndash; still as clear and unworldly as a child&rsquo;s&ndash;upon the steep slopes that
were slowly slipping past. Very fair and stately they looked in the clear morning air. They
seemed to speak in familiar terms to the responsive spirit of Lorella. &ldquo;My native hills!&rdquo; she
murmured, dreamily. &ldquo;See how the foliage drinks the sunlight from the hollows and dells.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mrs. Blaylock&rsquo;s maiden days,&rdquo; said the Colonel, interpreting her mood to J. Pinkney
Bloom, &ldquo;were spent among the mountains of northern Georgia. Mountain air and mountain
scenery recall to her those days. Holly Springs, where we have lived for twenty years, is low
and flat. I fear that she may have suffered in health and spirits by so long a residence there.
That is one portent reason for the change we are making. My dear, can you not recall those
lines you wrote&ndash;entitled, I think, &lsquo;The Georgia Hills&rsquo;&ndash;the poem that was so extensively
copied by the Southern press and praised so highly by the Atlanta critics?&rdquo;
Mrs. Blaylock turned a glance of speaking tenderness upon the Colonel, fingered for a
moment the silvery curl that drooped upon her bosom, then looked again toward the
mountains. Without preliminary or affectation or demurral she began, in rather thrilling and
more deeply pitched tones to recite these lines:
&ldquo;The Georgia hills, the Georgia hills!&ndash;
Oh, heart, why dost thou pine?
Are not these sheltered lowlands fair
With mead and bloom and vine?Ah! as the slow-paced river here
Broods on its natal rills
My spirit drifts, in longing sweet,
Back to the Georgia hills.
&ldquo;And through the close-drawn, curtained night
I steal on sleep&rsquo;s slow wings
Back to my heart&rsquo;s ease&ndash;slopes of pine&ndash;
Where end my wanderings.
Oh, heaven seems nearer from their tops&ndash;
And farther earthly ills&ndash;
Even in dreams, if I may but
Dream of my Georgia hills.
The grass upon their orchard sides
Is a fine couch to me;
The common note of each small bird
Passes all minstrelsy.
It would not seem so dread a thing
If, when the Reaper wills,
He might come there and take my hand
Up in the Georgia hills.&rdquo;
Thats great stuff, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said J. Pinkney Bloom, enthusiastically, when the poetess had
concluded. &ldquo;I wish I had looked up poetry more than I have. I was raised in the pine hills
myself.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The mountains ever call to their children,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Blaylock. &ldquo;I feel that life will
take on the rosy hue of hope again in among these beautiful hills. Peyton&ndash;a little taste of the
currant wine, if you will be so good. The journey, though delightful in the extreme, slightly
fatigues me.&rdquo; Colonel Blaylock again visited the depths of his prolific coat, and produced a
tightly corked, rough, black bottle. Mr. Bloom was on his feet in an instant.
&ldquo;Let me bring a glass, ma&rsquo;am. You come along, Colonel&ndash;there&rsquo;s a little table we can
bring, too. Maybe we can scare up some fruit or a cup of tea on board. I&rsquo;ll ask Mac.&rdquo;
Mrs. Blaylock reclined at ease. Few royal ladies have held their royal prerogative with
the serene grace of the petted Southern woman. The Colonel, with an air as gallant and
assiduous as in the days of his courtship, and J. Pinkney Bloom, with a ponderous agility half
professional and half directed by some resurrected, unnamed, long- forgotten sentiment,
formed a diversified but attentive court. The currant wine&ndash;wine home made from the Holly
Springs fruit&ndash;went round, and then J. Pinkney began to hear something of Holly Springs life.
It seemed (from the conversation of the Blaylocks) that the Springs was decadent. A
third of the population had moved away. Business&ndash; and the Colonel was an authority onbusiness&ndash;had dwindled to nothing. After carefully studying the field of opportunities open
to capital he had sold his little property there for eight hundred dollars and invested it in one
of the enterprises opened up by the book in Okochee.
&ldquo;Might I inquire, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Bloom, &ldquo;in what particular line of business you inserted
your coin? I know that town as well as I know the regulations for illegal use of the mails. I
might give you a hunch as to whether you can make the game go or not.&rdquo;
J. Pinkney, somehow, had a kindly feeling toward these unsophisticated representatives
of by-gone days. They were so simple, impractical, and unsuspecting. He was glad that he
happened not to have a gold brick or a block of that western Bad Boy Silver Mine stock along
with him. He would have disliked to unload on people he liked so well as he did these; but
there are some temptations toe enticing to be resisted.
&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Colonel Blaylock. pausing to arrange the queen&rsquo;s wrap. &ldquo;I did not invest in
Okochee. I have made an exhaustive study of business conditions, and I regard old settled
towns as unfavorable fields in which to place capital that is limited in amount. Some months
ago, through the kindness of a friend, there came into my hands a map and description of
this new town of Skyland that has been built upon the lake. The description was so pleasing,
the future of the town set forth in such convincing arguments, and its increasing prosperity
portrayed in such an attractive style that I decided to take advantage of the opportunity it
offered. I carefully selected a lot in the centre of the business district, although its price was
the highest in the schedule&ndash;five hundred dollars&ndash;and made the purchase at once.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Are you the man&ndash;I mean, did you pay five hundred dollars for a lot in Skyland&rdquo; asked J.
Pinkney Bloom.
&ldquo;I did, sir,&rdquo; answered the Colonel, with the air of a modest millionaire explaining his
success; &ldquo;a lot most excellently situated on the same square with the opera house, and only
two squares from the board of trade. I consider the purchase a most fortuitous one. It is my
intention to erect a small building upon it at once, and open a modest book and stationery
store. During past years I have met with many pecuniary reverses, and I now find it
necessary to engage in some commercial occupation that will furnish me with a livelihood.
The book and stationery business, though an humble one, seems to me not inapt nor
altogether uncongenial. I am a graduate of the University of Virginia; and Mrs. Blaylock&rsquo;s
really wonderful acquaintance with belles-lettres and poetic literature should go far toward
insuring success. Of course, Mrs. Blaylock would not personally serve behind the counter.
With the nearly three hundred dollars I have remaining I can manage the building of a house,
by giving a lien on the lot. I have an old friend in Atlanta who is a partner in a large book
store, and he has agreed to furnish me with a stock of goods on credit, on extremely easy
terms. I am pleased to hope, sir, that Mrs. Blaylock&rsquo;s health and happiness will be increased
by the change of locality. Already I fancy I can perceive the return of those roses that were
once the hope and despair of Georgia cavaliers.&ldquo;Again followed that wonderful bow, as the Colonel lightly touched the pale cheek of the
poetess. Mrs. Blaylock, blushing like a girl, shook her curl and gave the Colonel an arch,
reproving tap. Secret of eternal youth&ndash;where art thou? Every second the answer
comes&ndash;&ldquo;Here, here, here.&rdquo; Listen to thine own heartbeats, 0 weary seeker after external
miracles.
&ldquo;Those years,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blaylock, &ldquo;in Holly Springs were long, long, long. But now is the
promised land in sight. Skyland!&ndash;a lovely name.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;we shall be able to secure comfortable accommodations
at some modest hotel at reasonable rates. Our trunks are in Okochee, to be forwarded when
we shall have made permanent arrangements.&rdquo;
J. Pinkney Bloom excused himself, went forward, and stood by the captain at the wheel.
&ldquo;Mac,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you remember my telling you once that I sold one of those
five-hundred-dollar lots in Skyland?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Seems I do,&rdquo; grinned Captain MacFarland.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a coward, as a general rule,&rdquo; went on the promoter, &ldquo;but I always said that if I
ever met the sucker that bought that lot I&rsquo;d run like a turkey. Now, you see that old
babe-in-the-wood over there? Well, he&rsquo;s the boy that drew the prize. That was the only
five-hundred-dollar lot that went. The rest ranged from ten dollars to two hundred. His wife
writes poetry. She&rsquo;s invented one about the high grounds of Georgia, that&rsquo;s way up in G.
They&rsquo;re going to Skyland to open a book store.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said MacFarland, with another grin, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a good thing you are along, J. P.; you
can show &lsquo;em around town until they begin to feel at home.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got three hundred dollars left to build a house and store with,&rdquo; went on J. Pinkney,
as if he were talking to himself. &ldquo;And he thinks there&rsquo;s an open house up there.&rdquo;
Captain MacFarland released the wheel long enough to give his leg a roguish slap.
&ldquo;You old fat rascal!&rdquo; he chuckled, with a wink.
&ldquo;Mac, you&rsquo;re a fool,&rdquo; said J. Pinkney Bloom, coldly. He went back and joined the
Blaylocks, where he sat, less talkative, with that straight furrow between his brows that
always stood as a signal of schemes being shaped within.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good many swindles connected with these booms,&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;What
if this Skyland should turn out to be one&ndash;that is, suppose business should be sort of dull
there, and no special sale for books?&ldquo;&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Colonel Blaylock, resting his hand upon the back of his wife&rsquo;s chair,
&ldquo;three times I have been reduced to almost penury by the duplicity of others, but I have not
yet lost faith in humanity. If I have been deceived again, still we may glean health and
content, if not worldly profit. I am aware that there are dishonest schemers in the world
who set traps for the unwary, but even they are not altogether bad. My dear, can you recall
those verses entitled &lsquo;He Giveth the Increase,&rsquo; that you composed for the choir of our church
in Holly Springs?&rdquo;
&ldquo;That was four years ago,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blaylock; &ldquo;perhans I can repeat a verse or two.
&ldquo;The lily springs from the rotting mould;
Pearls from the deep sea slime;
Good will come out of Nazareth
All in God&rsquo;s own time.
&ldquo;To the hardest heart the softening grace
Cometh, at last, to bless;
Guiding it right to help and cheer
And succor in distress.
&ldquo;I cannot remember the rest. The lines were not ambitious. They were written to the
music composed by a dear friend.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine rhyme, just the same,&rdquo; declared Mr. Bloom. &ldquo;It seems to ring the bell, all
right. I guess I gather the sense of it. It means that the rankest kind of a phony will give you
the best end of it once in a while.&rdquo;
Mr. Bloom strayed thoughtfully back to the captain, and stood meditating.
&ldquo;Ought to be in sight of the spires and gilded domes of Skyland now in a few minutes,&rdquo;
chirruped MacFarland, shaking with enjoyment.
&ldquo;Go to the devil,&rdquo; said Mr. Bloom, still pensive.
And now, upon the left bank, they caught a glimpse of a white village, high up on the
hills, smothered among green trees. That was Cold Branch&ndash;no boom town, but the slow
growth of many years. Cold Branch lay on the edge of the grape and corn lands. The big
country road ran just back of the heights. Cold Branch had nothing in common with the
frisky ambition of Okochee with its impertinent lake.
&ldquo;Mac,&rdquo; said J. Pinkney suddenly, &ldquo;I want you to stop at Cold Branch. There&rsquo;s a landing
there that they made to use sometimes when the river was up.&ldquo;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the captain, grinning more broadly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the United States mails on
board. Right to-day this boat&rsquo;s in the government service. Do you want to have the poor old
captain keelhauled by Uncle Sam? And the great city of Skyland, all disconsolate, waiting for
its mail? I&rsquo;m ashamed of your extravagance, J. P.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mac,&rdquo; almost whispered J. Pinkney, in his danger-line voice, &ldquo;I looked into the engine
room of the Dixie Belle a while ago. Don&rsquo;t you know of somebody that needs a new boiler?
Cement and black Japan can&rsquo;t hide flaws from me. And then, those shares of building and
loan that you traded for repairs&ndash;they were all yours, of course. I hate to mention these
things, but&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, come now, J. P.,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;You know I was just fooling. I&rsquo;ll put you off at
Cold Branch, if you say so.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The other passengers get off there, too,&rdquo; said Mr. Bloom.
Further conversation was held, and in ten minutes the Dixie Belle turned her nose
toward a little, cranky wooden pier on the left bank, and the captain, relinquishing the
wheel to a roustabout, came to the passenger deck and made the remarkable
announcement: &ldquo;All out for Skyland.&rdquo;
The Blaylocks and J. Pinkney Bloom disembarked, and the Dixie Belle proceeded on her
way up the lake. Guided by the indefatigable promoter, they slowly climbed the steep
hillside, pausing often to rest and admire the view. Finally they entered the village of Cold
Branch. Warmly both the Colonel and his wife praised it for its homelike and peaceful beauty.
Mr. Bloom conducted them to a two-story building on a shady street that bore the legend,
&ldquo;Pine-top Inn.&rdquo; Here he took his leave, receiving the cordial thanks of the two for his
attentions, the Colonel remarking that he thought they would spend the remainder of the
day in rest, and take a look at his purchase on the morrow.
J.Pinkney Bloom walked down Cold Branch&rsquo;s main street. He did not know this town,
but he knew towns, and his feet did not falter. Presently he saw a sign over a door: &ldquo;Frank E.
Cooly, Attorney-at-Law and Notary Public.&rdquo; A young man was Mr. Cooly, and awaiting
business.
&ldquo;Get your hat, son,&rdquo; said Mr. Bloom, in his breezy way, &ldquo;and a blank deed, and come
along. It&rsquo;s a job for you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he continued, when Mr. Cooly had responded with alacrity, &ldquo;is there a
bookstore in town?&rdquo;
&ldquo;One,&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;Henry Williams&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Get there,&rdquo; said Mr. Bloom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to buy it.&ldquo;Henry Williams was behind his counter. His store was a small one, containing a mixture
of books, stationery, and fancy rubbish. Adjoining it was Henry&rsquo;s home&ndash;a decent cottage,
vine-embowered and cosy. Henry was lank and soporific, and not inclined to rush his
business.
&ldquo;I want to buy your house and store,&rdquo; said Mr. Bloom. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got time to
dicker&ndash;name your price.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth eight hundred,&rdquo; said Henry, too much dazed to ask more than its value.
&ldquo;Shut that door,&rdquo; said Mr. Bloom to the lawyer. Then he tore off his coat and vest, and
began to unbutton his shirt.
&ldquo;Wanter fight about it, do yer?&rdquo; said Henry Williams, jumping up and cracking his heels
together twice. &ldquo;All right, hunky&ndash;sail in and cut yer capers.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Keep your clothes on,&rdquo; said Mr. Bloom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only going down to the bank.&rdquo;
He drew eight one-hundred-dollar bills from his money belt and planked them down on
the counter. Mr. Cooly showed signs of future promise, for he already had the deed spread
out, and was reaching across the counter for the ink bottle. Never before or since was such
quick action had in Cold Branch.
&ldquo;Your name, please?&rdquo; asked the lawyer.
&ldquo;Make it out to Peyton Blaylock,&rdquo; said Mr. Bloom. &ldquo;God knows how to spell it.&rdquo;
Within thirty minutes Henry Williams was out of business, and Mr. Bloom stood on the
brick sidewalk with Mr. Cooly, who held in his hand the signed and attested deed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the party at the Pinetop Inn,&rdquo; said J. Pinkney Bloom. &ldquo;Get it recorded, and
take it down and give it to him. He&rsquo;ll ask you a hell&rsquo;s mint of questions; so here&rsquo;s ten dollars
for the trouble you&rsquo;ll have in not being able to answer &lsquo;em. Never run much to poetry, did
you, young man?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the really talented Cooly, who even yet retained his right mind, &ldquo;now and
then.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dig into it,&rdquo; said Mr. Bloom, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll pay you. Never heard a poem, now, that run
something like this, did you?&ndash;
A good thing out of Nazareth
Comes up sometimes, I guess,On hand, all right, to help and cheer
A sucker in distress.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I believe not,&rdquo; said Mr. Cooly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hymn,&rdquo; said J. Pinkney Bloom. &ldquo;Now, show me the way to a livery stable, son, for
I&rsquo;m going to hit the dirt road back to Okochee.&rdquo;
Past One At Rodney&rsquo;s （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Only on the lower East Side of New York do the houses of Capulet and Montagu survive.
There they do not fight by the book of arithmetic. If you but bite your thumb at an upholder
of your opposing house you have work cut out for your steel. On Broadway you may drag
your man along a dozen blocks by his nose, and he will only bawl for the watch; but in the
domain of the East Side Tybalts and Mercutios you must observe the niceties of deportment
to the wink of any eyelash and to an inch of elbow room at the bar when its patrons include
foes of your house and kin.
So, when Eddie McManus, known to the Capulets as Cork McManus, drifted into Dutch
Mike&rsquo;s for a stein of beer, and came upon a bunch of Montagus making merry with the suds,
he began to observe the strictest parliamentary rules. Courtesy forbade his leaving the
saloon with his thirst unslaked; caution steered him to a place at the bar where the mirror
supplied the cognizance of the enemy&rsquo;s movements that his indifferent gaze seemed to
disdain; experience whispered to him that the finger of trouble would be busy among the
chattering steins at Dutch Mike&rsquo;s that night. Close by his side drew Brick Cleary, his Mercutio,
companion of his perambulations. Thus they stood, four of the Mulberry Hill Gang and two
fo the Dry Dock Gang, minding their P&rsquo;s and Q&rsquo;s so solicitously that Dutch Mike kept one eye
on his customers and the other on an open space beneath his bar in which it was his custom
to seek safety whenever the ominous politeness of the rival associations congealed into the
shapes of bullets and cold steel.
But we have not to do with the wars of the Mulberry Hills and the Dry Docks. We must
to Rooney&rsquo;s, where, on the most blighted dead branch of the tree of life, a little pale orchid
shall bloom.
Overstrained etiquette at last gave way. It is not known who first overstepped the
bounds of punctilio; but the consequences were immediate. Buck Malone, of the Mulberry
Hills, with a Dewey-like swiftness, got an eight-inch gun swung round from his hurricane
deck. But McManus&rsquo;s simile must be the torpedo. He glided in under the guns and slipped a
scant three inches of knife blade between the ribs of the Mulberry Hill cruiser. Meanwhile
Brick Cleary, a devotee to strategy, had skimmed across the lunch counter and thrown theswitch of the electrics, leaving the combat to be waged by the light of gunfire alone. Dutch
Mike crawled from his haven and ran into the street crying for the watch instead of for a
Shakespeare to immortalize the Cimmerian shindy.
The cop came, and found a prostrate, bleeding Montagu supported by three distrait
and reticent followers of the House. Faithful to the ethics of the gangs, no one knew whence
the hurt came. There was no Capulet to be seen.
&ldquo;Raus mit der interrogatories,&rdquo; said Buck Malone to the officer. &ldquo;Sure I know who done
it. I always manages to get a bird&rsquo;s eye view of any guy that comes up an&rsquo; makes a show case
for a hardware store out of me. No. I&rsquo;m not telling you his name. I&rsquo;ll settle with um meself.
Wow - ouch! Easy, boys! Yes, I&rsquo;ll attend to his case meself. I&rsquo;m not making any complaint.&rdquo;
At midnight McManus strolled around a pile of lumber near an East Side dock, and
lingered in the vicinity of a certain water plug. Brick Cleary drifted casually to the trysting
place ten minutes later. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll maybe not croak,&rdquo; said Brick; &ldquo;and he won&rsquo;t tell, of course. But
Dutch Mike did. He told the police he was tired of having his place shot up. It&rsquo;s unhandy just
now, because Tim Corrigan&rsquo;s in Europe for a week&rsquo;s end with Kings. He&rsquo;ll be back on the
Kaiser Williams next Friday. You&rsquo;ll have to duck out of sight till then. Tim&rsquo;ll fix it up all right
for us when he comes back.&rdquo;
This goes to explain why Cork McManus went into Rooney&rsquo;s one night and there looked
upon the bright, stranger face of Romance for the first time in his precarious career.
Until Tim Corrigan should return from his jaunt among Kings and Princes and hold up
his big white finger in private offices, it was unsafe for Cork in any of the old haunts of his
gang. So he lay, perdu, in the high rear room of a Capulet, reading pink sporting sheets and
cursing the slow paddle wheels of the Kaiser Wilhelm.
It was on Thursday evening that Cork&rsquo;s seclusion became intolerable to him. Never a
hart panted for water fountain as he did for the cool touch of a drifting stein, for the firm
security of a foot-rail in the hollow of his shoe and the quiet, hearty challenges of friendship
and repartee along and across the shining bars. But he must avoid the district where he was
known. The cops were looking for him everywhere, for news was scarce, and the
newspapers were harping again on the failure of the police to suppress the gangs. If they got
him before Corrigan came back, the big white finger could not be uplifted; it would be too
late then. But Corrigan would be home the next day, so he felt sure there would be small
danger in a little excursion that night among the crass pleasures that represented life to him.
At half-past twelve McManus stood in a darkish cross-town street looking up at the
name &ldquo;Rooney&rsquo;s,&rdquo; picked out by incandescent lights against a signboard over a second-story
window. He had heard of the place as a tough &ldquo;hang-out&rdquo;; with its frequenters and its
locality he was unfamiliar. Guided by certain unerring indications common to all such resorts,
he ascended the stairs and entered the large room over the caf&rsquo;e.Here were some twenty or thirty tables, at this time about half-filled with Rooney&rsquo;s
guests. Waiters served drinks. At one end a human pianola with drugged eyes hammered
the keys with automatic and furious unprecision. At merciful intervals a waiter would roar or
squeak a song - songs full of &ldquo;Mr. Jonsons&rdquo; and &ldquo;babes&rdquo; and &ldquo;coons&rdquo; - historical word
guaranties of the genuineness of African melodies composed by red waistcoated young
gentlemen, natives of the cotton fields and rice swamps of West Twenty-eighth Street.
For one brief moment you must admire Rooney with me as he receives, seats,
manipulates, and chaffs his guests. He is twenty-nine. He has Wellington&rsquo;s nose, Dante&rsquo;s chin,
the cheek-bones of an Iroquois, the smile of Talleyrand, Corbett&rsquo;s foot work, and the pose of
an eleven-year-old East Side Central Park Queen of the May. He is assisted by a lieutenant
known as Frank, a pudgy, easy chap, swell-dressed, who goes among the tables seeing that
dull care does not intrude. Now, what is there about Rooney&rsquo;s to inspire all this pother? It is
more respectable by daylight; stout ladies with children and mittens and bundles and
unpedigreed dogs drop up of afternoons for a stein and a chat. Even by gaslight the
diversions are melancholy i&rsquo; the mouth - drink and rag-time, and an occasional surprise
when the waiter swabs the suds from under your sticky glass. There is an answer.
Transmigration! The soul of Sir Walter Raleigh has traveled from beneath his slashed doublet
to a kindred home under Rooney&rsquo;s visible plaid waistcoat. Rooney&rsquo;s is twenty years ahead of
the times. Rooney has removed the embargo. Rooney has spread his cloak upon the soggy
crossing of public opinion, and any Elizabeth who treads upon it is as much a queen as
another. Attend to the revelation of the secret. In Rooney&rsquo;s ladies may smoke!
McManus sat down at a vacant table. He paid for the glass of beer that he ordered,
tilted his narrow-brimmed derby to the back of his brick-dust head, twined his feet among
the rungs of his chair, and heaved a sigh of contentment from the breathing spaces of his
innermost soul; for this mud honey was clarified sweetness to his taste. The sham gaiety, the
hectic glow of counterfeit hospitality, the self-conscious, joyless laughter, the wine-born
warmth, the loud music retrieving the hour from frequent whiles of awful and corroding
silence, the presence of well-clothed and frank-eyed beneficiaries of Rooney&rsquo;s removal of
the restrictions laid upon the weed, the familiar blended odors of soaked lemon peel, flat
beer, and peau d&rsquo;Espagne - all these were manna to Cork McManus, hungry for his week in
the desert of the Capulet&rsquo;s high rear room.
A girl, alone, entered Rooney&rsquo;s, glanced around with leisurely swiftness, and sat
opposite McManus at his table. Her eyes rested upon him for two seconds in the look with
which woman reconnoitres all men whom she for the first time confronts. In that space of
time she will decide upon one of two things - either to scream for the police, or that she
may marry him later on.
Her brief inspection concluded, the girl laid on the table a worn red morocco shopping
bag with the inevitable top-gallant sail of frayed lace handkerchief flying from a corner of it.
After she had ordered a small beer from the immediate waiter she took from her bag a boxof cigarettes and lighted one with slightly exaggerated ease of manner. Then she looked
again in the eyes of Cork McManus and smiled.
Instantly the doom of each was sealed.
The unqualified desire of a man to buy clothes and build fires for a woman for a whole
lifetime at first sight of her is not uncommon among that humble portion of humanity that
does not care for Bradstreet or coats-of-arms or Shaw&rsquo;s plays. Love at first sight has occurred
a time or two in high life; but, as a rule, the extempore mania is to be found among
unsophisticated cratures such as the dove, the blue-tailed dingbat, and the
ten-dollar-a-week clerk. Poets, subscribers to all fiction magazines, and schatchens, take
notice.
With the exchange of the mysterious magnetic current came to each of them the
instant desire to lie, pretend, dazzle and deceive, which is the worst thing about the
hypocritical disorder known as love.
&ldquo;Have another beer?&rdquo; suggested Cork. In his circle the phrase was considered to be a
card, accompanied by a letter of introduction and references.
&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; said the girl, raising her eyebrows and choosing her conventional words
carefully. &ldquo;I - merely dropped in for - a slight refreshment.&rdquo; The cigarette between her fingers
seemed to require explanation. &ldquo;My aunt is a Russian lady,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;and we often
have a post perannual cigarette after dinner at home.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cheese it!&rdquo; said Cork, whom society airs oppressed. &ldquo;Your fingers are as yellow as
mine.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said the girl, blazing upon him with low-voiced indignation, &ldquo;what do you think I
am? Say, who do you think you are talking to? What?&rdquo;
She was pretty to look at. Her eyes were big, brown, intrepid and bright. Uner her flat
sailor hat, planted jauntily on one side, her crinkly, tawny hair parted and was drawn back.
low and massy, in a thick, pendant knot behind. The roundness of girlhood still lingered in
her chin and neck, but her cheeks and fingers were thinning slightly. She looked upon the
world with defiance, suspicion, and sullen wonder. Her smart, short tan coat was soiled and
expensive. Two inches below her black dress dropped the lowest flounce of a heliotrope silk
underskirt.
&ldquo;Beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Cork, looking at her admiringly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean anything. Sure,
it&rsquo;s no harm to smoke, Maudy.&ldquo;&ldquo;Rooney&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the girl, softened at once by his amends, &ldquo;is the only place I know
where a lady can smoke. Maybe it ain&rsquo;t a nice habit, but aunty lets us at home. And my
name ain&rsquo;t Maudy, if you please; it&rsquo;s Ruby Delamere.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a swell handle,&rdquo; said Cork approvingly. &ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s McManus - Cor - er - Eddie
McManus.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; laughed Ruby. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize.&rdquo;
Cork looked seriously at the big clock on Rooney&rsquo;s wall. The girl&rsquo;s ubiquitous eyes took
in the movement.
&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s late,&rdquo; she said, reaching for her bag; &ldquo;but you know how you want a smoke
when you want one. Ain&rsquo;t Rooney&rsquo;s all right? I never saw anything wrong here. This is twice
I&rsquo;ve been in. I work in a bookbindery on Third Avenue. A lot of us girls have been working
overtime three nights a week. They won&rsquo;t let you smoke there, of course. I just dropped in
here on my way home for a puff. Ain&rsquo;t it all right in here? If it ain&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t come any more.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little bit late for you to be out alone anywhere,&rdquo; said Cork. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not wise to this
particular joint; but anyhow you don&rsquo;t want to have your picture taken in it for a present to
your Sunday School teacher. Have one more beer, and then say I take you home.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know you,&rdquo; said the girl, with fine scrupulosity. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t accept the company
of gentlemen I ain&rsquo;t acquainted with. My aunt never would allow that.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Cork McManus, pulling his ear, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the latest thing in suitings with side
vents and bell skirt when it comes to escortin&rsquo; a lady. You bet you&rsquo;ll find me all right, Ruby.
And I&rsquo;ll give you a tip as to who I am. My governor is one of the hottest cross-buns of the
Wall Street push. Morgan&rsquo;s cab horse casts a shoe every time the old man sticks his head out
the window. Me! Well, I&rsquo;m in trainin&rsquo; down the Street. The old man&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to put a seat on
the Stock Exchange in my stockin&rsquo; my next birthday. But it all sounds like a lemon to me.
What I like is golf and yachtin&rsquo; and - er - well, say a corkin&rsquo; fast ten-round bout between
welter-weights with walkin&rsquo; gloves.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I guess you can walk to the door with me,&rdquo; said the girl hesitatingly, but with a certain
pleased flutter. &ldquo;Still I never heard anything extra good about Wall Street brokers, or sport
who go to prize fights, either. Ain&rsquo;t you got any other recommendations?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re the swellest looker I&rsquo;ve had my lamps on in little old New York,&rdquo; said Cork
impressively.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be about enough of that, now. Ain&rsquo;t you the kidder!&rdquo; She modified her chiding
words by a deep, long, beaming, smile-embellished look at her cavalier. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drink our beer
before we go, ha?&ldquo;A waiter sang. The tobacco smoke grew denser, drifting and rising in spirals, waves,
tilted layers, cumulus clouds, cataracts and suspended fogs like some fifth element created
from the ribs of the ancient four. Laughter and chat grew louder, stimulated by Rooney&rsquo;s
liquids and Rooney&rsquo;s gallant hospitality to Lady Nicotine.
One o&rsquo;clock struck. Down-stairs there was a sound of closing and locking doors. Frank
pulled down the green shades of the front windows carefully. Rooney went below in the
dark hall and stood at the front door, his cigarette cached in the hollow of his hand.
Thenceforth whoever might seek admittance must present a countenance familiar to
Rooney&rsquo;s hawk&rsquo;s eye - the countenance of a true sport.
Cork McManus and the bookbindery girl conversed absorbedly, with their elbows on
the table. Their glasses of beer were pushed to one side, scarcely touched, with the foam on
them sunken to a thin white scum. Since the stroke of one the stale pleasures of Rooney&rsquo;s
had become renovated and spiced; not by any addition to the list of distractions, but
because from that moment the sweets became stolen ones. The flattest glass of beer
acquired the tang of illegality; the mildest claret punch struck a knockout blow at law and
order; the harmless and genial company became outlaws, defying authority and rule. For
after the stroke of one in such places as Rooney&rsquo;s, where neither bed nor board is to be had,
drink may not be set before the thirsty of the city of the four million. It is the law.
&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Cork McManus, almost covering the table with his eloquent chest and
elbows, &ldquo;was that dead straight about you workin&rsquo; in the bookbindery and livin&rsquo; at home -
and just happenin&rsquo; in here - and - and all that spiel you gave me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sure it was,&rdquo; answered the girl with spirit. &ldquo;Why, what do you think? Do you suppose
I&rsquo;d lie to you? Go down to the shop and ask &lsquo;em. I handed it to you on the level.&rdquo;
&ldquo;On the dead level?&rdquo; said Cork. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I want it; because -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Because what?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I throw up my hands,&rdquo; said Cork. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me goin&rsquo;. You&rsquo;re the girl I&rsquo;ve been lookin&rsquo;
for. Will you keep company with me, Ruby?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Would you like me to - Eddie?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Surest thing. But I wanted a straight story about - about yourself, you know. When a
fellow had a girl - a steady girl - she&rsquo;s got to be all right, you know. She&rsquo;s got to be straight
goods.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find I&rsquo;ll be straight goods, Eddie.&rdquo;&ldquo;Of course you will. I believe what you told me. But you can&rsquo;t blame me for wantin&rsquo; to
find out. You don&rsquo;t see many girls smokin&rsquo; cigarettes in places like Rooney&rsquo;s after midnight
that are like you.&rdquo;
The girl flushed a little and lowered her eyes. &ldquo;I see that now,&rdquo; she said meekly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know how bad it looked. But I won&rsquo;t do it any more. And I&rsquo;ll go straight home every night
and stay there. And I&rsquo;ll give up cigarettes if you say so, Eddie - I&rsquo;ll cut &lsquo;em out from this
minute on.&rdquo;
Cork&rsquo;s air became judicial, proprietary, condemnatory, yet sympathetic. &ldquo;A lady can
smoke,&rdquo; he decided, slowly, &ldquo;at times and places . Why? Because it&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; a lady that helps
her pull it off.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to quit. There&rsquo;s nothing to it,&rdquo; said the girl. She flicked the stub of her
cigarette to the floor.
&ldquo;At times and places,&rdquo; repeated Cork. &ldquo;When I call round for you of evenin&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ll hunt
out a dark bench in Stuyvesant Square and have a puff or two. But no more Rooney&rsquo;s at one
o&rsquo;clock - see?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Eddie, do you really like me?&rdquo; The girl searchd his hard but frank features eagerly with
anxious eyes.
&ldquo;On the dead level.&rdquo;
&ldquo;When are you coming to see me - where I live?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thursday - day after to-morrow evenin&rsquo;. That suit you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;ll be ready for you. Come about seven. Walk to the door with me to-night and
I&rsquo;ll show you where I live. Don&rsquo;t forget, now. And don&rsquo;t you go to see any other girls before
then, mister! I bet you will, though.&rdquo;
&ldquo;On the dead level,&rdquo; said Cork, &ldquo;you make &lsquo;em all look like rag-dolls to me. Honest, you
do. I know when I&rsquo;m suited. On the dead level, I do.&rdquo;
Against the front door down-stairs repeated heavy blows were delivered. The loud
crashes resounded in the room above. Only a trip-hammer or a policeman&rsquo;s foot could have
been the author of those sounds. Rooney jumped like a bullfrog to a corner of the room,
turned off the electric lights and hurried swiftly below. The room was left utterly dark except
for the winking red glow of cigars and cigarettes. A second volley of crashes came up from
the assaulted door. A little, rustling, murmuring panic moved among the besieged guests.
Frank, cool, smooth, reassuring, could be seen in the rosy glow of the burning tobacco, going
from table to table.&ldquo;All keep still!&rdquo; was his caution. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk or make any noise! Everything will be all
right. Now, don&rsquo;t feel the slightest alarm. We&rsquo;ll take care of you all.&rdquo;
Ruby felt across the table until Cork&rsquo;s firm hand closed upon hers. &ldquo;Are you afraid,
Eddie?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Are you afraid you&rsquo;ll get a free ride?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; doin&rsquo; in the teeth-chatterin&rsquo; line,&rdquo; said Cork. &ldquo;I guess Rooney&rsquo;s been slow with
his envelope. Don&rsquo;t you worry, girly; I&rsquo;ll look out for you all right.&rdquo;
Yet Mr. McManus&rsquo;s ease was only skin-and muscle-deep. With the police looking
everywhere for Buck Malone&rsquo;s assailant, and with Corrigan still on the ocean wave, he felt
that to be caught in a police raid would mean an ended career for him. He wished he had
remained in the high rear room of the true Capulet reading the pink extras.
Rooney seemed to have opened the front door below and engaged the police in
conference in the dark hall. The wordless low growl of their voices came up the stairway.
Frank made a wireless news station of himself at the upper door. Suddenly he closed the
door, hurried to the extreme rear of the room and lighted a dim gas jet.
&ldquo;This way, everybody!&rdquo; he called sharply. &ldquo;In a hurry; but no noise, please!&rdquo;
The guests crowded in confusion to the rear. Rooney&rsquo;s lieutenant swung open a panel in
the wall, overlooking the back yard, revealing a ladder already placed for the escape.
&ldquo;Down and out, everybody!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Ladies first! Less talking, please! Don&rsquo;t
crowd! There&rsquo;s no danger.&rdquo;
Among the last, Cork and Ruby waited their turn at the open panel. Suddenly she swept
him aside and clung to his arm fiercely.
&ldquo;Before we go out,&rdquo; she whispered in his ear - &ldquo;before anything happens, tell me again,
Eddie, do you l - do you really like me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;On the dead level,&rdquo; said Cork, holding her close with one arm, &ldquo;when it comes to you,
I&rsquo;m all in.&rdquo;
When they turned they found they were lost and in darkness. The last of the fleeing
customers had descended. Half way across the yard they bore the ladder, stumbling, giggling,
hurrying to place it against adjoining low building over the roof of which their only route to
safety.
&ldquo;We may as well sit down,&rdquo; said Cork grimly. &ldquo;Maybe Rooney will stand the cops off,
anyhow.&ldquo;They sat at a table; and their hands came together again.
A number of men then entered the dark room, feeling their way about. One of them,
Rooney himself, found the switch and turned on the electric light. The other man was a cop
of the old regime - a big cop, a thick cop, a fuming, abrupt cop - not a pretty cop. He went up
to the pair at the table and sneered familiarly at the girl.
&ldquo;What are youse doin&rsquo; in here?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Dropped in for a smoke,&rdquo; said Cork mildly.
&ldquo;Had any drinks?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not later than one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Get out - quick!&rdquo; ordered the cop. Then, &ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; he countermanded.
He took off Cork&rsquo;s hat roughly and scrutinized him shrewdly. &ldquo;Your name&rsquo;s McManus.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bad guess,&rdquo; said Cork. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Peterson.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cork McManus, or something like that,&rdquo; said the cop. &ldquo;You put a knife into a man in
Dutch Mike&rsquo;s saloon a week ago.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Aw, forget it!&rdquo; said Cork, who perceived a shade of doubt in the officer&rsquo;s tones. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
got my mug mixed with somebody else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Have I? Well, you&rsquo;ll come to the station with me, anyhow, and be looked over. The
description fits you all right.&rdquo; The cop twisted his fingers under Cork&rsquo;s collar. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he
ordered roughly.
Cork glanced at Ruby. She was pale, and her thin nostrils quivered. Her quick eye
danced from one man&rsquo;s face to the other as they spoke or moved. What hard luck! Cork was
thinking - Corrigan on the briny; and Ruby met and lost almost within an hour! Somebody at
the police station would recognize him, without a doubt. Hard luck!
But suddenly the girl sprang up and hurled herself with both arms extended against the
cop. His hold on Cork&rsquo;s collar was loosened and he stumbled back two or three paces.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go so fast, Maguire!&rdquo; she cried in shrill fury. &ldquo;Keep your hands off my man! You
know me, and you know I&rsquo;m givin&rsquo; you good advice. Don&rsquo;t you touch him again! He&rsquo;s not the
guy you are lookin&rsquo; for - I&rsquo;ll stand for that.&ldquo;&ldquo;See here, Fanny,&rdquo; said the Cop, red and angry, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you, too, if you don&rsquo;t look out!
How do you know this ain&rsquo;t the man I want? What are you doing in here with him?&rdquo;
&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; said the girl, flaming red and white by turns. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve known
him a year. He&rsquo;s mine. Oughtn&rsquo;t I to know? And what am I doin&rsquo; here with him? That&rsquo;s easy.&rdquo;
She stooped low and reached down somewhere into a swirl of flirted draperies,
heliotrope and black. An elastic snapped, she threw on the table toward Cork a folded wad
of bills. The money slowly straightened itself with little leisurely jerks.
&ldquo;Take that, Jimmy, and let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m declarin&rsquo; the usual dividends,
Maguire,&rdquo; she said to the officer. &ldquo;You had your usual five-dollar graft at the usual corner at
ten.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A lie!&rdquo; said the cop, turning purple. &ldquo;You go on my beat again and I&rsquo;ll arrest you every
time I see you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you why. Witnesses saw me give you the
money to-night, and last week, too. I&rsquo;ve been getting fixed for you.&rdquo;
Cork put the wad of money carefuly into his pocket, and said: &ldquo;Come on, Fanny; let&rsquo;s
have some chop suey before we go home.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Clear out, quick, both of you, or I&rsquo;ll -&rdquo;
The cop&rsquo;s bluster trailed away into inconsequentiality.
At the corner of the street the two halted. Cork handed back the money without a
word. The girl took it and slipped it slowly into her hand-bag. Her expression was the same
she had worn when she entered Rooney&rsquo;s that night - she looked upon the world with
defiance, suspicion and sullen wonder.
&ldquo;I guess I might as well say good-bye here,&rdquo; she said dully. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t want to see me
again, of course. Will you - shake hands - Mr. McManus.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I mightn&rsquo;t have got wise if you hadn&rsquo;t give the snap away,&rdquo; said Cork. &ldquo;Why did you do
it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have been pinched if I hadn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s why. Ain&rsquo;t that reason enough?&rdquo; Then she
began to cry. &ldquo;Honest, Eddie, I was goin&rsquo; to be the best girl in the world. I hated to be what I
am; I hated men; I was ready almost to die when I saw you. And you seemed different from
everybody else. And when I found you liked me, too, why, I thought I&rsquo;d make you believe I
was good, and I was goin&rsquo; to be good. When you asked to come to my house and see me,why, I&rsquo;d have died rather than do anything wrong after that. But what&rsquo;s the use of talking
about it? I&rsquo;ll say good-by, if you will, Mr. McManus.&rdquo;
Cork was pulling at his ear. &ldquo;I knifed Malone,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was the one the cop wanted.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the girl listlessly. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t make any difference about that.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That was all hot air about Wall Street. I don&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; but hang out with a tough
gang on the East Side.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That was all right, too,&rdquo; repeated the girl. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t make any difference.&rdquo;
Cork straightened himself, and pulled his hat down low. &ldquo;I could get a job at O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
he said aloud, but to himself.
&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said the girl.
&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Cork, taking her arm. &ldquo;I know a place.&rdquo;
Two blocks away he turned with her up the steps of a red brick house facing a little
park.
&ldquo;What house is this?&rdquo; she asked, drawing back. &ldquo;Why are you going in there?&rdquo;
A street lamp shone brightly in front. There was a brass nameplate at one side of the
closed front doors. Cork drew her firmly up the steps. &ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; said he.
She looked at the name on the plate, and gave a cry between a moan and a scream.
&ldquo;No, no, no, Eddie! Oh, my God, no! I won&rsquo;t let you do that - not now! Let me go! You shan&rsquo;t
do that! You can&rsquo;t - you mus&rsquo;n&rsquo;t! Not after you know! No, no! Come away quick! Oh, my God!
Please, Eddie, come!&rdquo;
Half fainting, she reeled, and was caught in the bend of his arm. Cork&rsquo;s right hand felt
for the electric button and pressed it long.
Another cop - how quickly they scent trouble when trouble is on the wing! - came along,
saw them, and ran up the steps. &ldquo;Here! What are you doing with that girl?&rdquo; he called gruffly.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be all right in a minute,&rdquo; said Cork. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a straight deal.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Reverend Jeremiah Jones,&rdquo; read the cop from the door-plate with true detective
cunning.
&ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; said Cork. &ldquo;On the dead level, we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to get married.&ldquo;The Pimienta Pancakes （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>While we were rounding up a bunch of the Triangle-O cattle in the Frio bottoms a
projecting branch of a dead mesquite caught my wooden stirrup and gave my ankle a
wrench that laid me up in camp for a week.
On the third day of my compulsory idleness I crawled out near the grub wagon, and
reclined helpless under the conversational fire of Judson Odom, the camp cook. Jud was a
monologist by nature, whom Destiny, with customary blundering, had set in a profession
wherein he was bereaved, for the greater portion of his time, of an audience.
Therefore, I was manna in the desert of Jud&rsquo;s obmutescence.
Betimes I was stirred by invalid longings for something to eat that did not come under
the caption of &ldquo;grub.&rdquo; I had visions of the maternal pantry &ldquo;deep as first love, and wild with
all regret,&rdquo; and then I asked:
&ldquo;Jud, can you make pancakes?&rdquo;
Jud laid down his six-shooter, with which he was preparing to pound an antelope steak,
and stood over me in what I felt to be a menacing attitude. He further endorsed my
impression that his pose was resentful by fixing upon me with his light blue eyes a look of
cold suspicion.
&ldquo;Say, you,&rdquo; he said, with candid, though not excessive, choler, &ldquo;did you mean that
straight, or was you trying to throw the gaff into me? Some of the boys been telling you
about me and that pancake racket?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, Jud,&rdquo; I said, sincerely, &ldquo;I meant it. It seems to me I&rsquo;d swap my pony and saddle for
a stack of buttered brown pancakes with some first crop, open kettle, New Orleans
sweetening. Was there a story about pancakes?&rdquo;
Jud was mollified at once when he saw that I had not been dealing in allusions. He
brought some mysterious bags and tin boxes from the grub wagon and set them in the
shade of the hackberry where I lay reclined. I watched him as he began to arrange them
leisurely and untie their many strings.&ldquo;No, not a story,&rdquo; said Jud, as he worked, &ldquo;but just the logical disclosures in the case of
me and that pink-eyed snoozer from Mired Mule Canada and Miss Willella Learight. I don&rsquo;t
mind telling you.
&ldquo;I was punching then for old Bill Toomey, on the San Miguel. One day I gets all ensnared
up in aspirations for to eat some canned grub that hasn&rsquo;t ever mooed or baaed or grunted or
been in peck measures. So, I gets on my bronc and pushes the wind for Uncle Emsley Telfair&rsquo;s
store at the Pimienta Crossing on the Nueces.
&ldquo;About three in the afternoon I throwed my bridle rein over a mesquite limb and
walked the last twenty yards into Uncle Emsley&rsquo;s store. I got up on the counter and told
Uncle Emsley that the signs pointed to the devastation of the fruit crop of the world. In a
minute I had a bag of crackers and a long-handled spoon, with an open can each of apricots
and pineapples and cherries and greengages beside of me with Uncle Emsley busy chopping
away with the hatchet at the yellow clings. I was feeling like Adam before the apple
stampede, and was digging my spurs into the side of the counter and working with my
twenty-four-inch spoon when I happened to look out of the window into the yard of Uncle
Emsley&rsquo;s house, which was next to the store.
&ldquo;There was a girl standing there&ndash;an imported girl with fixings on&ndash; philandering with a
croquet maul and amusing herself by watching my style of encouraging the fruit canning
industry.
&ldquo;I slid off the counter and delivered up my shovel to Uncle Emsley.
&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s my niece,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;Miss Willella Learight, down from Palestine on a visit. Do
you want that I should make you acquainted?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;The Holy Land,&rsquo; I says to myself, my thoughts milling some as I tried to run &lsquo;em into
the corral. &lsquo;Why not? There was sure angels in Pales&ndash;Why, yes, Uncle Emsley,&rsquo; I says out loud,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;d be awful edified to meet Miss Learight.&rsquo;
&ldquo;So Uncle Emsley took me out in the yard and gave us each other&rsquo;s entitlements.
&ldquo;I never was shy about women. I never could understand why some men who can
break a mustang before breakfast and shave in the dark, get all left-handed and full of
perspiration and excuses when they see a bold of calico draped around what belongs to it.
Inside of eight minutes me and Miss Willella was aggravating the croquet balls around as
amiable as second cousins. She gave me a dig about the quantity of canned fruit I had eaten,
and I got back at her, flat-footed, about how a certain lady named Eve started the fruit
trouble in the first free-grass pasture&ndash;&lsquo;Over in Palestine, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; says I, as easy and pat as
roping a one-year-old.&ldquo;That was how I acquired cordiality for the proximities of Miss Willella Learight; and the
disposition grew larger as time passed. She was stopping at Pimienta Crossing for her health,
which was very good, and for the climate, which was forty per cent. hotter than Palestine. I
rode over to see her once every week for a while; and then I figured it out that if I doubled
the number of trips I would see her twice as often.
&ldquo;One week I slipped in a third trip; and that&rsquo;s where the pancakes and the pink-eyed
snoozer busted into the game.
&ldquo;That evening, while I set on the counter with a peach and two damsons in my mouth, I
asked Uncle Emsley how Miss Willella was.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; says Uncle Emsley, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s gone riding with Jackson Bird, the sheep man from
over at Mired Mule Canada.&rsquo;
&ldquo;I swallowed the peach seed and the two damson seeds. I guess somebody held the
counter by the bridle while I got off; and then I walked out straight ahead till I butted against
the mesquite where my roan was tied.
&ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s gone riding,&rsquo; I whisper in my bronc&rsquo;s ear, &lsquo;with Birdstone Jack, the hired mule
from Sheep Man&rsquo;s Canada. Did you get that, old Leather-and-Gallops?&rsquo;
&ldquo;That bronc of mine wept, in his way. He&rsquo;d been raised a cow pony and he didn&rsquo;t care
for snoozers.
&ldquo;I went back and said to Uncle Emsley: &lsquo;Did you say a sheep man?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I said a sheep man,&rsquo; says Uncle Emsley again. &lsquo;You must have heard tell of Jackson Bird.
He&rsquo;s got eight sections of grazing and four thousand head of the finest Merinos south of the
Arctic Circle.&rsquo;
&ldquo;I went out and sat on the ground in the shade of the store and leaned against a prickly
pear. I sifted sand into my boots with unthinking hands while I soliloquised a quantity about
this bird with the Jackson plumage to his name.
&ldquo;I never had believed in harming sheep men. I see one, one day, reading a Latin
grammar on hossback, and I never touched him! They never irritated me like they do most
cowmen. You wouldn&rsquo;t go to work now, and impair and disfigure snoozers, would you, that
eat on tables and wear little shoes and speak to you on subjects? I had always let &lsquo;em pass,
just as you would a jack-rabbit; with a polite word and a guess about the weather, but no
stopping to swap canteens. I never thought it was worth while to be hostile with a snoozer.
And because I&rsquo;d been lenient, and let &lsquo;em live, here was one going around riding with Miss
Willella Learight!&ldquo;An hour by sun they come loping back, and stopped at Uncle Emsley&rsquo;s gate. The sheep
person helped her off; and they stood throwing each other sentences all sprightful and
sagacious for a while. And then this feathered Jackson flies up in his saddle and raises his
little stewpot of a hat, and trots off in the direction of his mutton ranch. By this time I had
turned the sand out of my boots and unpinned myself from the prickly pear; and by the time
he gets half a mile out of Pimienta, I singlefoots up beside him on my bronc.
&ldquo;I said that snoozer was pink-eyed, but he wasn&rsquo;t. His seeing arrangement was grey
enough, but his eye-lashes was pink and his hair was sandy, and that gave you the idea.
Sheep man?&ndash;he wasn&rsquo;t more than a lamb man, anyhow&ndash;a little thing with his neck involved
in a yellow silk handkerchief, and shoes tied up in bowknots.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Afternoon!&rsquo; says I to him. &lsquo;You now ride with a equestrian who is commonly called
Dead-Moral-Certainty Judson, on account of the way I shoot. When I want a stranger to
know me I always introduce myself before the draw, for I never did like to shake hands with
ghosts.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; says he, just like that&ndash;&lsquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m glad to know you, Mr. Judson. I&rsquo;m Jackson Bird,
from over at Mired Mule Ranch.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Just then one of my eyes saw a roadrunner skipping down the hill with a young
tarantula in his bill, and the other eye noticed a rabbit-hawk sitting on a dead limb in a
water-elm. I popped over one after the other with my forty-five, just to show him. &lsquo;Two out
of three,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Birds just naturally seem to draw my fire wherever I go.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Nice shooting,&rsquo; says the sheep man, without a flutter. &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t you sometimes ever
miss the third shot? Elegant fine rain that was last week for the young grass, Mr. Judson?&rsquo;
says he.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Willie,&rsquo; says I, riding over close to his palfrey, &lsquo;your infatuated parents may have
denounced you by the name of Jackson, but you sure moulted into a twittering Willie&ndash;let us
slough off this here analysis of rain and the elements, and get down to talk that is outside
the vocabulary of parrots. That is a bad habit you have got of riding with young ladies over at
Pimienta. I&rsquo;ve known birds,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;to be served on toast for less than that. Miss Willella,&rsquo;
says I, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t ever want any nest made out of sheep&rsquo;s wool by a tomtit of the Jacksonian
branch of ornithology. Now, are you going to quit, or do you wish for to gallop up against this
Dead-Moral-Certainty attachment to my name, which is good for two hyphens and at least
one set of funeral obsequies?&rsquo;
&ldquo;Jackson Bird flushed up some, and then he laughed.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, Mr. Judson,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve got the wrong idea. I&rsquo;ve called on Miss Learight a
few times; but not for the purpose you imagine. My object is purely a gastronomical one.&lsquo;&ldquo;I reached for my gun.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Any coyote,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;that would boast of dishonourable&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; says this Bird, &lsquo;till I explain. What would I do with a wife? If you ever
saw that ranch of mine! I do my own cooking and mending. Eating&ndash;that&rsquo;s all the pleasure I
get out of sheep raising. Mr. Judson, did you ever taste the pancakes that Miss Learight
makes?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Me? No,&rsquo; I told him. &lsquo;I never was advised that she was up to any culinary manoeuvres.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;re golden sunshine,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;honey-browned by the ambrosial fires of Epicurus.
I&rsquo;d give two years of my life to get the recipe for making them pancakes. That&rsquo;s what I went
to see Miss Learight for,&rsquo; says Jackson Bird, &lsquo;but I haven&rsquo;t been able to get it from her. It&rsquo;s an
old recipe that&rsquo;s been in the family for seventy-five years. They hand it down from one
generation to another, but they don&rsquo;t give it away to outsiders. If I could get that recipe, so I
could make them pancakes for myself on my ranch, I&rsquo;d be a happy man,&rsquo; says Bird.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you sure,&rsquo; I says to him, &lsquo;that it ain&rsquo;t the hand that mixes the pancakes that you&rsquo;re
after?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Sure,&rsquo; says Jackson. &lsquo;Miss Learight is a mighty nice girl, but I can assure you my
intentions go no further than the gastro&ndash;&rsquo; but he seen my hand going down to my holster
and he changed his similitude&ndash;&lsquo;than the desire to procure a copy of the pancake recipe,&rsquo; he
finishes.
&ldquo;&lsquo;You ain&rsquo;t such a bad little man,&rsquo; says I, trying to be fair. &lsquo;I was thinking some of making
orphans of your sheep, but I&rsquo;ll let you fly away this time. But you stick to pancakes,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;as
close as the middle one of a stack; and don&rsquo;t go and mistake sentiments for syrup, or there&rsquo;ll
be singing at your ranch, and you won&rsquo;t hear it.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;To convince you that I am sincere,&rsquo; says the sheep man, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you to help me. Miss
Learight and you being closer friends, maybe she would do for you what she wouldn&rsquo;t for me.
If you will get me a copy of that pancake recipe, I give you my word that I&rsquo;ll never call upon
her again.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s fair,&rsquo; I says, and I shook hands with Jackson Bird. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get it for you if I can, and
glad to oblige.&rsquo; And he turned off down the big pear flat on the Piedra, in the direction of
Mired Mule; and I steered northwest for old Bill Toomey&rsquo;s ranch.
&ldquo;It was five days afterward when I got another chance to ride over to Pimienta. Miss
Willella and me passed a gratifying evening at Uncle Emsley&rsquo;s. She sang some, and
exasperated the piano quite a lot with quotations from the operas. I gave imitations of a
rattlesnake, and told her about Snaky McFee&rsquo;s new way of skinning cows, and described thetrip I made to Saint Louis once. We was getting along in one another&rsquo;s estimations fine.
Thinks I, if Jackson Bird can now be persuaded to migrate, I win. I recollect his promise about
the pancake receipt, and I thinks I will persuade it from Miss Willella and give it to him; and
then if I catches Birdie off of Mired Mule again, I&rsquo;ll make him hop the twig.
&ldquo;So, along about ten o&rsquo;clock, I put on a wheedling smile and says to Miss Willella: &lsquo;Now,
if there&rsquo;s anything I do like better than the sight of a red steer on green grass it&rsquo;s the taste of
a nice hot pancake smothered in sugar-house molasses.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Miss Willella gives a little jump on the piano stool, and looked at me curious.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;they&rsquo;re real nice. What did you say was the name of that street in Saint
Louis, Mr. Odom, where you lost your hat?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Pancake Avenue,&rsquo; says I, with a wink, to show her that I was on about the family
receipt, and couldn&rsquo;t be side-corralled off of the subject. &lsquo;Come, now, Miss Willella,&rsquo; I says;
&lsquo;let&rsquo;s hear how you make &lsquo;em. Pancakes is just whirling in my head like wagon wheels. Start
her off, now&ndash;pound of flour, eight dozen eggs, and so on. How does the catalogue of
constituents run?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Excuse me for a moment, please,&rsquo; says Miss Willella, and she gives me a quick kind of
sideways look, and slides off the stool. She ambled out into the other room, and directly
Uncle Emsley comes in in his shirt sleeves, with a pitcher of water. He turns around to get a
glass on the table, and I see a forty-five in his hip pocket. &lsquo;Great post- holes!&rsquo; thinks I, &lsquo;but
here&rsquo;s a family thinks a heap of cooking receipts, protecting it with firearms. I&rsquo;ve known
outfits that wouldn&rsquo;t do that much by a family feud.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Drink this here down,&rsquo; says Uncle Emsley, handing me the glass of water. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve rid
too far to-day, Jud, and got yourself over-excited. Try to think about something else now.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know how to make them pancakes, Uncle Emsley?&rsquo; I asked.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not as apprised in the anatomy of them as some,&rsquo; says Uncle Emsley, &lsquo;but I
reckon you take a sifter of plaster of Paris and a little dough and saleratus and corn meal,
and mix &lsquo;em with eggs and buttermilk as usual. Is old Bill going to ship beeves to Kansas City
again this spring, Jud?&rsquo;
&ldquo;That was all the pancake specifications I could get that night. I didn&rsquo;t wonder that
Jackson Bird found it uphill work. So I dropped the subject and talked with Uncle Emsley for
a while about hollow-horn and cyclones. And then Miss Willella came and said &lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo;
and I hit the breeze for the ranch.
&ldquo;About a week afterward I met Jackson Bird riding out of Pimienta as I rode in, and we
stopped on the road for a few frivolous remarks.&ldquo;&lsquo;Got the bill of particulars for them flapjacks yet?&rsquo; I asked him.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, no,&rsquo; says Jackson. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to have any success in getting hold of it. Did you
try?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I did,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and &lsquo;twas like trying to dig a prairie dog out of his hole with a peanut hull.
That pancake receipt must be a jookalorum, the way they hold on to it.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m most ready to give it up,&rsquo; says Jackson, so discouraged in his pronunciations that I
felt sorry for him; &lsquo;but I did want to know how to make them pancakes to eat on my lonely
ranch,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I lie awake at nights thinking how good they are.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;You keep on trying for it,&rsquo; I tells him, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll do the same. One of us is bound to get a
rope over its horns before long. Well, so- long, Jacksy.&rsquo;
&ldquo;You see, by this time we were on the peacefullest of terms. When I saw that he wasn&rsquo;t
after Miss Willella, I had more endurable contemplations of that sandy-haired snoozer. In
order to help out the ambitions of his appetite I kept on trying to get that receipt from Miss
Willella. But every time I would say &lsquo;pancakes&rsquo; she would get sort of remote and fidgety
about the eye, and try to change the subject. If I held her to it she would slide out and round
up Uncle Emsley with his pitcher of water and hip-pocket howitzer.
&ldquo;One day I galloped over to the store with a fine bunch of blue verbenas that I cut out
of a herd of wild flowers over on Poisoned Dog Prairie. Uncle Emsley looked at &lsquo;em with one
eye shut and says:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t ye heard the news?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Cattle up?&rsquo; I asks.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Willella and Jackson Bird was married in Palestine yesterday,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Just got a letter
this morning.&rsquo;
&ldquo;I dropped them flowers in a cracker-barrel, and let the news trickle in my ears and
down toward my upper left-hand shirt pocket until it got to my feet.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Would you mind saying that over again once more, Uncle Emsley?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Maybe my
hearing has got wrong, and you only said that prime heifers was 4.80 on the hoof, or
something like that.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Married yesterday,&rsquo; says Uncle Emsley, &lsquo;and gone to Waco and Niagara Falls on a
wedding tour. Why, didn&rsquo;t you see none of the signs all along? Jackson Bird has been
courting Willella ever since that day he took her out riding.&lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; says I, in a kind of yell, &lsquo;what was all this zizzaparoola he gives me about
pancakes? Tell me that.&rsquo;
&ldquo;When I said &lsquo;pancakes&rsquo; Uncle Emsley sort of dodged and stepped back.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Somebody&rsquo;s been dealing me pancakes from the bottom of the deck,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll
find out. I believe you know. Talk up,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;or we&rsquo;ll mix a panful of batter right here.&rsquo;
&ldquo;I slid over the counter after Uncle Emsley. He grabbed at his gun, but it was in a drawer,
and he missed it two inches. I got him by the front of his shirt and shoved him in a corner.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Talk pancakes,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;or be made into one. Does Miss Willella make &lsquo;em?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;She never made one in her life and I never saw one,&rsquo; says Uncle Emsley, soothing.
&lsquo;Calm down now, Jud&ndash;calm down. You&rsquo;ve got excited, and that wound in your head is
contaminating your sense of intelligence. Try not to think about pancakes.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Uncle Emsley,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not wounded in the head except so far as my natural
cognitive instincts run to runts. Jackson Bird told me he was calling on Miss Willella for the
purpose of finding out her system of producing pancakes, and he asked me to help him get
the bill of lading of the ingredients. I done so, with the results as you see. Have I been
sodded down with Johnson grass by a pink-eyed snoozer, or what?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Slack up your grip in my dress shirt,&rsquo; says Uncle Emsley, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you. Yes, it looks
like Jackson Bird has gone and humbugged you some. The day after he went riding with
Willella he came back and told me and her to watch out for you whenever you got to talking
about pancakes. He said you was in camp once where they was cooking flapjacks, and one of
the fellows cut you over the head with a frying pan. Jackson said that whenever you got
overhot or excited that wound hurt you and made you kind of crazy, and you went raving
about pancakes. He told us to just get you worked off of the subject and soothed down, and
you wouldn&rsquo;t be dangerous. So, me and Willella done the best by you we knew how. Well,
well,&rsquo; says Uncle Emsley, &lsquo;that Jackson Bird is sure a seldom kind of a snoozer.&rsquo;&rdquo;
During the progress of Jud&rsquo;s story he had been slowly but deftly combining certain
portions of the contents of his sacks and cans. Toward the close of it he set before me the
finished product&ndash;a pair of red-hot, rich-hued pancakes on a tin plate. From some secret
hoarding he also brought a lump of excellent butter and a bottle of golden syrup.
&ldquo;How long ago did these things happen?&rdquo; I asked him.
&ldquo;Three years,&rdquo; said Jud. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re living on the Mired Mule Ranch now. But I haven&rsquo;t
seen either of &lsquo;em since. They say Jackson Bird was fixing his ranch up fine with rockingchairs and window curtains all the time he was putting me up the pancake tree. Oh, I got
over it after a while. But the boys kept the racket up.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Did you make these cakes by the famous recipe?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you there wasn&rsquo;t no receipt?&rdquo; said Jud. &ldquo;The boys hollered pancakes till
they got pancake hungry, and I cut this recipe out of a newspaper. How does the truck
taste?&rdquo;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re delicious,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have some, too, Jud?&rdquo;
I was sure I heard a sigh.
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Jud. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ever eat &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
The Poet And The Peasant （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The other day a poet friend of mine, who has lived in close communion with nature all
his life, wrote a poem and took it to an editor.
It was a living pastoral, full of the genuine breath of the fields, the song of birds, and
the pleasant chatter of trickling streams.
When the poet called again to see about it, with hopes of a beefsteak dinner in his
heart, it was handed back to him with the comment:
&ldquo;Too artificial.&rdquo;
Several of us met over spaghetti and Dutchess County chianti, and swallowed
indignation with slippery forkfuls.
And there we dug a pit for the editor. With us was Conant, a well-arrived writer of
fiction - a man who had trod on asphalt all his life, and who had never looked upon bucolic
scenes except with sensations of disgust from the windows of express trains.
Conant wrote a poem and called it &ldquo;The Doe and the Brook.&rdquo; It was a fine specimen of
the kind of work you would expect from a poet who had strayed with Amaryllis only as far as
the florist&rsquo;s windows, and whose sole ornithological discussion had been carried on with a
waiter. Conant signed this poem, and we sent it to the same editor.But this has very little to do with the story.
Just as the editor was reading the first line of the poem, on the next morning, a being
stumbled off the West Shore ferryboat, and loped slowly up Forty-second Street.
The invader was a young man with light blue eyes, a hanging lip and hair the exact color
of the little orphan&rsquo;s (afterward discovered to be the earl&rsquo;s daughter) in one of Mr. Blaney&rsquo;s
plays. His trousers were corduroy, his coat short-sleeved, with buttons in the middle of his
back. One bootleg was outside the corduroys. You looked expectantly, though in vain, at his
straw hat for ear holes, its shape inaugurating the suspicion that it had been ravaged from a
former equine possessor. In his hand was a valise - description of it is an impossible task; a
Boston man would not have carried his lunch and law books to his office in it. And above
one ear, in his hair, was a wisp of hay - the rustic&rsquo;s letter of credit, his badge of innocence,
the last clinging touch of the Garden of Eden lingering to shame the gold-brick men.
Knowingly, smilingly, the city crowds passed him by. They saw the raw stranger stand in
the gutter and stretch his neck at the tall buildings. At this they ceased to smile, and even to
look at him. It had been done so often. A few glanced at the antique valise to see what
Coney &ldquo;attraction&rdquo; or brand of chewing gum he might be thus dinning into his memory. But
for the most part he was ignored. Even the newsboys looked bored when he scampered like
a circus clown out of the way of cabs and street cars.
At Eighth Avenue stood &ldquo;Bunco Harry,&rdquo; with his dyed mustache and shiny, good-natured
eyes. Harry was too good an artist not to be pained at the sight of an actor overdoing his
part. He edged up to the countryman, who had stopped to open his mouth at a jewelry store
window, and shook his head.
&ldquo;Too thick, pal,&rdquo; he said, critically - &ldquo;too thick by a couple of inches. I don&rsquo;t know what
your lay is; but you&rsquo;ve got the properties too thick. That hay, now - why, they don&rsquo;t even
allow that on Proctor&rsquo;s circuit any more.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, mister,&rdquo; said the green one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lookin&rsquo; for any circus. I&rsquo;ve
just run down from Ulster County to look at the town, bein&rsquo; that the hayin&rsquo;s over with. Gosh!
but it&rsquo;s a whopper. I thought Poughkeepsie was some punkins; but this here town is five
times as big.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Bunco Harry,&rdquo; raising his eyebrows, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to butt in. You don&rsquo;t
have to tell. I thought you ought to tone down a little, so I tried to put you wise. Wish you
success at your graft, whatever it is. Come and have a drink, anyhow.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having a glass of lager beer,&rdquo; acknowledged the other.They went to a cafe frequented by men with smooth faces and shifty eyes, and sat at
their drinks.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I come across you, mister,&rdquo; said Haylocks. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you like to play a game or
two of seven-up? I&rsquo;ve got the keerds.&rdquo;
He fished them out of Noah&rsquo;s valise - a rare, inimitable deck, greasy with bacon suppers
and grimy with the soil of cornfields.
&ldquo;Bunco Harry&rdquo; laughed loud and briefly.
&ldquo;Not for me, sport,&rdquo; he said, firmly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go against that make-up of yours for a cent.
But I still say you&rsquo;ve overdone it. The Reubs haven&rsquo;t dressed like that since &lsquo;79. I doubt if you
could work Brooklyn for a key-winding watch with that layout.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t think I ain&rsquo;t got the money,&rdquo; boasted Haylocks. He drew forth a tightly
rolled mass of bills as large as a teacup, and laid it on the table.
&ldquo;Got that for my share of grandmother&rsquo;s farm,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s $950 in that
roll. Thought I&rsquo;d come to the city and look around for a likely business to go into.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bunco Harry&rdquo; took up the roll of money and looked at it with almost respect in his
smiling eyes.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen worse,&rdquo; he said, critically. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll never do it in them clothes. You want to
get light tan shoes and a black suit and a straw hat with a colored band, and talk a good deal
about Pittsburg and freight differentials, and drink sherry for breakfast in order to work off
phony stuff like that.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his line?&rdquo; asked two or three shifty-eyed men of &ldquo;Bunco Harry&rdquo; after Haylocks
had gathered up his impugned money and departed.
&ldquo;The queer, I guess,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Or else he&rsquo;s one of Jerome&rsquo;s men. Or some guy with a
new graft. He&rsquo;s too much hayseed. Maybe that his - I wonder now - oh, no, it couldn&rsquo;t have
been real money.&rdquo;
Haylocks wandered on. Thirst probably assailed him again, for he dived into a dark
groggery on a side street and bought beer. At first sight of him their eyes brightened; but
when his insistent and exaggerated rusticity became apparent their expressions changed to
wary suspicion.
Haylocks swung his valise across the bar.&ldquo;Keep that a while for me, mister,&rdquo; he said, chewing at the end of a virulent claybank
cigar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back after I knock around a spell. And keep your eye on it, for there&rsquo;s $950
inside of it, though maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t think so to look at me.&rdquo;
Somewhere outside a phonograph struck up a band piece, and Haylocks was off for it,
his coat-tail buttons flopping in the middle of his back.
&ldquo;Divvy, Mike,&rdquo; said the men hanging upon the bar, winking openly at one another.
&ldquo;Honest, now,&rdquo; said the bartender, kicking the valise to one side. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d fall
to that, do you? Anybody can see he ain&rsquo;t no jay. One of McAdoo&rsquo;s come-on squad, I guess.
He&rsquo;s a shine if he made himself up. There ain&rsquo;t no parts of the country now where they dress
like that since they run rural free delivery to Providence, Rhode Island. If he&rsquo;s got nine-fifty
in that valise it&rsquo;s a ninety-eight cent Waterbury that&rsquo;s stopped at ten minutes to ten.&rdquo;
When Haylocks had exhausted the resources of Mr. Edison to amuse he returned for his
valise. And then down Broadway he gallivanted, culling the sights with his eager blue eyes.
But still and evermore Broadway rejected him with curt glances and sardonic smiles. He was
the oldest of the &ldquo;gags&rdquo; that the city must endure. He was so flagrantly impossible, so ultra
rustic, so exaggerated beyond the most freakish products of the barnyard, the hayfield and
the vaudeville stage, that he excited only weariness and suspicion. And the wisp of hay in his
hair was so genuine, so fresh and redolent of the meadows, so clamorously rural that even a
shellgame man would have put up his peas and folded his table at the sight of it.
Haylocks seated himself upon a flight of stone steps and once more exhumed his roll of
yellow-backs from the valise. The outer one, a twenty, he shucked off and beckoned to a
newsboy.
&ldquo;Son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;run somewhere and get this changed for me. I&rsquo;m mighty nigh out of
chicken feed. I guess you&rsquo;ll get a nickel if you&rsquo;ll hurry up.&rdquo;
A hurt look appeared through the dirt on the newsy&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Aw, watchert&rsquo;ink! G&rsquo;wan and get yer funny bill changed yerself. Dey ain&rsquo;t no farm
clothes yer got on. G&rsquo;wan wit yer stage money.&rdquo;
On a corner lounged a keen-eyed steerer for a gambling-house. He was Haylocks, and
his expression suddenly grew cold and virtuous.
&ldquo;Mister,&rdquo; said the rural one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of places in this here town where a fellow could
have a good game of old sledge or peg a card at keno. I got $950 in this valise, and I come
down from old Ulster to see the sights. Know where a fellow could get action on about $9 or
$10? I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to have some sport, and then maybe I&rsquo;ll buy out a business of some kind.&ldquo;The steerer looked pained, and investigated a white speck on his left forefinger nail.
&ldquo;Cheese it, old man,&rdquo; he murmured, reproachfully. &ldquo;The Central Office must be
bughouse to send you out looking like such a gillie. You couldn&rsquo;t get within two blocks of a
sidewalk crap game in them Tony Pastor props. The recent Mr. Scotty from Death Valley has
got you beat a crosstown block in the way of Elizabethan scenery and mechanical
accessories. Let it be skiddoo for yours. Nay, I know of no gilded halls where one may bet a
patrol wagon on the ace.&rdquo;
Rebuffed once again by the great city that is so swift to detect artificialities, Haylocks
sat upon the curb and presented his thoughts to hold a conference.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my clothes,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;durned if it ain&rsquo;t. They think I&rsquo;m a hayseed and won&rsquo;t have
nothin&rsquo; to do with me. Nobody never made fun of this hat in Ulster County. I guess if you
want folks to notice you in New York you must dress up like they do.&rdquo;
So Haylocks went shopping in the bazaars where men spake through their noses and
rubbed their hands and ran the tape line ecstatically over the buldge in his inside pocket
where reposed a red nubbin of corn with an even number of rows. And messengers bearing
parcels and boxes streamed to his hotel on Broadway within the lights of Long Acre.
At 9 o&rsquo;clock in the evening one descended to the sidewalk whom Ulster County would
have foresworn. Bright tan were his shoes; his hat the latest block. His light gray trousers
were deeply creased; a gay blue silk handkerchief flapped from the breast pocket of his
elegant English walking coat. His collar might have graced a laundry window; his blond hair
was trimmed close; the wisp of hay was gone.
For an instant he stood, resplendent, with the leisurely air of a boulevardier concocting
in his mind the route for his evening pleasures. And then he turned down the gay, bright
street with the easy and graceful tread of a millionaire.
But in the instant that he had paused the wisest and keenest eyes in the city had
enveloped him in their field of vision. A stout man with gray eyes picked two of his friends
with a lift of his eyebrows from the row of loungers in front of the hotel.
&ldquo;The juiciest jay I&rsquo;ve seen in six months,&rdquo; said the man with gray eyes. &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;
It was half-past eleven when a man galloped into the West Forty-seventh Street Police
Station with the story of his wrongs.
&ldquo;Nine hundred and fifty dollars,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;all my share of grandmother&rsquo;s farm.&rdquo;
The desk seargeant wrung from him the name Jabez Bulltongue, of Locust Valley farm,
Ulster County, and then bagan to take descriptions of the strong-arm gentlemen.When Conant went to see the editor about the fate of his poem, he was received over
the head of the office boy into the inner office that is decorated with the statuettes by Rodin
and J. G. Brown.
&ldquo;When I read the first line of &lsquo;The Doe and the Brook,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the editor, &ldquo;I knew it to be
the work of one whose life has been heart to heart with Nature. The finished art of the line
did not blind me to that fact. To use a somewhat homely comparison, it was as if a wild, free
child of the woods and fields were to don the garb of fashion and walk down Broadway.
Beneath the apparel the man would show.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Conant. &ldquo;I suppose the check will be round on Thursday, as usual.&rdquo;
The morals of this story have somehow gotten mixed. You can take your choice of &ldquo;Stay
on the Farm&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Write Poetry.&rdquo;
A Poor Rule （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>I have always maintained, and asserted ime to time, that woman is no mystery; that
man can foretell, construe, subdue, comprehend, and interpret her. That she is a mystery
has been foisted by herself upon credulous mankind. Whether I am right or wrong we shall
see. As &ldquo;Harper&rsquo;s Drawer&rdquo; used to say in bygone years: &ldquo;The following good story is told of
Miss &ndash;, Mr. &ndash;, Mr. &ndash;and Mr. &ndash;.&rdquo;
We shall have to omit &ldquo;Bishop X&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Rev. &ndash;,&rdquo; for they do not belong.
In those days Paloma was a new town on the line of the Southern Pacific. A reporter
would have called it a &ldquo;mushroom&rdquo; town; but it was not. Paloma was, first and last, of the
toadstool variety.
The train stopped there at noon for the engine to drink and for the passengers both to
drink and to dine. There was a new yellow-pine hotel, also a wool warehouse, and perhaps
three dozen box residences. The rest was composed of tents, cow ponies, &ldquo;black-waxy&rdquo; mud,
and mesquite-trees, all bound round by a horizon. Paloma was an about-to- be city. The
houses represented faith; the tents hope; the twice-a- day train by which you might leave,
creditably sustained the role of charity.
The Parisian Restaurant occupied the muddiest spot in the town while it rained, and the
warmest when it shone. It was operated, owned, and perpetrated by a citizen known as OldMan Hinkle, who had come out of Indiana to make his fortune in this land of condensed milk
and sorghum.
There was a four-room, unpainted, weather-boarded box house in which the family
lived. From the kitchen extended a &ldquo;shelter&rdquo; made of poles covered with chaparral brush.
Under this was a table and two benches, each twenty feet long, the product of Paloma home
carpentry. Here was set forth the roast mutton, the stewed apples, boiled beans, sodabiscuits, puddinorpie, and hot coffee of the Parisian menu.
Ma Hinkle and a subordinate known to the ears as &ldquo;Betty,&rdquo; but denied to the eyesight,
presided at the range. Pa Hinkle himself, with salamandrous thumbs, served the scalding
viands. During rush hours a Mexican youth, who rolled and smoked cigarettes between
courses, aided him in waiting on the guests. As is customary at Parisian banquets, I place the
sweets at the end of my wordy menu.
Ileen Hinkle!
The spelling is correct, for I have seen her write it. No doubt she had been named by
ear; but she so splendidly bore the orthography that Tom Moore himself (had he seen her)
would have indorsed the phonography.
Ileen was the daughter of the house, and the first Lady Cashier to invade the territory
south of an east-and-west line drawn through Galveston and Del Rio. She sat on a high stool
in a rough pine grand- stand&ndash;or was it a temple?&ndash;under the shelter at the door of the
kitchen. There was a barbed-wire protection in front of her, with a little arch under which
you passed your money. Heaven knows why the barbed wire; for every man who dined
Parisianly there would have died in her service. Her duties were light; each meal was a dollar;
you put it under the arch, and she took it.
I set out with the intent to describe Ileen Hinkle to you. Instead, I must refer you to the
volume by Edmund Burke entitled: A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the
Sublime and Beautiful. It is an exhaustive treatise, dealing first with the primitive
conceptions of beauty&ndash;roundness and smoothness, I think they are, according to Burke. It is
well said. Rotundity is a patent charm; as for smoothness&ndash;the more new wrinkles a woman
acquires, the smoother she becomes.
Ileen was a strictly vegetable compound, guaranteed under the Pure Ambrosia and
Balm-of-Gilead Act of the year of the fall of Adam. She was a fruit-stand blonde-strawberries,
peaches, cherries, etc. Her eyes were wide apart, and she possessed the calm that precedes
a storm that never comes. But it seems to me that words (at any rate per) are wasted in an
effort to describe the beautiful. Like fancy, &ldquo;It is engendered in the eyes.&rdquo; There are three
kinds of beauties&ndash;I was foreordained to be homiletic; I can never stick to a story.The first is the freckle-faced, snub-nosed girl whom you like. The second is Maud
Adams. The third is, or are, the ladies in Bouguereau&rsquo;s paintings. Ileen Hinkle was the fourth.
She was the mayoress of Spotless Town. There were a thousand golden apples coming to her
as Helen of the Troy laundries.
The Parisian Restaurant was within a radius. Even from beyond its circumference men
rode in to Paloma to win her smiles. They got them. One meal&ndash;one smile&ndash;one dollar. But,
with all her impartiality, Ileen seemed to favor three of her admirers above the rest.
According to the rules of politeness, I will mention myself last.
The first was an artificial product known as Bryan Jacks&ndash;a name that had obviously met
with reverses. Jacks was the outcome of paved cities. He was a small man made of some
material resembling flexible sandstone. His hair was the color of a brick Quaker
meeting-house; his eyes were twin cranberries; his mouth was like the aperture under a
drop-letters-here sign.
He knew every city from Bangor to San Francisco, thence north to Portland, thence S.
45 E. to a given point in Florida. He had mastered every art, trade, game, business,
profession, and sport in the world, had been present at, or hurrying on his way to, every
head- line event that had ever occurred between oceans since he was five years old. You
might open the atlas, place your finger at random upon the name of a town, and Jacks
would tell you the front names of three prominent citizens before you could close it again.
He spoke patronizingly and even disrespectfully of Broadway, Beacon Hill, Michigan, Euclid,
and Fifth avenues, and the St. Louis Four Courts. Compared with him as a cosmopolite, the
Wandering Jew would have seemed a mere hermit. He had learned everything the world
could teach him, and he would tell you about it.
I hate to be reminded of Pollock&rsquo;s Course of Time, and so do you; but every time I saw
Jacks I would think of the poet&rsquo;s description of another poet by the name of G. G. Byron who
&ldquo;Drank early; deeply drank&ndash;drank draughts that common millions might have quenched;
then died of thirst because there was no more to drink.&rdquo;
That fitted Jacks, except that, instead of dying, he came to Paloma, which was about
the same thing. He was a telegrapher and station- and express-agent at seventy-five dollars
a month. Why a young man who knew everything and could do everything was content to
serve in such an obscure capacity I never could understand, although he let out a hint once
that it was as a personal favor to the president and stockholders of the S. P. Ry. Co.
One more line of description, and I turn Jacks over to you. He wore bright blue clothes,
yellow shoes, and a bow tie made of the same cloth as his shirt.
My rival No.2 was Bud Cunningham, whose services had been engaged by a ranch near
Paloma to assist in compelling refractory cattle to keep within the bounds of decorum andorder. Bud was the only cowboy off the stage that I ever saw who looked like one on it. He
wore the sombrero, the chaps, and the handkerchief tied at the back of his neck.
Twice a week Bud rode in from the Val Verde Ranch to sup at the Parisian Restaurant.
He rode a many-high-handed Kentucky horse at a tremendously fast lope, which animal he
would rein up so suddenly under the big mesquite at the corner of the brush shelter that his
hoofs would plough canals yards long in the loam.
Jacks and I were regular boarders at the restaurant, of course.
The front room of the Hinkle House was as neat a little parlor as there was in the
black-waxy country. It was all willow rocking- chairs, and home-knit tidies, and albums, and
conch shells in a row. And a little upright piano in one comer.
Here Jacks and Bud and I&ndash;or sometimes one or two of us, according to our
good-luck&ndash;used to sit of evenings when the tide of trade was over, and &ldquo;visit&rdquo; Miss Hinkle.
Ileen was a girl of ideas. She was destined for higher things (if there can be anything
higher) than taking in dollars all day through a barbed-wire wicket. She had read and
listened and thought. Her looks would have formed a career for a less ambitious girl; but,
rising superior to mere beauty, she must establish something in the nature of a salon&ndash;the
only one in Paloma.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that Shakespeare was a great writer?&rdquo; she would ask, with such a
pretty little knit of her arched brows that the late Ignatius Donnelly, himself, had he seen it,
could scarcely have saved his Bacon.
Ileen was of the opinion, also, that Boston is more cultured than Chicago; that Rosa
Bonheur was one of the greatest of women painters; that Westerners are more spontaneous
and open-hearted than Easterners; that London must be a very foggy city, and that California
must be quite lovely in the springtime. And of many other opinions indicating a keeping up
with the world&rsquo;s best thought.
These, however, were but gleaned from hearsay and evidence: Ileen had theories of her
own. One, in particular, she disseminated to us untiringly. Flattery she detested. Frankness
and honesty of speech and action, she declared, were the chief mental ornaments of man
and woman. If ever she could like any one, it would be for those qualities.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully weary,&rdquo; she said, one evening, when we three musketeers of the mesquite
were in the little parlor, &ldquo;of having compliments on my looks paid to me. I know I&rsquo;m not
beautiful.&rdquo;
(Bud Cunningham told me afterward that it was all he could do to keep from calling her
a liar when she said that.)&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a little Middle-Western girl,&rdquo; went on Ileen, &ldquo;who justs wants to be simple and
neat, and tries to help her father make a humble living.&rdquo;
(Old Man Hinkle was shipping a thousand silver dollars a month, clear profit, to a bank
in San Antonio.[)]
Bud twisted around in his chair and bent the rim of his hat, from which he could never
be persuaded to separate. He did not know whether she wanted what she said she wanted
or what she knew she deserved. Many a wiser man has hesitated at deciding. Bud decided.
&ldquo;Why&ndash;ah, Miss Ileen, beauty, as you might say, ain&rsquo;t everything. Not sayin&rsquo; that you
haven&rsquo;t your share of good looks, I always admired more than anything else about you the
nice, kind way you treat your ma and pa. Any one what&rsquo;s good to their parents and is a kind
of home- body don&rsquo;t specially need to be too pretty.&rdquo;
Ileen gave him one of her sweetest smiles. &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Cunningham,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
consider that one of the finest compliments I&rsquo;ve had in a long time. I&rsquo;d so much rather hear
you say that than to hear you talk about my eyes and hair. I&rsquo;m glad you believe me when I
say I don&rsquo;t like flattery.&rdquo;
Our cue was there for us. Bud had made a good guess. You couldn&rsquo;t lose Jacks. He
chimed in next.
&ldquo;Sure thing, Miss Ileen,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the good-lookers don&rsquo;t always win out. Now, you ain&rsquo;t
bad looking, of course-but that&rsquo;s nix-cum-rous. I knew a girl once in Dubuque with a face like
a cocoanut, who could skin the cat twice on a horizontal bar without changing hands. Now, a
girl might have the California peach crop mashed to a marmalade and not be able to do that.
I&rsquo;ve seen&ndash;er&ndash;worse lookers than you, Miss Ileen; but what I like about you is the business
way you&rsquo;ve got of doing things. Cool and wise&ndash;that&rsquo;s the winning way for a girl. Mr. Hinkle
told me the other day you&rsquo;d never taken in a lead silver dollar or a plugged one since you&rsquo;ve
been on the job. Now, that&rsquo;s the stuff for a girl&ndash;that&rsquo;s what catches me.&rdquo;
Jacks got his smile, too.
&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Jacks,&rdquo; said Ileen. &ldquo;If you only knew how I appreciate any one&rsquo;s being
candid and not a flatterer! I get so tired of people telling me I&rsquo;m pretty. I think it is the
loveliest thing to have friends who tell you the truth.&rdquo;
Then I thought I saw an expectant look on Ileen&rsquo;s face as she glanced toward me. I had
a wild, sudden impulse to dare fate, and tell her of all the beautiful handiwork of the Great
Artificer she was the most exquisite&ndash;that she was a flawless pearl gleaming pure and serene
in a setting of black mud and emerald prairies&ndash;that she was&ndash;a&ndash;a corker; and as for mine, I
cared not if she were as crtiel as a serpent&rsquo;s tooth to her fond parents, or if she couldn&rsquo;t tella plugged dollar from a bridle buckle, if I might sing, chant, praise, glorify, and worship her
peerless and wonderful beauty.
But I refrained. I feared the fate of a flatterer. I had witnessed her delight at the crafty
and discreet words of Bud and Jacks. No! Miss Hinkle was not one to be beguiled by the
plated-silver tongue of a flatterer. So I joined the ranks of the candid and honest. At once I
became mendacious and didactic.
&ldquo;In all ages, Miss Hinkle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in spite of the poetry and romance of each, intellect in
woman has been admired more than beauty. Even in Cleopatra, herself, men found more
charm in her queenly mind than in her looks.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, I should think so!&rdquo; said Ileen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen pictures of her that weren&rsquo;t so much. she
had an awfully long nose.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If I may say so,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;you remind me of Cleopatra, Miss Ileen.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, my nose isn&rsquo;t so long!&rdquo; said she, opening her eyes wide and touching that comely
feature with a dimpled forefinger.
&ldquo;Why&ndash;er&ndash;I mean,&rdquo; said I&ndash;&rdquo; I mean as to mental endowments.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she; and then I got my smile just as Bud and Jacks had got theirs.
&ldquo;Thank every one of you,&rdquo; she said, very, very sweetly, &ldquo;for being so frank and honest
with me. That&rsquo;s the way I want you to be always. Just tell me plainly and truthfully what you
think, and we&rsquo;ll all be the best friends in the world. And now, because you&rsquo;ve been so good
to me, and understand so well how I dislike people who do nothing but pay me exaggerated
compliments, I&rsquo;ll sing and play a little for you.&rdquo;
Of course, we expressed our thanks and joy; but we would have been better pleased if
Ileen had remained in her low rocking-chair face to face with us and let us gaze upon her. For
she was no Adelina Patti&ndash; not even on the fare-wellest of the diva&rsquo;s farewell tours. She had a
cooing little voice like that of a turtle-dove that could almost fill the parlor when the
windows and doors were closed, and Betty was not rattling the lids of the stove in the
kitchen. She had a gamut that I estimate at about eight inches on the piano; and her runs
and trills sounded like the clothes bubbling in your grandmother&rsquo;s iron wash-pot. Believe
that she must have been beautiful when I tell you that it sounded like music to us.
&ldquo;She Must Have Been Beautiful When I Tell You That It Sounded Like Music To Us&rdquo;
Ileen&rsquo;s musical taste was catholic. She would sing through a pile of sheet music on the
left-hand top of the piano, laying each slaughtered composition on the right-hand top. The
next evening she would sing from right to left. Her favorites were Mendelssohn, and Moodyand Sankey. By request she always wound up with Sweet Violets and When the Leaves Begin
to Turn.
When we left at ten o&rsquo;clock the three of us would go down to Jacks&rsquo; little wooden
station and sit on the platform, swinging our feet and trying to pump one another for dews
as to which way Miss Ileen&rsquo;s inclinations seemed to lean. That is the way of rivals&ndash;they do
not avoid and glower at one another; they convene and converse and construe&ndash;striving by
the art politic to estimate the strength of the enemy.
One day there came a dark horse to Paloma, a young lawyer who at once flaunted his
shingle and himself spectacularly upon the town. His name was C. Vincent Vesey. You could
see at a glance that he was a recent graduate of a southwestern law school. His Prince Albert
coat, light striped trousers, broad-brimmed soft black hat, and narrow white muslin bow tie
proclaimed that more loudly than any diploma could. Vesey was a compound of Daniel
Webster, Lord Chesterfield, Beau Brummell, and Little Jack Horner. His coming boomed
Paloma. The next day after he arrived an addition to the town was surveyed and laid off in
lots.
Of course, Vesey, to further his professional fortunes, must mingle with the citizenry
and outliers of Paloma. And, as well as with the soldier men, he was bound to seek
popularity with the gay dogs of the place. So Jacks and Bud Cunningham and I came to be
honored by his acquaintance.
The doctrine of predestination would have been discredited had not Vesey seen Ileen
Hinkle and become fourth in the tourney. Magnificently, he boarded at the yellow pine hotel
instead of at the Parisian Restaurant; but he came to be a formidable visitor in the Hinkle
parlor. His competition reduced Bud to an inspired increase of profanity, drove Jacks to an
outburst of slang so weird that it sounded more horrible than the most trenchant of Bud&rsquo;s
imprecations, and made me dumb with gloom.
For Vesey had the rhetoric. Words flowed from him like oil from a gusher. Hyperbole,
compliment, praise, appreciation, honeyed gallantry, golden opinions, eulogy, and unveiled
panegyric vied with one another for pre-eminence in his speech. We had small hopes that
Ileen could resist his oratory and Prince Albert.
But a day came that gave us courage.
About dusk one evening I was sitting on the little gallery in front of the Hinkle parlor,
waiting for Ileen to come, when I heard voices inside. She had come into the room with her
father, and Old Man Hinkle began to talk to her. I had observed before that he was a shrewd
man, and not unphilosophic.
&ldquo;Ily,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I notice there&rsquo;s three or four young fellers that have been callin&rsquo; to see
you regular for quite a while. Is there any one of &lsquo;em you like better than another?&ldquo;&ldquo;Why, pa,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I like all of &lsquo;em very well. I think Mr. Cuninngham and Mr.
Jacks and Mr. Harris are very nice young men. They are so frank and honest in everything
they say to me. I haven&rsquo;t known Mr. Vesey very long, but I think he&rsquo;s a very nice young man,
he&rsquo;s so frank and honest in everything he says to me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gittin&rsquo; at,&rdquo; says old Hinkle. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always been sayin&rsquo; you like
people what tell the truth and don&rsquo;t go humbuggin&rsquo; you with compliments and bogus talk.
Now, suppose you make a test of these fellers, and see which one of &lsquo;em will talk the
straightest to you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But how&rsquo;ll I do it, pa?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how. You know you sing a little bit, Ily; you took music-lessons nearly two
years in Logansport. It wasn&rsquo;t long, but it was all we could afford then. And your teacher said
you didn&rsquo;t have any voice, and it was a waste of money to keep on. Now, suppose you ask
the fellers what they think of your singin&rsquo;, and see what each one of &lsquo;em tells you. The man
that &rsquo;ll tell you the truth about it &rsquo;ll have a mighty lot of nerve, and &rsquo;ll do to tie to. What do
you think of the plan?&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right, pa,&rdquo; said Ileen. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a good idea. I&rsquo;ll try it.&rdquo;
Ileen and Mr. Hinkle went out of the room through the inside doors. Unobserved, I
hurried down to the station. Jacks was at his telegraph table waiting for eight o&rsquo;clock to
come. It was Bud&rsquo;s night in town, and when he rode in I repeated the conversation to them
both. I was loyal to my rivals, as all true admirers of all Ileens should be.
Simultaneously the three of us were smitten by an uplifting thought. Surely this test
would eliminate Vesey from the contest. He, with his unctuous flattery, would be driven
from the lists. Well we remembered Ileen&rsquo;s love of frankness and honesty&ndash;how she
treasured truth and candor above vain compliment and blandishment.
Linking arms, we did a grotesque dance of joy up and down the platform, singing
Muldoon Was a Solid Man at the top of our voices.
That evening four of the willow rocking-chairs were filled besides the lucky one that
sustained the trim figure of Miss Hinkle. Three of us awaited with suppressed excitement the
application of the test. It was tried on Bud first.
&ldquo;Mr. Cunningham,&rdquo; said Ileen, with her dazzling smile, after she had sung When the
Leaves Begin to Turn, &ldquo;what do you really think of my voice? Frankly and honestly, now, as
you know I want you to always be toward me.&ldquo;Bud squirmed in his chair at his chance to show the sincerity that he knew was required
of him.
&ldquo;Tell you the truth, Miss Ileen,&rdquo; he said, earnestly, &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t got much more voice than
a weasel&ndash;just a little squeak, you know. Of course, we all like to hear you sing, for it&rsquo;s kind of
sweet and soothin&rsquo; after all, and you look most as mighty well sittin&rsquo; on the piano-stool as
you do faced around. But as for real singin&rsquo;&ndash;I reckon you couldn&rsquo;t call it that.&rdquo;
I looked closely at Ileen to see if Bud had overdone his frankness, but her pleased smile
and sweetly spoken thanks assured me that we were on the right track.
&ldquo;And what do you think, Mr. Jacks?&rdquo; she asked next. &ldquo;Take it from me,&rdquo; said Jacks, &ldquo;you
ain&rsquo;t in the prima donna class. I&rsquo;ve heard &lsquo;em warble in every city in the United States; and I
tell you your vocal output don&rsquo;t go. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ve got the grand opera bunch sent to the
soap factory&ndash;in looks, I mean; for the high screechers generally look like Mary Ann on her
Thursday out. But nix for the gargle work. Your epiglottis ain&rsquo;t a real side-stepper&ndash;its
footwork ain&rsquo;t good.&rdquo;
With a merry laugh at Jacks&rsquo; criticism, Ileen looked inquiringly at me.
I admit that I faltered a little. Was there not such a thing as being too frank? Perhaps I
even hedged a little in my verdict; but I stayed with the critics.
&ldquo;I am not skilled in scientific music, Miss Ileen,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but, frankly, I cannot praise very
highly the singing-voice that Nature has given you. It has long been a favorite comparison
that a great singer sings like a bird. Well, there are birds and birds. I would say that your
voice reminds me of the thrush&rsquo;s&ndash;throaty and not strong, nor of much compass or
variety&ndash;but still&ndash;er&ndash;sweet&ndash;in&ndash;er&ndash;its&ndash;way, and&ndash; er&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Harris,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Hinkle. &ldquo;I knew I could depend Upon your
frankness and honesty.&rdquo;
And then C. Vincent Vesey drew back one sleeve from his snowy cuff, and the water
came down at Lodore.
My memory cannot do justice to his masterly tribute to that priceless, God-given
treasure&ndash;Miss Hinkle&rsquo;s voice. He raved over it in terms that, if they had been addressed to
the morning stars when they sang together, would have made that stellar choir explode in a
meteoric shower of flaming self-satisfaction.
He marshalled on his white finger-tips the grand opera stars of all the continents, from
Jenny Lind to Emma Abbott, only to depreciate their endowments. He spoke of larynxes, of
chest notes, of phrasing, arpeggios, and other strange paraphernalia of the throaty art. He
admitted, as though driven to a corner, that Jenny Lind had a note or two in the high registerthat Miss Hinkle had not yet acquired&ndash;but&ndash; &ldquo;!!!&rdquo;-that was a mere matter of practice and
training.
And, as a peroration, he predicted&ndash;solemnly predicted&ndash;a career in vocal art for the
&ldquo;coming star of the Southwest&ndash;and one of which grand old Texas may well be proud,&rdquo;
hitherto unsurpassed in the annals of musical history.
When we left at ten, Ileen gave each of us her usual warm, cordial handshake,
entrancing smile, and invitation to call again. I could not see that one was favored above or
below another&ndash;but three of us knew&ndash;we knew.
We knew that frankness and honesty had won, and that the rivals now numbered three
instead of four.
Down at the station Jacks brought out a pint bottle of the proper stuff, and we
celebrated the downfall of a blatant interloper.
Four days went by without anything happening worthy of recount.
On the fifth, Jacks and I, entering the brush arbor for our supper, saw the Mexican
youth, instead of a divinity in a spotless waist and a navy-blue skirt, taking in the dollars
through the barbed-wire wicket.
We rushed into the kitchen, meeting Pa Hinkle coming out with two cups of hot coffee
in his hands.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ileen?&rdquo; we asked, in recitative.
Pa Hinkle was a kindly man. &ldquo;Well, gents,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it was a sudden notion she took;
but I&rsquo;ve got the money, and I let her have her way. She&rsquo;s gone to a corn&ndash;a conservatory in
Boston for four years for to have her voice cultivated. Now, excuse me to pass, gents, for this
coffee&rsquo;s hot, and my thumbs is tender.&rdquo;
That night there were four instead of three of us sitting on the station platform and
swinging our feet. C. Vincent Vesey was one of us. We discussed things while dogs barked at
the moon that rose, as big as a five-cent piece or a flour barrel, over the chaparral.
And what we discussed was whether it is better to lie to a woman or to tell her the
truth.
And as all of us were young then, we did not come to a decision.The Princess and the Puma （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>There had to be a king and queen, of course. The king was a terrible old man who wore
six-shooters and spurs, and shouted in such a tremendous voice that the rattlers on the
prairie would run into their holes under the prickly pear. Before there was a royal family they
called the man &ldquo;Whispering Ben.&rdquo; When he came to own 50,000 acres of land and more
cattle than he could count, they called him O&rsquo;Donnell &ldquo;the Cattle King.&rdquo;
The queen had been a Mexican girl from Laredo. She made a good, mild, Colorado-claro
wife, and even succeeded in teaching Ben to modify his voice sufficiently while in the house
to keep the dishes from being broken. When Ben got to be king she would sit on the gallery
of Espinosa Ranch and weave rush mats. When wealth became so irresistible and oppressive
that upholstered chairs and a centre table were brought down from San Antone in the
wagons, she bowed her smooth, dark head, and shared the fate of the Danae.
To avoid lese-majeste you have been presented first to the king and queen. They do not
enter the story, which might be called &ldquo;The Chronicle of the Princess, the Happy Thought,
and the Lion that Bungled his Job.&rdquo;
Josefa O&rsquo;Donnell was the surviving daughter, the princess. From her mother she
inherited warmth of nature and a dusky, semi-tropic beauty. From Ben O&rsquo;Donnell the royal
she acquired a store of intrepidity, common sense, and the faculty of ruling. The
combination was one worth going miles to see. Josefa while riding her pony at a gallop could
put five out of six bullets through a tomato-can swinging at the end of a string. She could
play for hours with a white kitten she owned, dressing it in all manner of absurd clothes.
Scorning a pencil, she could tell you out of her head what 1545 two-year-olds would bring
on the hoof, at $8.50 per head. Roughly speaking, the Espinosa Ranch is forty miles long and
thirty broad&ndash;but mostly leased land. Josefa, on her pony, had prospected over every mile of
it. Every cow-puncher on the range knew her by sight and was a loyal vassal. Ripley Givens,
foreman of one of the Espinosa outfits, saw her one day, and made up his mind to form a
royal matrimonial alliance. Presumptuous? No. In those days in the Nueces country a man
was a man. And, after all, the title of cattle king does not presuppose blood royalty. Often it
only signifies that its owner wears the crown in token of his magnificent qualities in the art
of cattle stealing.
One day Ripley Givens rode over to the Double Elm Ranch to inquire about a bunch of
strayed yearlings. He was late in setting out on his return trip, and it was sundown when he
struck the White Horse Crossing of the Nueces. From there to his own camp it was sixteen
miles. To the Espinosa ranch it was twelve. Givens was tired. He decided to pass the night at
the Crossing.There was a fine water hole in the river-bed. The banks were thickly covered with great
trees, undergrown with brush. Back from the water hole fifty yards was a stretch of curly
mesquite grass&ndash;supper for his horse and bed for himself. Givens staked his horse, and
spread out his saddle blankets to dry. He sat down with his back against a tree and rolled a
cigarette. From somewhere in the dense timber along the river came a sudden, rageful,
shivering wail. The pony danced at the end of his rope and blew a whistling snort of
comprehending fear. Givens puffed at his cigarette, but he reached leisurely for his
pistol-belt, which lay on the grass, and twirled the cylinder of his weapon tentatively. A great
gar plunged with a loud splash into the water hole. A little brown rabbit skipped around a
bunch of catclaw and sat twitching his whiskers and looking humorously at Givens. The pony
went on eating grass.
It is well to be reasonably watchful when a Mexican lion sings soprano along the
arroyos at sundown. The burden of his song may be that young calves and fat lambs are
scarce, and that he has a carnivorous desire for your acquaintance.
In the grass lay an empty fruit can, cast there by some former sojourner. Givens caught
sight of it with a grunt of satisfaction. In his coat pocket tied behind his saddle was a handful
or two of ground coffee. Black coffee and cigarettes! What ranchero could desire more?
In two minutes he had a little fire going clearly. He started, with his can, for the water
hole. When within fifteen yards of its edge he saw, between the bushes, a side-saddled pony
with down-dropped reins cropping grass a little distance to his left. Just rising from her
hands and knees on the brink of the water hole was Josefa O&rsquo;Donnell. She had been drinking
water, and she brushed the sand from the palms of her hands. Ten yards away, to her right,
half concealed by a clump of sacuista, Givens saw the crouching form of the Mexican lion.
His amber eyeballs glared hungrily; six feet from them was the tip of the tail stretched
straight, like a pointer&rsquo;s. His hind-quarters rocked with the motion of the cat tribe
preliminary to leaping.
Givens did what he could. His six-shooter was thirty-five yards away lying on the grass.
He gave a loud yell, and dashed between the lion and the princess.
The &ldquo;rucus,&rdquo; as Givens called it afterward, was brief and somewhat confused. When he
arrived on the line of attack he saw a dim streak in the air, and heard a couple of faint cracks.
Then a hundred pounds of Mexican lion plumped down upon his head and flattened him,
with a heavy jar, to the ground. He remembered calling out: &ldquo;Let up, now&ndash;no fair gouging!&rdquo;
and then he crawled from under the lion like a worm, with his mouth full of grass and dirt,
and a big lump on the back of his head where it had struck the root of a water-elm. The lion
lay motionless. Givens, feeling aggrieved, and suspicious of fouls, shook his fist at the lion,
and shouted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rastle you again for twenty&ndash;&rdquo; and then he got back to himself.
Josefa was standing in her tracks, quietly reloading her silver- mounted .38. It had not
been a difficult shot. The lion&rsquo;s head made an easier mark than a tomato-can swinging at theend of a string. There was a provoking, teasing, maddening smile upon her mouth and in her
dark eyes. The would-be-rescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul. Here
had been his chance, the chance that he had dreamed of; and Momus, and not Cupid, had
presided over it. The satyrs in the wood were, no doubt, holding their sides in hilarious,
silent laughter. There had been something like vaudeville&ndash;say Signor Givens and his funny
knockabout act with the stuffed lion.
&ldquo;Is that you, Mr. Givens?&rdquo; said Josefa, in her deliberate, saccharine contralto. &ldquo;You
nearly spoilt my shot when you yelled. Did you hurt your head when you fell?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Givens, quietly; &ldquo;that didn&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo; He stooped ignominiously and
dragged his best Stetson hat from under the beast. It was crushed and wrinkled to a fine
comedy effect. Then he knelt down and softly stroked the fierce, open-jawed head of the
dead lion.
&ldquo;Poor old Bill!&rdquo; he exclaimed mournfully.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Josefa, sharply.
&ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t know, Miss Josefa,&rdquo; said Givens, with an air of one allowing
magnanimity to triumph over grief. &ldquo;Nobody can blame you. I tried to save him, but I
couldn&rsquo;t let you know in time.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Save who?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, Bill. I&rsquo;ve been looking for him all day. You see, he&rsquo;s been our camp pet for two
years. Poor old fellow, he wouldn&rsquo;t have hurt a cottontail rabbit. It&rsquo;ll break the boys all up
when they hear about it. But you couldn&rsquo;t tell, of course, that Bill was just trying to play with
you.&rdquo;
Josefa&rsquo;s black eyes burned steadily upon him. Ripley Givens met the test successfully.
He stood rumpling the yellow-brown curls on his head pensively. In his eye was regret, not
unmingled with a gentle reproach. His smooth features were set to a pattern of indisputable
sorrow. Josefa wavered.
&ldquo;What was your pet doing here?&rdquo; she asked, making a last stand. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no camp near
the White Horse Crossing.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The old rascal ran away from camp yesterday,&rdquo; answered Givens readily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder
the coyotes didn&rsquo;t scare him to death. You see, Jim Webster, our horse wrangler, brought a
little terrier pup into camp last week. The pup made life miserable for Bill&ndash;he used to chase
him around and chew his hind legs for hours at a time. Every night when bedtime came Bill
would sneak under one of the boy&rsquo;s blankets and sleep to keep the pup from finding him. Ireckon he must have been worried pretty desperate or he wouldn&rsquo;t have run away. He was
always afraid to get out of sight of camp.&rdquo;
Josefa looked at the body of the fierce animal. Givens gently patted one of the
formidable paws that could have killed a yearling calf with one blow. Slowly a red flush
widened upon the dark olive face of the girl. Was it the signal of shame of the true
sportsman who has brought down ignoble quarry? Her eyes grew softer, and the lowered
lids drove away all their bright mockery.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; she said humbly; &ldquo;but he looked so big, and jumped so high that&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Poor old Bill was hungry,&rdquo; interrupted Givens, in quick defence of the deceased. &ldquo;We
always made him jump for his supper in camp. He would lie down and roll over for a piece of
meat. When he saw you he thought he was going to get something to eat from you.&rdquo;
Suddenly Josefa&rsquo;s eyes opened wide.
&ldquo;I might have shot you!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You ran right in between. You risked your life
to save your pet! That was fine, Mr. Givens. I like a man who is kind to animals.&rdquo;
Yes; there was even admiration in her gaze now. After all, there was a hero rising out of
the ruins of the anti-climax. The look on Givens&rsquo;s face would have secured him a high
position in the S.P.C.A.
&ldquo;I always loved &lsquo;em,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;horses, dogs, Mexican lions, cows, alligators&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I hate alligators,&rdquo; instantly demurred Josefa; &ldquo;crawly, muddy things!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Did I say alligators?&rdquo; said Givens. &ldquo;I meant antelopes, of course.&rdquo;
Josefa&rsquo;s conscience drove her to make further amends. She held out her hand
penitently. There was a bright, unshed drop in each of her eyes.
&ldquo;Please forgive me, Mr. Givens, won&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m only a girl, you know, and I was
frightened at first. I&rsquo;m very, very sorry I shot Bill. You don&rsquo;t know how ashamed I feel. I
wouldn&rsquo;t have done it for anything.&rdquo;
Givens took the proffered hand. He held it for a time while he allowed the generosity of
his nature to overcome his grief at the loss of Bill. At last it was clear that he had forgiven
her.
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t speak of it any more, Miss Josefa. &lsquo;Twas enough to frighten any young
lady the way Bill looked. I&rsquo;ll explain it all right to the boys.&ldquo;&ldquo;Are you really sure you don&rsquo;t hate me?&rdquo; Josefa came closer to him impulsively. Her
eyes were sweet&ndash;oh, sweet and pleading with gracious penitence. &ldquo;I would hate anyone
who would kill my kitten. And how daring and kind of you to risk being shot when you tried
to save him! How very few men would have done that!&rdquo; Victory wrested from defeat!
Vaudeville turned into drama! Bravo, Ripley Givens!
It was now twilight. Of course Miss Josefa could not be allowed to ride on to the
ranch-house alone. Givens resaddled his pony in spite of that animal&rsquo;s reproachful glances,
and rode with her. Side by side they galloped across the smooth grass, the princess and the
man who was kind to animals. The prairie odours of fruitful earth and delicate bloom were
thick and sweet around them. Coyotes yelping over there on the hill! No fear. And yet&ndash;
Josefa rode closer. A little hand seemed to grope. Givens found it with his own. The
ponies kept an even gait. The hands lingered together, and the owner of one explained:
&ldquo;I never was frightened before, but just think! How terrible it would be to meet a really
wild lion! Poor Bill! I&rsquo;m so glad you came with me!&rdquo;
O&rsquo;Donnell was sitting on the ranch gallery.
&ldquo;Hello, Rip!&rdquo; he shouted&ndash;&ldquo;that you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;He rode in with me,&rdquo; said Josefa. &ldquo;I lost my way and was late.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Much obliged,&rdquo; called the cattle king. &ldquo;Stop over, Rip, and ride to camp in the
morning.&rdquo;
But Givens would not. He would push on to camp. There was a bunch of steers to start
off on the trail at daybreak. He said good-night, and trotted away.
An hour later, when the lights were out, Josefa, in her night-robe, came to her door and
called to the king in his own room across the brick-paved hallway:
&ldquo;Say, pop, you know that old Mexican lion they call the &lsquo;Gotch-eared Devil&rsquo;&ndash;the one
that killed Gonzales, Mr. Martin&rsquo;s sheep herder, and about fifty calves on the Salado range?
Well, I settled his hash this afternoon over at the White Horse Crossing. Put two balls in his
head with my .38 while he was on the jump. I knew him by the slice gone from his left ear
that old Gonzales cut off with his machete. You couldn&rsquo;t have made a better shot yourself,
daddy.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bully for you!&rdquo; thundered Whispering Ben from the darkness of the royal chamber.Proof Of The Pudding （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Spring winked a vitreous optic at Editor Westbrook of the Minerva Magazine, and
deflected him from his course. He had lunched in his favorite corner of a Broadway hotel,
and was returning to his office when his feet became entangled in the lure of the vernal
coquette. Which is by way of saying that he turned eastward in Twenty-sixth Street, safely
forded the spring freshet of vehicles in Fifth Avenue, and meandered along the walks of
budding Madison Square.
The lenient air and the settings of the little park almost formed a pastoral; the color
motif was green - the presiding shade at the creation of man and vegetation.
The callow grass between the walks was the color of verdigris, a poisonous green,
reminiscent of the horde of derelict humans that had breathed upon the soil during the
summer and autumn. The bursting tree buds looked strangely familiar to those who had
botanized among the garnishings of the fish course of a forty-cent dinner. The sky above was
of that pale aquamarine tint that ballroom poets rhyme with &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sue&rdquo; and &ldquo;coo.&rdquo;
The one natural and frank color visible was the ostensible green of the newly painted
benches - a shade between the color of a pickled cucumber and that of a last year&rsquo;s
fast-black cravenette raincoat. But, to the city-bred eye of Editor Westbrook, the landscape
appeared a masterpiece.
And now, whether you are of those who rush in, or of the gentle concourse that fears to
tread, you must follow in a brief invasion of the editor&rsquo;s mind.
Editor Westbrook&rsquo;s spirit was contented and serene. The April number of the Minerva
had sold its entire edition before the tenth day of the month - a newsdealer in Keokuk had
written that he could have sold fifty copies more if he had &lsquo;em. The owners of the magazine
had raised his (the editor&rsquo;s) salary; he had just installed in his home a jewel of a recently
imported cook who was afraid of policemen; and the morning papers had published in full a
speech he had made at a publishers&rsquo; banquet. Also there were echoing in his mind the
jubilant notes of a splendid song that his charming young wife had sung to him before he left
his up-town apartment that morning. She was taking enthusiastic interest in her music of
late, practising early and diligently. When he had complimented her on the improvement in
her voice she had fairly hugged him for joy at his praise. He felt, too, the benign, tonic
medicament of the trained nurse, Spring, tripping softly adown the wards of the
convalescent city.
While Editor Westbrook was sauntering between the rows of park benches (already
filling with vagrants and the guardians of lawless childhood) he felt his sleeve grasped and
held. Suspecting that he was about to be panhandled, he turned a cold and unprofitableface, and saw that his captor was - Dawe - Shackleford Dawe, dingy, almost ragged, the
genteel scracely visible in him through the deeper lines of the shabby.
While the editor is pulling himself out of his surprise, a flashlight biography of Dawe is
offered.
He was a fiction writer, and one of Westbrook&rsquo;s old acquaintances. At one time they
might have called each other old friends. Dawe had some money in those days, and lived in
a decent apartment house near Westbrook&rsquo;s. The two families often went to theatres and
dinners together. Mrs. Dawe and Mrs. Westbrook became &ldquo;dearest&rdquo; friends. Then one day a
little tentacle of the octopus, just to amuse itself, ingurgitated Dawe&rsquo;s capital, and he moved
to the Gramercy Park neighborhood where one, for a few groats per week, may sit upon
one&rsquo;s trunk under eight-branched chandeliers and opposite Carrara marble mantels and
watch the mice play upon the floor. Dawe thought to live by writing fiction. Now and then
he sold a story. He submitted many to Westbrook. The Minerva printed one or two of them;
the rest were returned. Westbrook sent a careful and conscientious personal letter with
each rejected manuscript, pointing out in detail his reasons for considering it unavailable.
Editor Westbrook had his own clear conception of what constituted good fiction. So had
Dawe. Mrs. Dawe was mainly concerned about the constituents of the scanty dishes of food
that she managed to scrape together. One day Dawe had been spouting to her about the
excellencies of certain French writers. At dinner they sat down to a dish that a hungry
schoolboy could have encompassed at a gulp. Dawe commented.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Maupassant hash,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dawe. &ldquo;It may not be art, but I do wish you would do
a five-course Marion Crawford serial with an Ella Wheeler Wilcox sonnet for dessert. I&rsquo;m
hungry.&rdquo;
As far as this from success was Shackleford Dawe when he plucked Editor Westbrook&rsquo;s
sleeve in Madison Square. That was the first time the editor had seen Dawe in several
months.
&ldquo;Why, Shack, is this you?&rdquo; said Westbrook, somewhat awkwardly, for the form of his
phrase seemed to touch upon the other&rsquo;s changed appearance.
&ldquo;Sit down for a minute,&rdquo; said Dawe, tugging at his sleeve. &ldquo;This is my office. I can&rsquo;t
come to yours, looking as I do. Oh, sit down - you won&rsquo;t be disgraced. Those half-plucked
birds on the other benches will take you for a swell porch-climber. They won&rsquo;t know you are
only an editor.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Smoke, Shack?&rdquo; said Editor Westbrook, sinking cautiously upon the virulent green
bench. He always yielded gracefully when he did yield.
Dawe snapped at the cigar as a kingfisher darts at a sunperch, or a girl pecks at a
chocolate cream.&ldquo;I have just -&rdquo; began the editor.
&ldquo;Oh, I know; don&rsquo;t finish,&rdquo; said Dawe. &ldquo;Give me a match. You have just ten minutes to
spare. How did you manage to get past my office-boy and invade my sanctum? There he
goes now, throwing his club at a dog that couldn&rsquo;t read the &lsquo;Keep off the Grass&rsquo; signs.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How goes the writing?&rdquo; asked the editor.
&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; said Dawe, &ldquo;for your answer. Now don&rsquo;t put on that embarrassed,
friendly-but-honest look and ask me why I don&rsquo;t get a job as a wine agent or a cab driver. I&rsquo;m
in the fight to a finish. I know I can write good fiction and I&rsquo;ll force you fellows to admit it yet.
I&rsquo;ll make you change the spelling of &lsquo;regrets&rsquo; to &lsquo;c-h-e-q-u-e&rsquo; before I&rsquo;m done with you.&rdquo;
Editor Westbrook gazed through his nose-glasses with a sweetly sorrowful, omniscient,
sympathetic, skeptical expression - the copyrighted expression of the editor beleagured by
the unavailable contributor.
&ldquo;Have you read the last story I sent you - &lsquo;The Alarum of the Soul&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Dawe.
&ldquo;Carefully. I hesitated over that story, Shack, really I did. It had some good points. I was
writing you a letter to send with it when it goes back to you. I regret -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Never mind the regrets,&rdquo; said Dawe, grimly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s neither salve nor sting in &lsquo;em any
more. What I want to know is why. Come now; out with the good points first.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The story,&rdquo; said Westbrook, deliberately, after a suppressed sigh, &ldquo;is written around an
almost original plot. Characterization - the best you have done. Construction - almost as
good, except for a few weak joints which might be strengthened by a few changes and
touches. It was a good story, except -&rdquo;
&ldquo;I can write English, can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; interrupted Dawe.
&ldquo;I have always told you,&rdquo; said the editor, &ldquo;that you had a style.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then the trouble is -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Same old thing,&rdquo; said Editor Westbrook. &ldquo;You work up to your climax like an artist. And
then you turn yourself into a photographer. I don&rsquo;t know what form of obstinate madness
possesses you, but that is what you do with everything that you write. No, I will retract the
comparison with the photographer. Now and then photography, in spite of its impossible
perspective, manages to record a fleeting glimpse of truth. But you spoil every denouement
by those flat, drab, obliterating strokes of your brush that I have so often complained of. If
you would rise to the literary pinnacle of your dramatic senses, and paint them in the highcolors that art requires, the postman would leave fewer bulky, self-addressed envelopes at
your door.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, fiddles and footlights!&rdquo; cried Dawe, derisively. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got that old sawmill drama
kink in your brain yet. When the man with the black mustache kidnaps golden-haired Bessie
you are bound to have the mother kneel and raise her hands in the spotlight and say: &lsquo;May
high heaven witness that I will rest neither night nor day till the heartless villain that has
stolen me child feels the weight of another&rsquo;s vengeance!&lsquo;&rdquo;
Editor Westbrook conceded a smile of impervious complacency.
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that in real life the woman would express herself in those words or
in very similar ones.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not in a six hundred nights&rsquo; run anywhere but on the stage,&rdquo; said Dawe hotly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
you what she&rsquo;d say in real life. She&rsquo;d say: &lsquo;What! Bessie led away by a strange man? Good
Lord! It&rsquo;s one trouble after another! Get my other hat, I must hurry around to the
police-station. Why wasn&rsquo;t somebody looking after her, I&rsquo;d like to know? For God&rsquo;s sake, get
out of my way or I&rsquo;ll never get ready. Not that hat - the brown one with the velvet bows.
Bessie must have been crazy; she&rsquo;s usually shy of strangers. Is that too much powder? Lordy!
How I&rsquo;m upset!&rsquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way she&rsquo;d talk,&rdquo; continued Dawe. &ldquo;People in real life don&rsquo;t fly into heroics
and blank verse at emotional crises. They simply can&rsquo;t do it. If they talk at all on such
occasions they draw from the same vocabulary that they use every day, and muddle up their
words and ideas a little more, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shack,&rdquo; said Editor Westbrook impressively, &ldquo;did you ever pick up the mangled and
lifeless form of a child from under the fender of a street car, and carry it in your arms and lay
it down before the distracted mother? Did you ever do that and listen to the words of grief
and despair as they flowed spontaneously from her lips?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I never did,&rdquo; said Dawe. &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; said Editor Westbrook, with a slight frown. &ldquo;But I can well imagine what she
would say.&rdquo;
&ldquo;So can I,&rdquo; said Dawe.
And now the fitting time had come for Editor Westbrook to play the oracle and silence
his opinionated contributor. It was not for an unarrived fictionist to dictate words to be
uttered by the heroes and heroines of the Minerva Magazine, contrary to the theories of the
editor thereof.&ldquo;My dear Shack,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if I know anything of life I know that every sudden, deep and
tragic emotion in the human heart calls forth an apposite, concordant, conformable and
proportionate expression of feeling. How much of this inevitable accord between expression
and feeling should be attributed to nature, and how much to the influence of art, it would
be difficult to say. The sublimely terrible roar of the lioness that has been deprived of her
cubs is dramatically as far above her customary whine and purr as the kingly and
transcendent utterances of Lear are above the level of his senile vaporings. But it is also true
that all men and women have what may be called a sub-conscious dramatic sense that is
awakened by a sufficiently deep and powerful emotion - a sense unconsciously acquired
from literature and the stage that prompts them to express those emotions in language
befitting their importance and histrionic value.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And in the name of the seven sacred saddle-blankets of Sagittarius, where did the
stage and literature get the stunt?&rdquo; asked Dawe.
&ldquo;From life,&rdquo; answered the editor, triumphantly.
The story writer rose from the bench and gesticulated eloquently but dumbly. He was
beggared for words with which to formulate adequately his dissent.
On a bench nearby a frowzy loafer opened his red eyes and perceived that his moral
support was due a downtrodden brother.
&ldquo;Punch him one, Jack,&rdquo; he called hoarsely to Dawe. &ldquo;W&rsquo;at&rsquo;s he come makin&rsquo; a noise like
a penny arcade for amongst gen&rsquo;lemen that comes in the square to set and think?&rdquo;
Editor Westbrook looked at his watch with an affected show of leisure.
&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; asked Dawe, with truculent anxiety, &ldquo;what especial faults in &lsquo;The Alarum of
the Soul&rsquo; caused you to throw it down?&rdquo;
&ldquo;When Gabriel Murray,&rdquo; said Westbrook, &ldquo;goes to his telephone and is told that his
fiancee has been shot by a burglar, he says - I do not recall the exact words, but -&rdquo;
&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Dawe. &ldquo;He says: &lsquo;Damn Central; she always cuts me off.&rsquo; (And then to his
friend) &lsquo;Say, Tommy, does a thirty-two bullet make a big hole? It&rsquo;s kind of hard luck, ain&rsquo;t it?
Could you get me a drink from the sideboard, Tommy? No; straight; nothing on the side.&lsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;And again,&rdquo; continued the editor, without pausing for argument, &ldquo;when Berenice
opens the letter from her husband informing her that he has fled with the manicure girl, her
words are - let me see -&rdquo;
&ldquo;She says,&rdquo; interposed the author: &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, what do you think of that!&rsquo;&rdquo;&ldquo;Absurdly inappropriate words,&rdquo; said Westbrook, &ldquo;presenting an anti-climax - plunging
the story into hopeless bathos. Worse yet; they mirror life falsely. No human being ever
uttered banal colloquialisms when confronted by sudden tragedy.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Wrong,&rdquo; said Dawe, closing his unshaven jaws doggedly. &ldquo;I say no man or woman ever
spouts &lsquo;high-falutin&rsquo; talk when they go up against a real climax. They talk naturally and a
little worse.&rdquo;
The editor rose from the bench with his air of indulgence and inside information.
&ldquo;Say, Westbrook,&rdquo; said Dawe, pinning him by the lapel, &ldquo;would you have accepted &lsquo;The
Alarum of the Soul&rsquo; if you had believed that the actions and words of the characters were
true to life in the parts of the story that we discussed?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is very likely that I would, if I believed that way,&rdquo; said the editor. &ldquo;But I have
explained to you that I do not.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If I could prove to you that I am right?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Shack, but I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t time to argue any further just now.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to argue,&rdquo; said Dave. &ldquo;I want to demonstrate to you from life itself that my
view is the correct one.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How could you do that?&rdquo; asked Westbrook, in a surprised tone.
&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the writer, seriously. &ldquo;I have thought of a way. It is important to me that
my theory of true-to-life fiction be recognized as correct by the magazines. I&rsquo;ve fought for it
for three years, and I&rsquo;m down to my last dollar, with two months&rsquo; rent due.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have applied the opposite of your theory,&rdquo; said the editor, &ldquo;in selecting the fiction for
the Minerva Magazine. The circulation has gone up from ninety thousand to -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Four hundred thousand,&rdquo; said Dawe. &ldquo;Whereas it should have been boosted to a
million.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You said something to me just now about demonstrating your pet theory.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I will. If you&rsquo;ll give me about half an hour of your time I&rsquo;ll prove to you that I am right.
I&rsquo;ll prove it by Louise.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Your wife!&rdquo; exclaimed Westbrook. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;&ldquo;Well, not exactly by her, but with her,&rdquo; said Dawe. &ldquo;Now, you know how devoted and
loving Louse has always been. She thinks I&rsquo;m the only genuine preparation on the market
that bears the old doctor&rsquo;s signature. She&rsquo;s been fonder and more faithful than ever, since
I&rsquo;ve been cast for the neglected genius part.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Indeed, she is a charming and admirable life companion,&rdquo; agreed the editor. &ldquo;I
remember what inseparable friends she and Mrs. Westbrook once were. We are both lucky
chaps, Shack, to have such wives. You must bring Mrs. Dawe up some evening soon, and
we&rsquo;ll have one of those informal chafing-dish suppers that we used to enjoy so much.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Later,&rdquo; said Dawe. &ldquo;When I get another shirt. And now I&rsquo;ll tell you my scheme. When I
was about to leave home after breakfast - if you can call tea and oatmeal breakfast - Louise
told me she was going to visit her aunt in Eighty-ninth Street. She said she would return at
three o&rsquo;clock. She is always on time to a minute. It is now -&rdquo;
Dawe glanced toward the editor&rsquo;s watch pocket.
&ldquo;Twenty-seven minutes to three,&rdquo; said Westbrook, scanning his time-piece.
&ldquo;We have just enough time,&rdquo; said Dawe. &ldquo;We will go to my flat at once. I will write a
note, address it to her and leave it on the table where she will see it as she enters the door.
You and I will be in the dining-room concealed by the portieres. In that note I&rsquo;ll say that I
have fled from her forever with an affinity who understands the need of my artistic soul as
she never did. When she reads it we will observe her actions and hear her words. Then we
will know which theory is the correct one - yours or mine.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, never!&rdquo; exclaimed the editor, shaking his head. &ldquo;That would be inexcusably cruel. I
could not consent to have Mrs. Dawe&rsquo;s feelings played upon in such a manner.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Brace up,&rdquo; said the writer. &ldquo;I guess I think as much of her as you do. It&rsquo;s for her benefit
as well as mine. I&rsquo;ve got to get a market for my stories in some way. It won&rsquo;t hurt Louise.
She&rsquo;s healthy and sound. Her heart goes as strong as a ninety-eight-cent watch. It&rsquo;ll last for
only a minute, and then I&rsquo;ll step out and explain to her. You really owe it to me to give me
the chance, Westbrook.&rdquo;
Editor Westbrook at length yielded, though but half willingly. And in the half of him that
consented lurked the vivisectionist that is in all of us. Let him who has not used the scalpel
rise and stand in his place. Pity &lsquo;tis that there are not enough rabbits and guinea-pigs to go
around.
The two experimenters in Art left the Square and hurried eastward and then to that
south until they arrived in the Gramercy neighborhood. Within its high iron railings the little
park had put on its smart coat of vernal green, and was admiring itself in its fountain mirror.
Outside the railings the hollow square of crumbling houses, shells of a bygone gentry, leanedas if in ghostly gossip over the forgotten doings of the vanished quality. Sic transit gloria
urbis.
A block or two north of the Park, Dawe steered the editor again eastward, then, after
covering a short distance, into a lofty but narrow flathouse burdened with a floridly
over-decorated fa,cade. To the fifth story they toiled, and Dawe, panting, pushed his
latch-key into the door of one of the front flats.
When the door opened Editor Westbrook saw, with feelings of pity, how meanly and
meagerly the rooms were furnished.
&ldquo;Get a chair, if you can find one,&rdquo; said Dawe, &ldquo;while I hunt up pen and ink. Hello, what&rsquo;s
this? Here&rsquo;s a note from Louise. She must have left it there when she went out this
morning.&rdquo;
He picked up an envelope that lay on the centre-table and tore it open. He began to
read the letter that he drew out of it; and once having begun it aloud he so read it through
to the end. These are the words that Editor Westbrook heard:
&ldquo;Dear Shackleford:
&ldquo;By the time you get this I will be about a hundred miles away and still a-going. I&rsquo;ve got
a place in the chorus of the Occidental Opera Co., and we start on the road to-day at twelve
o&rsquo;clock. I didn&rsquo;t want to starve to death, and so I decided to make my own living. I&rsquo;m not
coming back. Mrs. Westbrook is going with me. She said she was tired of living with a
combination phonograph, iceberg and dictionary, and she&rsquo;s not coming back, either. We&rsquo;ve
been practising the songs and dances for two months on the quiet. I hope you will be
successful, and get along all right! Good-bye.
&ldquo;Louise.&rdquo;
Dawe dropped the letter, covered his face with his trembling hands, and cried out in a
deep, vibrating voice:
&ldquo;My God, why hast thou given me this cup to drink? Since she is false, then let Thy
Heaven&rsquo;s fairest gifts, faith and love, become the jesting by-words of traitors and fiends!&rdquo;
Editor Westbrook&rsquo;s glasses fell to the floor. The fingers of one hand fumbled with a
button on his coat as he blurted between his pale lips:
&ldquo;Say, Shack, ain&rsquo;t that a hell of a note? Wouldn&rsquo;t that knock you off your perch, Shack?
Ain&rsquo;t it hell, now, Shack - ain&rsquo;t it?&ldquo;Psyche And The Pskyscraper （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>If you are a philosopher you can do this thing: you can go to the top of a high building,
look down upon your fellow-men 300 feet below, and despise them as insects. Like the
irresponsible black waterbugs on summer ponds, they crawl and circle and hustle about
idiotically without aim or purpose. They do not even move with the admirable intelligence of
ants, for ants always know when they are going home. The ant is of a lowly station, but he
will often reach home and get his slippers on while you are left at your elevated station.
Man, then, to the housetopped philosopher, appears to be but a creeping,
contemptible beetle. Brokers, poets, millionaires, bootblacks, beauties, hod-carriers and
politicians become little black specks dodging bigger black specks in streets no wider than
your thumb.
From this high view the city itself becomes degraded to an unintelligible mass of
distorted buildings and impossible perspectives; the revered ocean is a duck pond; the earth
itself a lost golf ball. All the minutiae of life are gone. The philosopher gazes into the infinite
heavens above him, and allows his soul to expand to the influence of his new view. He feels
that he is the heir to Eternity and the child of Time. Space, too, should be his by the right of
his immortal heritage, and he thrills at the thought that some day his kind shall traverse
theose mysterious aerial roads between planet and planet. The tiny world beneath his feet
upon which this towering structure of steel rests as a speck of dust upon a Himalayan
mountain - it is but one of a countless number of such whirling atoms. What are the
ambitions, the achievements, the paltry conquests and loves of those restless black insects
below compared with the serene and awful immensity of the universe that lies above and
around their insignificant city?
It is guaranteed that the philosopher will have these thoughts. They have been
expressly compiled from the philosophies of the world and set down with the proper
interrogation point at the end of them to represent the invariable musings of deep thinkers
on high places. And when the philosopher takes the elevator down his mind is broader, his
heart is at peace, and his conception of the cosmogony of creation is as wide as the buckle
of Orion&rsquo;s summer belt.
But if your name happened to be Daisy, and you worked in an Eighth Avenue candy
store and lived in a little cold hall bedroom, five feet by eight, and earned $6 per week, and
ate ten-cent lunches and were nineteen years old, and got up at 6:30 and worked till 9, and
never had studied philosophy, maybe things wouldn&rsquo;t look that way to you from the top of a
skyscraper.Two sighed for the hand of Daisy, the unphilosophical. One was Joe, who kept the
smallest store in New York. It was about the size of a tool-box of the D. P. W., and was stuck
like a swallow&rsquo;s nest against a corner of a down-town skyscraper. Its stock consisted of fruit,
candies, newspapers, song books, cigarettes, and lemonade in season. When stern winter
shook his congealed locks and Joe had to move himself and the fruit inside, there was
exactly room in the store for the proprietor, his wares, a stove the size of a vinegar cruet,
and one customer.
Joe was not of the nation that keeps us forever in a furore with fugues and fruit. He was
a capable American youth who was laying by money, and wanted Daisy to help him spend it.
Three times he had asked her.
&ldquo;I got money saved up, Daisy,&rdquo; was his love song; &ldquo;and you know how bad I want you.
That store of mine ain&rsquo;t very big, but -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; would be the antiphony of the unphilosophical one. &ldquo;Why, I heard
Wanamaker&rsquo;s was trying to get you to sublet part of your floor space to them for next year.&rdquo;
Daisy passed Joe&rsquo;s corner every morning and evening.
&ldquo;Hello, Two-by-Four!&rdquo; was her usual greeting. &ldquo;Seems to me your store looks emptier.
You must have sold a pack of chewing gum.&rdquo;
Ain&rsquo;t much room in here, sure,&rdquo; Joe would answer, with his slow grin, &ldquo;except for you,
Daise. Me and the store are waitin&rsquo; for you whenever you&rsquo;ll take us. Don&rsquo;t you think you
might before long?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Store!&rdquo; - a fine scorn was expressed by Daisy&rsquo;s uptilted nose - &ldquo;sardine box! Waitin&rsquo; for
me, you say? Gee! you&rsquo;d have to throw out about a hundred pounds of candy before I could
get inside of it, Joe.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind an even swap like that,&rdquo; said Joe, complimentary.
Daisy&rsquo;s existence was limited in every way. She had to walk sideways between the
counter and the shelves in the candy store. In her own hall bedroom coziness had been
carried close to cohesiveness. The walls were so near to one another that the paper on them
made a perfect Babel of noise. She could light the gas with one hand and close the door with
the other without taking her eyes off the reflection of her brown pompadour in the mirror.
She had Joe&rsquo;s picture in a gilt frame on the dresser, and sometimes - but her next thought
would always be of Joe&rsquo;s funny little store tacked like a soap box to the corner of that great
building, and away would go her sentiment in a breeze of laughter.
Daisy&rsquo;s other suitor followed Joe by several months. He came to board in the house
where she lived. His name was Dabster, and he was a philosopher. Though young,attainments stood out upon him like continental labels on a Passaic (N. J.) suit-case.
Knowledge he had kidnapped from cyclopedias and handbooks of useful information; but as
for wisdom, when she passed he was left sniffling in the road without so much as the
number of her motor car. He could and would tell you the proportion of water and
muscle-making properties of peas and veal, the shortest verse in the Bible, the number of
pounds of shingle nails required to fasten 256 shingles laid four inches to the weather, the
population of Kankakee, Ill., the theories of Spinoza, the name of Mr. H. McKay Twombly&rsquo;s
second hall footman, the length of the Hoosac Tunnel, the best time to set a hen, the salary
of the railway post-office messenger between Driftwood and Red Bank Furnace, Pa., and the
number of bones in the foreleg of a cat.
The weight of learning was no handicap to Dabster. His statistics were the sprigs of
parsley with which he garnished the feast of small talk that he would set before you if he
conceived that to be your taste. And again he used them as breastworks in foraging at the
boardinghouse. Firing at you a volley of figures concerning the weight of a lineal foot of
bar-iron 5 x 2 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches, and the average annual rainfall at Fort Snelling, Minn., he would
transfix with his fork the best piece of chicken on the dish while you were trying to rally
sufficiently to ask him weakly why does a hen cross the road.
Thus, brightly armed, and further equipped with a measure of good looks, of a hair-oily,
shopping-district-at-three-in-the-afternoon kind, it seems that Joe, of the Lilliputian
emporium, had a rival worthy of his steel.
But Joe carried no steel. There wouldn&rsquo;t have been room in his store to draw it if he
had.
One Saturday afternoon, about four o&rsquo;clock, Daisy and Mr. Dabster stopped before Joe&rsquo;s
booth. Dabster wore a silk hat, and - well, Daisy was a woman, and that hat had no chance
to get back in its box until Joe had seen it. A stick of pineapple chewing gum was the
ostensible object of the call. Joe supplied it through the open side of his store. He did not
pale or falter at sight of the hat.
&ldquo;Mr. Dabster&rsquo;s going to take me on top of the building to observe the view,&rdquo; said Daisy,
after she had introduced her admirers. &ldquo;I never was on a skyscraper. I guess it must be
awfully nice and funny up there.&rdquo;
&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Joe.
&ldquo;The panorama,&rdquo; said Mr. Dabster, &ldquo;exposed to the gaze from the top of a lofty building
is not only sublime, but instructive. Miss Daisy has a decided pleasure in store for her.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s windy up there, too, as well as here,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Are you dressed warm enough,
Daise?&ldquo;&ldquo;Sure thing! I&rsquo;m all lined,&rdquo; said Daisy, smiling slyly at his clouded brow. &ldquo;You look just
like a mummy in a case, Joe. Ain&rsquo;t you just put in an invoice of a pint of peanuts or another
apple? Your stock looks awful over-stocked.&rdquo;
Daisy giggled at her favorite joke; and Joe had to smile with her.
&ldquo;Your quarters are somewhat limited, Mr. - er - er,&rdquo; remarked Dabster, &ldquo;in comparison
with the size of this building. I understand the area of its side to be about 340 by 100 feet.
That would make you occupy a proportionate space as if half of Beloochistan were placed
upon a territory as large as the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, with the Province
of Ontario and Belgium added.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Is that so, sport?&rdquo; said Joe, genially. &ldquo;You are Weisenheimer on figures, all right. How
many square pounds of baled hay do you think a jackass could eat if he stopped brayin&rsquo; long
enough to keep still a minute and five eighths?&rdquo;
A few minutes later Daisy and Mr. Dabster stepped from an elevator to the top floor of
the skyscraper. Then up a short, steep stairway and out upon the roof. Dabster led her to the
parapet so she could look down at the black dots moving in the street below.
&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; she asked, trembling. She had never before been on a height like this
before.
And then Dabster must needs play the philosopher on the tower, and conduct her soul
forth to meet the immensity of space.
&ldquo;Bipeds,&rdquo; he said, solemnly. &ldquo;See what they become even at the small elevation of 340
feet - mere crawling insects going to and fro at random.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, they ain&rsquo;t anything of the kind,&rdquo; exclaimed Daisy, suddenly - &ldquo;they&rsquo;re folks! I saw
an automobile. Oh, gee! are we that high up?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Walk over this way,&rdquo; said Dabster.
He showed her the great city lying like an orderly array of toys far below, starred here
and there, early as it was, by the first beacon lights of the winter afternoon. And then the
bay and sea to the south and east vanishing mysteriously into the sky.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; declared Daisy, with troubled blue eyes. &ldquo;Say we go down.&rdquo;
But the philosopher was not to be denied his opportunity. He would let her behold the
grandeur of his mind, the half-nelson he had on the infinite, and the memory he had for
statistics. And then she would nevermore be content to buy chewing gum aat the smallest
store in New York. And so he began to prate of the smallness of human affairs, and how thateven so slight a removal from earth made man and his works look like one tenth part of a
dollar thrice computed. And that one should consider the sidereal system and the maxims of
Epictetus and be comforted.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t carry me with you,&rdquo; said Daisy. &ldquo;Say, I think it&rsquo;s awful to be up so high that
folks look like fleas. One of them we saw might have been Joe. Why, Jiminy! we might as well
be in New Jersey! Say, I&rsquo;m afraid up here!&rdquo;
The philosopher smiled fatuously.
&ldquo;The earth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is itself only as a grain of wheat in space. Look up there.&rdquo;
Daisy gazed upward apprehensively. The short day was spent and the stars were coming
out above.
&ldquo;Yonder star,&rdquo; said Dabster, &ldquo;is Venus, the evening star. She is 66,000,000 miles from the
sun.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fudge!&rdquo; said Daisy, with a brief flash of spirit, &ldquo;where do you think I come from -
Brooklyn? Susie Price, in our store - her brother sent her a ticket to go to San Francisco -
that&rsquo;s only three thousand miles.&rdquo;
The philosopher smiled indulgently.
&ldquo;Our world,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is 91,000,000 miles from the sun. There are eighteen stars of the
first magnitude that are 211,000 times further from us than the sun is. If one of them should
be extinguished it would be three years before we would see its light go out. There are six
thousand stars of the sixth magnitude. It takes thirty-six years for the light of one of them to
reach the earth. With an eighteen-foot telescope we can see 43,000,000 stars, including
those of the thirteenth magnitude, whose light takes 2,700 years to reach us. Each of these
stars -&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lyin&rsquo;,&rdquo; cried Daisy, angrily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re tryin&rsquo; to scare me. And you have; I want to go
down!&rdquo;
She stamped her foot.
&ldquo;Arcturus -&rdquo; began the philosopher, soothingly, but he was interrupted by a
demonstration out of the vastness of the nature that he was endeavoring to portray with his
memory instead of his heart. For to the heart-expounder of nature the stars were set in the
firmament expressly to give soft light to lovers wandering happily beneath them; and if you
stand tiptoe some September night with your sweetheart on your arm you can almost touch
them with your hand. Three years for their light to reach us, indeed!Out of the west leaped a meteor, lighting the roof of the skyscraper almost to midday.
Its fiery parabola was limned against the sky toward the east. It hissed as it went, and Daisy
screamed.
&ldquo;Take me down,&rdquo; she cried, vehemently, &ldquo;you - you mental arithmetic!&rdquo;
Dabster got her to the elevator, and inside of it. She was wild-eyed, and she shuddered
when the express made its debilitating drop.
Outside the revolving door of the skyscraper the philosopher lost her. She vanished;
and he stood, bewildered, without figures or statistics to aid him.
Joe had a lull in trade, and by squirming among his stock succeeded in lighting a
cigarette and getting one cold foot against the attenuated stove.
The door was burst open, and Daisy, laughing, crying, scattering fruit and candies,
tumbled into his arms.
&ldquo;Oh, Joe, I&rsquo;ve been up on the skyscraper. Ain&rsquo;t it cozy and warm and homelike in here!
I&rsquo;m ready for you, Joe, whenever you want me.&rdquo;
A Ramble In Aphasia （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>My wife and I parted on that morning in precisely our usual manner. She left her
second cup of tea to follow me to the front door. There she plucked from my lapel the
invisible strand of lint (the universal act of woman to proclaim ownership) and bade me to
take care of my cold. I had no cold. Next came her kiss of parting - the lever kiss of
domesticity flavored with Young Hyson. There was no fear of the extemporaneous, of variety
spicing her infinite custom. With the deft touch of long malpractice, she dabbed awry my
well-set scarf pin; and then, as I closed the door, I heard her morning slippers pattering back
to her cooling tea.
When I set out I had no thought or premonition of what was to occur. The attack came
suddenly.
For many weeks I had been toiling, almost night and day, at a famous railroad law case
that I won triumphantly but a few days previously. In fact, I had been digging away at the law
almost without cessation for many years. Once or twice good Doctor Volney, my friend and
physician, had warned me.&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t slacken up, Belford,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll go suddenly to pieces. Either your
nerves or your brain will give way. Tell me, does a week pass in which you do not read in the
papers of a case of aphasia - of some man lost, wandering nameless, with his past and his
identity blotted out - and all from that little brain clot made by overwork or worry?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I always thought,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the clot in those instances was really to be found on the
brains of the newspaper reporters.&rdquo;
Doctor Volney shook his head.
&ldquo;The disease exists,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You need a change or a rest. Court-room, office and
home - there is the only route you travel. For recreation you - read law books. Better take
warning in time.&rdquo;
&ldquo;On Thursday nights,&rdquo; I said, defensively, &ldquo;my wife and I play cribbage. On Sundays she
reads to me the weekly letter from her mother. That law books are not a recreation remains
yet to be established.&rdquo;
That morning as I walked I was thinking of Doctor Volney&rsquo;s words. I was feeling as well
as I usually did - possibly in better spirits than usual.
I woke with stiff and cramped muscles from having slept long on the incommodious
seat of a day coach. I leaned my head against the seat and tried to think. After a long time I
said to myself: &ldquo;I must have a name of some sort.&rdquo; I searched my pockets. Not a card; not a
letter; not a paper or monogram could I find. But I found in my coat pocket nearly $3,000 in
bills of large denomination. &ldquo;I must be some one, of course,&rdquo; I repeated to myself, and began
again to consider.
The car was well crowded with men, among whom, I told myself, there must have been
some common interest, for they intermingled freely, and seemed in the best good humor
and spirits. One of them - a stout, spectacled gentleman enveloped in a decided odor of
cinnamon and aloes - took the vacant half of my seat with a friendly nod, and unfolded a
newspaper. In the intervals between his periods of reading, we conversed, as travelers will,
on current affairs. I found myself able to sustain the conversation on such subjects with
credit, at least to my memory. By and by my companion said:
&ldquo;You are one of us, of course. Fine lot of men the West sends in this time. I&rsquo;m glad they
held the convention in New York; I&rsquo;ve never been East before. My name&rsquo;s R. P. Bolder -
Bolder &amp; Son, of Hickory Grove, Missouri.&rdquo;
Though unprepared, I rose to the emergency, as men will when put to it. Now must I
hold a christening, and be at once babe, parson and parent. My senses came to the rescue
of my slower brain. The insistent odor of drugs from my compainion supplied one idea; aglance at his newspaper, where my eye met a conspicuous advertisement, assisted me
further.
&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; said I, glibly, &ldquo;is Edward Pinkhammer. I am a druggist, and my home is in
Cornopolis, Kansas.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I knew you were a druggist,&rdquo; said my fellow traveler, affably. &ldquo;I saw the callous spot on
your right forefinger where the handle of the pestle rubs. Of course, you are a delegate to
our National Convention.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Are all these men druggists?&rdquo; I asked, wonderingly.
&ldquo;They are. This car came through from the West. And they&rsquo;re your old-time druggists,
too - none of your patent tablet-and-granule pharmashootists that use slot machines instead
of a prescription desk. We percolate our own paregoric and roll our own pills, and we ain&rsquo;t
above handling a few garden seeds in the spring, and carrying a side line of confectionery
and shoes. I tell you Hampinker, I&rsquo;ve got an idea to spring on this convention - new ideas is
what they want. Now, you know the shelf bottles of tartar emetic and Rochelle salt Ant. et
Pot. Tart. and Sod. et Pot. Tart. - one&rsquo;s poison, you know, and the other&rsquo;s harmless. It&rsquo;s easy
to mistake one label for the other. Where do druggists mostly keep &lsquo;em? Why, as far apart as
possible, on different shelves. That&rsquo;s wrong. I say keep &lsquo;em side by side, so when you want
one you can always compare it with the other and avoid mistakes. Do you catch the idea?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It seems to me a very good one,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;All right! When I spring it on the convention you back it up. We&rsquo;ll make some of these
Eastern orange-phosphate-and-massage-cream professors that think they&rsquo;re the only
lozenges in the market look like hypodermic tablets.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If I can be of any aid,&rdquo; I said, warming, &ldquo;the two bottles of - er -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tartrate of antimony and potash, and tartrate of soda and potash.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shall henceforth sit side by side,&rdquo; I concluded, firmly.
&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; said Mr. Bolder. &ldquo;For an excipient in manipulating a pill
mass which do you prefer - the magnesia carbonate or the pulverised glycerrhiza radix?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The - er - magnesia,&rdquo; I said. It was easier to say than the other word.
Mr. Bolder glanced at me distrustfully through his spectacles.
&ldquo;Give me the glycerrhiza,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Magnesia cakes.&rdquo;&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another one of these fake aphasia cases,&rdquo; he said, presently, handing me his
newspaper, and laying his finger upon an article. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in &lsquo;em. I put nine out of ten
of &lsquo;em down as frauds. A man gets sick of his business and his folks and wants to have a
good time. He skips out somewhere, and when they find him he pretends to have lost his
memory - don&rsquo;t know his own name, and won&rsquo;t even recognize the strawberry mark on his
wife&rsquo;s left shoulder. Aphasia! Tut! Why can&rsquo;t they stay at home and forget?&rdquo;
I took the paper and read, after the pungent headlines, the following:
&ldquo;DENVER, June 12. - Elwyn C. Belford, a prominent lawyer, is mysteriously missing from
his home since three days ago, and all efforts to locate him have been in vain. Mr. Bellford is
a well-known citizen of the highest standing, and has enjoyed a large and lucrative law
practice. He is married and owns a fine home and the most extensive private library in the
State. On the day of his disappearance, he drew quite a large sum of money from his bank.
No one can be found who saw him after he left the bank. Mr. Bellford was a man of
singularly quiet and domestic tastes, and seemed to find his happiness in his home and
profession. If any clue at all exists to his strange disappearance, it my be found in the fact
that for some months he has been deeply absorbed in an important law case in connection
with the Q. Y. and Z. Railroad Company. It is feared that overwork may have affected his
mind. Every effort is being made to discover the whereabouts of the missing man.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It seems to me you are not altogether uncynical, Mr. Bolder,&rdquo; I said, after I had read
the despatch. &ldquo;This has the sound, to me, of a genuine case. Why should this man,
prosperous, happily married, and respected, choose suddenly to abandon everything? I
know that these lapses of memory do occur, and that men do find themselves adrift without
a name, a history or a home.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, gammon and jalap!&rdquo; said Mr. Bolder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s larks they&rsquo;re after. There&rsquo;s too much
education nowadays. Men know about aphasia, and they use it for an excuse. The women
are wise, too. When it&rsquo;s all over they look you in the eye, as scientific as you please, and say:
&lsquo;He hypnotized me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Thus Mr. Bolder diverted, but did not aid, me with his comments and philosophy.
We arrived in New York about ten at night. I rode in a cab to a hotel, and I wrote my
name &ldquo;Edward Pinkhammer&rdquo; in the register. As I did so I felt pervade me a splendid, wild,
intoxicating buoyancy - a sense of unlimited freedom, of newly attained possibilities. I was
just born into the world. The old fetters - whatever they had been - were stricken from my
hands and feet. The future lay before me a clear road such as an infant enters, and I could
set out upon it equipped with a man&rsquo;s learning and experience.
I thought the hotel clerk looked at me five seconds too long. I had no baggage.&ldquo;The Druggists&rsquo; Convention,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;My trunk has somehow failed to arrive.&rdquo; I drew
out a roll of money.
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, showing an auriferous tooth, &ldquo;we have quite a number of the Western
delegates stopping here.&rdquo; He struck a bell for the boy.
I endeavored to give color to my role.
&ldquo;There is an important movement on foot among us Westerners,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;in regard to a
recommendation to the convention that the bottles containing the tartrate of antimoney
and potash, and the tartrate of sodium and potash be kept in a contiguous position on the
shelf.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Gentleman to three-fourteen,&rdquo; said the clerk, hastily. I was whisked away to my room.
The next day I bought a trunk and clothing, and began to live the life of Edward
Pinkhammer. I did not tax my brain with endeavors to solve problems of the past.
It was a piquant and sparkling cup that the great island city held up to my lips. I drank
of it gratefully. The keys of Manhattan belong to him who is able to bear them. You must be
either the city&rsquo;s guest or its victim.
The following few days were as gold and silver. Edward Pinkhammer, yet counting back
to his birth by hours only, knew the rare joy of having come upon so diverting a world
full-fledged and unrestrained. I sat entranced on the magic carpets provided in theatres and
roof-gardens, that transported one into strange and delightful lands full of frolicsome music,
pretty girls and grotesque drolly extravagant parodies upon human kind. I went here and
there at my own dear will, bound by no limits of space, time or comportment. I dined in
weird cabarets, at weirder tables d&rsquo;hote to the sound of Hungarian music and the wild
shouts of mercurial artists and sculptors. Or, again, where the night life quivers in the
electric glare like a kinetoscopic picture, and the millinery of the world, and its jewels, and
the ones whom they adorn, and the men who make all three possible are met for good
cheer and the spectacular effect. And among all these scenes that I have mentioned I
learned one thing that I never knew before. And that is that the key to liberty is not in the
hands of License, but Convention holds it. Comity has a toll-gate at which you must pay, or
you may not enter the land of Freedom. In all the glitter, the seeming disorder, the parade,
the abandon, I saw this law, unobtrusive, yet like iron, prevail. Therefore, in Manhattan you
must obey these unwritten laws, and then you will be freest of the free. If you decline to be
bound by them, you put on shackles.
Sometimes, as my mood urged me, I would seek the stately, softly murmuring palm
rooms, redolent with high-born life and delicate restraint, in which to dine. Again I would go
down to the waterways in steamers packed with vociferous, bedecked, unchecked
love-making clerks and shop-girls to their crude pleasures on the island shores. And therewas always Broadway - glistening, opulent, wily, varying, desirable Broadway - growing upon
one like an opium habit.
One afternoon as I entered my hotel a stout man with a big nose and a black mustache
blocked my way in the corridor. When I would have passed around him, he greet me with
offensive familiarity.
&ldquo;Hello, Bellford!&rdquo; he cried, loudly. &ldquo;What the deuce are you doing in New York? Didn&rsquo;t
know anything could drag you away from that old book den of yours. Is Mrs. B. along or is
this a little business run alone, eh?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You have made a mistake, sir,&rdquo; I said, coldly, releasing my hand from his grasp. &ldquo;My
name is Pinkhammer. You will excuse me.&rdquo;
The man dropped to one side, apparently astonished. As I walked to the clerk&rsquo;s desk I
heard him call to a bell boy and say something about telegraph blanks.
&ldquo;You will give me my bill,&rdquo; I said to the clerk, &ldquo;and have my baggage brought down in
half an hour. I do not care to remain where I am annoyed by confidence men.&rdquo;
I moved that afternoon to another hotel, a sedate, old-fashioned one on lower Fifth
Avenue.
There was a restaurant a little way off Broadway where one could be served almost al
fresco in a tropic array of screening flora. Quiet and luxury and a perfect service made it an
ideal place in which to take luncheon or refreshment. One afternoon I was there picking my
way to a table among the ferns when I felt my sleeve caught.
&ldquo;Mr. Bellford!&rdquo; exclaimed an amazingly sweet voice.
I turned quickly to see a lady seated alone - a lady of about thirty, with exceedingly
handsome eyes, who looked at me as though I had been her very dear friend.
&ldquo;You were about to pass me,&rdquo; she said, accusingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you do not know me.
Why should we not shake hands - at least once in fifteen years?&rdquo;
I shook hands with her at once. I took a chair opposite her at the table. I summoned
with my eyebrows a hovering waiter. The lady was philandering with an orange ice. I ordered
a creme de menthe. Her hair was reddish bronze. You could not look at it, because you could
not look away from her eyes. But you were conscious of it as you are conscious of sunset
while you look into the profundities of a wood at twilight.
&ldquo;Are you sure you know me?&rdquo; I asked.&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, smiling. &ldquo;I was never sure of that.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What would you think,&rdquo; I said, a little anxiously, &ldquo;if I were to tell you that my name is
Edward Pinkhammer, from Cornopolis, Kansas?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What would I think?&rdquo; she repeated, with a merry glance. &ldquo;Why, that you had not
brought Mrs. Bellford to New York with you, of course. I do wish you had. I would have liked
to see Marian.&rdquo; Her voice lowered slightly - &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t changed much, Elwyn.&rdquo;
I felt her wonderful eyes searching mine and my face more closely.
&ldquo;Yes, you have,&rdquo; she amended, and there was a soft, exultant note in her latest tones; &ldquo;I
see it now. You haven&rsquo;t forgotten. You haven&rsquo;t forgotten for a year or a day or an hour. I told
you you never could.&rdquo;
I poked my straw anxiously in the creme de menthe.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I said, a little uneasy at her gaze. &ldquo;But that is just the
trouble. I have forgotten. I&rsquo;ve forgotten everything.&rdquo;
She flouted my denial. She laughed deliciously at something she seemed to see in my
face.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of you at times,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite a big lawyer out West - Denver,
isn&rsquo;t it, or Los Angeles? Marian must be very proud of you. You knew, I suppose, that I
married six months after you did. You may have seen it in the papers. The flowers alone cost
two thousand dollars.&rdquo;
She had mentioned fifteen years. Fifteen years is a long time.
&ldquo;Would it be too late,&rdquo; I asked, somewhat timorously, &ldquo;to offer you congratulations?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not if you dare do it,&rdquo; she answered, with such fine intrepidity that I was silent, and
began to crease patterns on the cloth with my thumb nail.
&ldquo;Tell me one thing,&rdquo; she said, leaning toward me rather eagerly - &ldquo;a thing I have wanted
to know for many years - just from a woman&rsquo;s curiosity, of course - have you ever dared
since that night to touch, smell or look at white roses - at white roses wet with rain and
dew?&rdquo;
I took a sip of creme de menthe.&ldquo;It would be useless, I suppose,&rdquo; I said, with a sigh, &ldquo;for me to repeat that I have no
recollection at all about these things. My memory is completely at fault. I need not say how
much I regret it.&rdquo;
The lady rested her arms upon the table, and again her eyes disdained my words and
went traveling by their own route direct to my soul. She laughed softly, with a strange
quality in the sound - it was a laugh of happiness - yes, and of content - and of misery. I tried
to look away from her.
&ldquo;You lie, Elwyn Bellford,&rdquo; she breathed, blissfully. &ldquo;Oh, I know you lie!&rdquo;
I gazed dully into the ferns.
&ldquo;My name is Edward Pinkhammer,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I came with the delegates to the Druggists&rsquo;
National Convention. There is a movement on foot for arranging a new position for the
bottles of tartrate of antimony and tartrate of potash, in which, very likely, you would take
little interest.&rdquo;
A shining landau stopped before the entrance. The lady rose. I took her hand, and
bowed.
&ldquo;I am deeply sorry,&rdquo; I said to her, &ldquo;that I cannot remember. I could explain, but fear you
would not understand. You will not concede Pinkhammer; and I really cannot at all conceive
of the - the roses and other things.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Bellford,&rdquo; she said, with her happy, sorrowful smile, as she stepped into
her carriage.
I attended the theatre that night. When I returned to my hotel, a quiet man in dark
clothes, who seemed interested in rubbing his finger nails with a silk handkerchief, appeared,
magically, at my side.
&ldquo;Mr. Pinkhammer,&rdquo; he said, giving the bulk of his attention to his forefinger, &ldquo;may I
request you to step aside with me for a little conversation? There is a room here.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I answered.
He conducted me into a small, private parlor. A lady and a gentleman were there. The
lady, I surmised, would have been unusually good-looking had her features not been clouded
by an expression of keen worry and fatigue. She was of a style of figure and possessed
coloring and features that were agreeable to my fancy. She was in a traveling dress; she fixed
upon me an earnest look of extreme anxiety, and pressed an unsteady hand to her bosom. I
think she would have started forward, but the gentleman arrested her movement with anauthoritative motion of his hand. He then came, himself, to meet me. He was a man of forty,
a little gray about the temples, and with a strong, thoughtful face.
&ldquo;Bellford, old man,&rdquo; he said, cordially, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you again. Of course we know
everything is all right. I warned you, you know, that you were overdoing it. Now, you&rsquo;ll go
back with us, and be yourself again in no time.&rdquo;
I smiled ironically.
&ldquo;I have been &lsquo;Bellforded&rsquo; so often,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that it has lost its edge. Still, in the end, it
may grow wearisome. Would you be willing at all to entertain the hypothesis that my name
is Edward Pinkhammer, and that I never saw you before in my life?&rdquo;
Before the man could reply a wailing cry came from the woman. She sprang past his
detaining arm. &ldquo;Elwyn!&rdquo; she sobbed, and cast herself upon me, and clung tight. &ldquo;Elwyn,&rdquo; she
cried again, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t break my heart. I am your wife - call my name once - just once. I could
see you dead rather than this way.&rdquo;
I unwound her arms respectfully, but firmly.
&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; I said, severely, &ldquo;pardon me if I suggest that you accept a resemblance too
precipitately. It is a pity,&rdquo; I went on, with an amused laugh, as the thought occurred to me,
&ldquo;that this Bellford and I could not be kept side by side upon the same shelf like tartrates of
sodium and antimony for purposes of identification. In order to understand the allusion,&rdquo; I
concluded airily, &ldquo;it may be necessary for you to keep an eye on the proceedings of the
Druggists&rsquo; National Convention.&rdquo;
The lady turned to her companion, and grasped his arm.
&ldquo;What is it, Doctor Volney? Oh, what is it?&rdquo; she moaned.
&ldquo;Go to your room for a while,&rdquo; I heard him say. &ldquo;I will remain and talk with him. His
mind? No, I think not - only a portion of the brain. Yes, I am sure he will recover. Go to your
room and leave me with him.&rdquo;
The lady disappeared. The man in dark clothes also went outside, still manicuring
himself in a thoughtful way. I think he waited in the hall.
&ldquo;I would like to talk with you a while, Mr. Pinkhammer, if I may,&rdquo; said the gentleman
who remained.
&ldquo;Very well, if you care to,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and will excuse me if I take it comfortably; I am
rather tired.&rdquo; I stretched myself upon a couch by a window and lit a cigar. He drew a chair
nearby.&ldquo;Let us speak to the point,&rdquo; he said, soothingly. &ldquo;Your name is not Pinkhammer.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know that as well as you do,&rdquo; I said, coolly. &ldquo;But a man must have a name of some
sort. I can assure you that I do not extravagantly admire the name of Pinkhammer. But when
one christens one&rsquo;s self suddenly, the fine names do not seem to suggest themselves. But,
suppose it had been Scheringhausen or Scroggins! I think I did very well with Pinkhammer.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Your name,&rdquo; said the other man, seriously, &ldquo;is Elwyn C. Bellford. You are one of the
first lawyers in Denver. You are suffering from an attack of aphasia, which has caused you to
forget your identity. The cause of it was over-application to your profession, and, perhaps, a
life too bare of natural recreation and pleasures. The lady who has just left the room is your
wife.&rdquo;
&ldquo;She is what I would call a fine-looking woman,&rdquo; I said, after a judicial pause. &ldquo;I
particularly admire the shade of brown in her hair.&rdquo;
&ldquo;She is a wife to be proud of. Since your disappearance, nearly two weeks ago, she has
scarcely closed her eyes. We learned that you were in New York through a telegram sent by
Isidore Newman, a traveling man from Denver. He said that he had met you in a hotel here,
and that you did not recognize him.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I think I remember the occasion,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;The fellow called me &lsquo;Bellford,&rsquo; if I am not
mistaken. But don&rsquo;t you think it about time, now, for you to introduce yourself?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am Robert Volney - Doctor Volney. I have been your close friend for twenty years, and
your physician for fifteen. I came with Mrs. Bellford to trace you as soon as we got the
telegram. Try, Elwyn, old man - try to remember!&rdquo;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use to try?&rdquo; I asked, with a little frown. &ldquo;You say you are a physician. Is
aphasia curable? When a man loses his memory does it return slowly, or suddenly?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sometimes gradually and imperfectly; sometimes as suddenly as it went.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Will you undertake the treatment of my case, Doctor Volney?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;Old friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do everything in my power, and will have done everything
that science can do to cure you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Then you will consider that I am your patient. Everything is in
confidence now - professional confidence.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Doctor Volney.I got up from the couch. Some one had set a vase of white roses on the centre table - a
cluster of white roses, freshly sprinkled and fragrant. I threw them far out of the window,
and then laid myself upon the couch again.
&ldquo;It will be best, Bobby,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to have this cure happen suddenly. I&rsquo;m rather tired of it
all, anyway. You may go now and bring Marian in. But, oh, Doc,&rdquo; I said, with a sigh, as I kicked
him on the shin - &ldquo;good old Doc - it was glorious!&rdquo;
The Ransom of Mack （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Me and old Mack Lonsbury, we got out of that Little Hide-and-Seek gold mine affair
with about $40,000 apiece. I say &ldquo;old&rdquo; Mack; but he wasn&rsquo;t old. Forty-one, I should say; but
he always seemed old.
&ldquo;Andy,&rdquo; he says to me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of hustling. You and me have been working hard
together for three years. Say we knock off for a while, and spend some of this idle money
we&rsquo;ve coaxed our way.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The proposition hits me just right,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be nabobs for a while and see how it
feels. What&rsquo;ll we do&ndash;take in the Niagara Falls, or buck at faro?&rdquo;
&ldquo;For a good many years,&rdquo; says Mack, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought that if I ever had extravagant money
I&rsquo;d rent a two-room cabin somewhere, hire a Chinaman to cook, and sit in my stocking feet
and read Buckle&rsquo;s History of Civilisation.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That sounds self-indulgent and gratifying without vulgar ostentation,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;and I
don&rsquo;t see how money could be better invested. Give me a cuckoo clock and a Sep Winner&rsquo;s
Self-Instructor for the Banjo, and I&rsquo;ll join you.&rdquo;
A week afterwards me and Mack hits this small town of Pina, about thirty miles out
from Denver, and finds an elegant two-room house that just suits us. We deposited
half-a-peck of money in the Pina bank and shook hands with every one of the 340 citizens in
the town. We brought along the Chinaman and the cuckoo clock and Buckle and the
Instructor with us from Denver; and they made the cabin seem like home at once.
Never believe it when they tell you riches don&rsquo;t bring happiness. If you could have seen
old Mack sitting in his rocking-chair with his blue-yarn sock feet up in the window and
absorbing in that Buckle stuff through his specs you&rsquo;d have seen a picture of content that
would have made Rockefeller jealous. And I was learning to pick out &ldquo;Old Zip Coon&rdquo; on the
banjo, and the cuckoo was on time with his remarks, and Ah Sing was messing up theatmosphere with the handsomest smell of ham and eggs that ever laid the honeysuckle in
the shade. When it got too dark to make out Buckle&rsquo;s nonsense and the notes in the
Instructor, me and Mack would light our pipes and talk about science and pearl diving and
sciatica and Egypt and spelling and fish and trade-winds and leather and gratitude and
eagles, and a lot of subjects that we&rsquo;d never had time to explain our sentiments about
before.
One evening Mack spoke up and asked me if I was much apprised in the habits and
policies of women folks.
&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; says I, in a tone of voice; &ldquo;I know &lsquo;em from Alfred to Omaha. The feminine
nature and similitude,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;is as plain to my sight as the Rocky Mountains is to a
blue-eyed burro. I&rsquo;m onto all their little side-steps and punctual discrepancies.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I tell you, Andy,&rdquo; says Mack, with a kind of sigh, &ldquo;I never had the least amount of
intersection with their predispositions. Maybe I might have had a proneness in respect to
their vicinity, but I never took the time. I made my own living since I was fourteen; and I
never seemed to get my ratiocinations equipped with the sentiments usually depicted
toward the sect. I sometimes wish I had,&rdquo; says old Mack.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re an adverse study,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and adapted to points of view. Although they vary in
rationale, I have found &lsquo;em quite often obviously differing from each other in divergences of
contrast.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; goes on Mack, &ldquo;that a man had better take &lsquo;em in and secure his
inspirations of the sect when he&rsquo;s young and so preordained. I let my chance go by; and I
guess I&rsquo;m too old now to go hopping into the curriculum.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I tells him. &ldquo;Maybe you better credit yourself with a barrel of money
and a lot of emancipation from a quantity of uncontent. Still, I don&rsquo;t regret my knowledge of
&lsquo;em,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;It takes a man who understands the symptoms and by-plays of women-folks to
take care of himself in this world.&rdquo;
We stayed on in Pina because we liked the place. Some folks might enjoy their money
with noise and rapture and locomotion; but me and Mack we had had plenty of turmoils and
hotel towels. The people were friendly; Ah Sing got the swing of the grub we liked; Mack
and Buckle were as thick as two body-snatchers, and I was hitting out a cordial resemblance
to &ldquo;Buffalo Gals, Can&rsquo;t You Come Out To-night,&rdquo; on the banjo.
One day I got a telegram from Speight, the man that was working on a mine I had an
interest in out in New Mexico. I had to go out there; and I was gone two months. I was
anxious to get back to Pina and enjoy life once more.When I struck the cabin I nearly fainted. Mack was standing in the door; and if angels
ever wept, I saw no reason why they should be smiling then.
That man was a spectacle. Yes; he was worse; he was a spyglass; he was the great
telescope in the Lick Observatory. He had on a coat and shiny shoes and a white vest and a
high silk hat; and a geranium as big as an order of spinach was spiked onto his front. And he
was smirking and warping his face like an infernal storekeeper or a kid with colic.
&ldquo;Hello, Andy,&rdquo; says Mack, out of his face. &ldquo;Glad to see you back. Things have happened
since you went away.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and a sacrilegious sight it is. God never made you that way, Mack
Lonsbury. Why do you scarify His works with this presumptuous kind of ribaldry?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, Andy,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve elected me justice of the peace since you left.&rdquo;
I looked at Mack close. He was restless and inspired. A justice of the peace ought to be
disconsolate and assuaged.
Just then a young woman passed on the sidewalk; and I saw Mack kind of half snicker
and blush, and then he raised up his hat and smiled and bowed, and she smiled and bowed,
and went on by.
&ldquo;No hope for you,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ve got the Mary-Jane infirmity at your age. I thought it
wasn&rsquo;t going to take on you. And patent leather shoes! All this in two little short months!&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to marry the young lady who just passed to-night,&rdquo; says Mack, in a kind of
flutter.
&ldquo;I forgot something at the post-office,&rdquo; says I, and walked away quick.
I overtook that young woman a hundred yards away. I raised my hat and told her my
name. She was about nineteen; and young for her age. She blushed, and then looked at me
cool, like I was the snow scene from the &ldquo;Two Orphans.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I understand you are to be married to-night,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;You got any objections?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Listen, sissy,&rdquo; I begins.
&ldquo;My name is Miss Rebosa Redd,&rdquo; says she in a pained way.&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Now, Rebosa, I&rsquo;m old enough to have owed money to your father.
And that old, specious, dressed-up, garbled, sea-sick ptomaine prancing about avidiously like
an irremediable turkey gobbler with patent leather shoes on is my best friend. Why did you
go and get him invested in this marriage business?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, he was the only chance there was,&rdquo; answers Miss Rebosa.
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says I, giving a sickening look of admiration at her complexion and style of
features; &ldquo;with your beauty you might pick any kind of a man. Listen, Rebosa. Old Mack ain&rsquo;t
the man you want. He was twenty- two when you was nee Reed, as the papers say. This
bursting into bloom won&rsquo;t last with him. He&rsquo;s all ventilated with oldness and rectitude and
decay. Old Mack&rsquo;s down with a case of Indian summer. He overlooked his bet when he was
young; and now he&rsquo;s suing Nature for the interest on the promissory note he took from
Cupid instead of the cash. Rebosa, are you bent on having this marriage occur?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, sure I am,&rdquo; says she, oscillating the pansies on her hat, &ldquo;and so is somebody else,
I reckon.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What time is it to take place?&rdquo; I asks.
&ldquo;At six o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; says she.
I made up my mind right away what to do. I&rsquo;d save old Mack if I could. To have a good,
seasoned, ineligible man like that turn chicken for a girl that hadn&rsquo;t quit eating slate pencils
and buttoning in the back was more than I could look on with easiness.
&ldquo;Rebosa,&rdquo; says I, earnest, drawing upon my display of knowledge concerning the
feminine intuitions of reason&ndash;&ldquo;ain&rsquo;t there a young man in Pina&ndash;a nice young man that you
think a heap of?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; says Rebosa, nodding her pansies&ndash;&ldquo;Sure there is! What do you think! Gracious!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Does he like you?&rdquo; I asks. &ldquo;How does he stand in the matter?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Crazy,&rdquo; says Rebosa. &ldquo;Ma has to wet down the front steps to keep him from sitting
there all the time. But I guess that&rsquo;ll be all over after to-night,&rdquo; she winds up with a sigh.
&ldquo;Rebosa,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t really experience any of this adoration called love for old
Mack, do you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lord! no,&rdquo; says the girl, shaking her head. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s as dry as a lava bed. The idea!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Who is this young man that you like, Rebosa?&rdquo; I inquires.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Eddie Bayles,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;He clerks in Crosby&rsquo;s grocery. But he don&rsquo;t make but
thirty-five a month. Ella Noakes was wild about him once.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Old Mack tells me,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;s going to marry you at six o&rsquo;clock this evening.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the time,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to be at our house.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Rebosa,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;listen to me. If Eddie Bayles had a thousand dollars cash&ndash;a thousand
dollars, mind you, would buy him a store of his own&ndash;if you and Eddie had that much to
excuse matrimony on, would you consent to marry him this evening at five o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
The girl looks at me a minute; and I can see these inaudible cogitations going on inside
of her, as women will.
&ldquo;A thousand dollars?&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;Of course I would.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go and see Eddie.&rdquo;
We went up to Crosby&rsquo;s store and called Eddie outside. He looked to be estimable and
freckled; and he had chills and fever when I made my proposition.
&ldquo;At five o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for a thousand dollars? Please don&rsquo;t wake me up! Well, you
are the rich uncle retired from the spice business in India! I&rsquo;ll buy out old Crosby and run the
store myself.&rdquo;
We went inside and got old man Crosby apart and explained it. I wrote my check for a
thousand dollars and handed it to him. If Eddie and Rebosa married each other at five he
was to turn the money over to them.
And then I gave &lsquo;em my blessing, and went to wander in the wildwood for a season. I
sat on a log and made cogitations on life and old age and the zodiac and the ways of women
and all the disorder that goes with a lifetime. I passed myself congratulations that I had
probably saved my old friend Mack from his attack of Indian summer. I knew when he got
well of it and shed his infatuation and his patent leather shoes, he would feel grateful. &ldquo;To
keep old Mack disinvolved,&rdquo; thinks I, &ldquo;from relapses like this, is worth more than a thousand
dollars.&rdquo; And most of all I was glad that I&rsquo;d made a study of women, and wasn&rsquo;t to be
deceived any by their means of conceit and evolution.
It must have been half-past five when I got back home. I stepped in; and there sat old
Mack on the back of his neck in his old clothes with his blue socks on the window and the
History of Civilisation propped up on his knees.
&ldquo;This don&rsquo;t look like getting ready for a wedding at six,&rdquo; I says, to seem innocent.&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says Mack, reaching for his tobacco, &ldquo;that was postponed back to five o&rsquo;clock.
They sent me over a note saying the hour had been changed. It&rsquo;s all over now. What made
you stay away so long, Andy?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You heard about the wedding?&rdquo; I asks.
&ldquo;I operated it,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I told you I was justice of the peace. The preacher is off East to
visit his folks, and I&rsquo;m the only one in town that can perform the dispensations of marriage. I
promised Eddie and Rebosa a month ago I&rsquo;d marry &lsquo;em. He&rsquo;s a busy lad; and he&rsquo;ll have a
grocery of his own some day.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He will,&rdquo; says I.
&ldquo;There was lots of women at the wedding,&rdquo; says Mack, smoking up. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t seem
to get any ideas from &lsquo;em. I wish I was informed in the structure of their attainments like you
said you was.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That was two months ago,&rdquo; says I, reaching up for the banjo.
The Ransom of Red Chief （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>IT LOOKED like a good thing: but wait till I tell you. We were down South, in Alabama &ndash;
Bill Driscoll and myself &ndash; when this kidnapping idea struck us. It was, as Bill afterward
expressed it, &ldquo;during a moment of temporary mental apparition&rdquo;; but we didn&rsquo;t find that out
till later.
There was a town down there, as flat as a flannel-cake, and called Summit, of course. It
contained inhabitants Of as undeleterious and self-satisfied a class of peasantry as ever
clustered around a Maypole.
Bill and me had a joint capital of about six hundred dollars, and we needed just two
thousand dollars more to pull off a fraudulent town-lot scheme in Western Illinois with. We
talked it over on the front steps of the hotel. Philoprogenitiveness, says we, is strong in
semi-rural communities; therefore and for other reasons, a kidnapping project ought to do
better there than in the radius of newspapers that send reporters out in plain clothes to stir
up talk about such things. We knew that Summit couldn&rsquo;t get after us with anything stronger
than constables and maybe some lackadaisical bloodhounds and a diatribe or two in the
Weekly Farmers&rsquo; Budget. So, it looked good.We selected for our victim the only child of a prominent citizen named Ebenezer Dorset.
The father was respectable and tight, a mortgage fancier and a stern, upright
collection-plate passer and forecloser. The kid was a boy of ten, with bas-relief freckles, and
hair the colour of the cover of the magazine you buy at the news-stand when you want to
catch a train. Bill and me figured that Ebenezer would melt down for a ransom of two
thousand dollars to a cent. But wait till I tell you.
About two miles from Summit was a little mountain, covered with a dense cedar brake.
On the rear elevation of this mountain was a cave. There we stored provisions. One evening
after sundown, we drove in a buggy past old Dorset&rsquo;s house. The kid was in the street,
throwing rocks at a kitten on the opposite fence.
&ldquo;Hey, little boy!&rdquo; says Bill, &ldquo;would you like to have a bag of candy and a nice ride?&rdquo;
The boy catches Bill neatly in the eye with a piece of brick.
&ldquo;That will cost the old man an extra five hundred dollars,&rdquo; says Bill, climbing over the
wheel.
That boy put up a fight like a welter-weight cinnamon bear; but, at last, we got him
down in the bottom of the buggy and drove away. We took him up to the cave and I hitched
the horse in the cedar brake. After dark I drove the buggy to the little village, three miles
away, where we had hired it, and walked back to the mountain.
Bill was pasting court-plaster over the scratches and bruises on his features. There was
a burning behind the big rock at the entrance of the cave, and the boy was watching a pot of
boiling coffee, with two buzzard tailfeathers stuck in his red hair. He points a stick at me
when I come up, and says:
&ldquo;Ha! cursed paleface, do you dare to enter the camp of Red Chief, the terror of the
plains?
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; says Bill, rolling up his trousers and examining some bruises on his
shins. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re playing Indian. We&rsquo;re making Buffalo Bill&rsquo;s show look like magic-lantern views
of Palestine in the town hall. I&rsquo;m Old Hank, the Trapper, Red Chief&rsquo;s captive, and I&rsquo;m to be
scalped at daybreak. By Geronimo! that kid can kick hard.&rdquo;
Yes, sir, that boy seemed to be having the time of his life. The fun of camping out in a
cave had made him forget that he was a captive, himself. He immediately christened me
Snake-eye, the Spy, and announced that, when his braves returned from the warpath, I was
to be broiled at the stake at the rising of the sun.
Then we had supper; and he filled his mouth full of bacon and bread and gravy, and
began to talk. He made a during-dinner speech something like this:&ldquo;I like this fine. I never camped out before; but I had a pet &lsquo;possum once, and I was nine
last birthday. I hate to go to school. Rats ate up sixteen of Jimmy Talbot&rsquo;s aunt&rsquo;s speckled
hen&rsquo;s eggs. Are there any real Indians in these woods? I want some more gravy. Does the
trees moving make the wind blow? We had five puppies. What makes your nose so red,
Hank? My father has lots of money. Are the stars hot? I whipped Ed Walker twice, Saturday. I
don&rsquo;t like girls. You dassent catch toads unless with a string. Do oxen make any noise? Why
are oranges round? Have you got beds to sleep on in this cave? Amos Murray has got Six
toes. A parrot can talk, but a monkey or a fish can&rsquo;t. How many does it take to make
twelve?&rdquo;
Every few minutes he would remember that he was a pesky redskin, and pick up his
stick rifle and tiptoe to the mouth of the cave to rubber for the scouts of the hated paleface.
Now and then he would let out a war-whoop that made Old Hank the Trapper shiver. That
boy had Bill terrorized from the start.
&ldquo;Red Chief,&rdquo; says I to the kid, &ldquo;would you like to go home?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Aw, what for?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any fun at home. I hate to go to school. I like to
camp out. You won&rsquo;t take me back home again, Snake-eye, will you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not right away,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay here in the cave a while.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be fine. I never had such fun in all my life.&rdquo;
We went to bed about eleven o&rsquo;clock. We spread down some wide blankets and quilts
and put Red Chief between us. We weren&rsquo;t afraid he&rsquo;d run away. He kept us awake for three
hours, jumping up and reaching for his rifle and screeching: &ldquo;Hist! pard,&rdquo; in mine and Bill&rsquo;s
ears, as the fancied crackle of a twig or the rustle of a leaf revealed to his young imagination
the stealthy approach of the outlaw band. At last, I fell into a troubled sleep, and dreamed
that I had been kidnapped and chained to a tree by a ferocious pirate with red hair.
Just at daybreak, I was awakened by a series of awful screams from Bill. They weren&rsquo;t
yells, or howls, or shouts, or whoops, or yalps, such as you&rsquo;d expect from a manly set of
vocal organs &ndash; they were simply indecent, terrifying, humiliating screams, such as women
emit when they see ghosts or caterpillars. It&rsquo;s an awful thing to hear a strong, desperate, fat
man scream incontinently in a cave at daybreak.
I jumped up to see what the matter was. Red Chief was sitting on Bill&rsquo;s chest, with one
hand twined in Bill&rsquo;s hair. In the other he had the sharp case-knife we used for slicing, bacon;
and he was industriously and realistically trying to take Bill&rsquo;s scalp, according to the sentence
that had been pronounced upon him the evening before.I got the knife away from the kid and made him lie down again. But, from that moment,
Bill&rsquo;s spirit was broken. He laid down on his side of the bed, but he never closed an eye again
in sleep as long as that boy was with us. I dozed off for a while, but along toward sun-up I
remembered that Red Chief had said I was to be burned at the stake at the rising of the sun.
I wasn&rsquo;t nervous or afraid; but I sat up and lit my pipe and leaned against a rock.
&ldquo;What you getting up so soon for, Sam?&rdquo; asked Bill.
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Oh, I got a kind of a pain in my shoulder. I thought sitting up would rest
it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar!&rdquo; says Bill. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid. You was to be burned at sunrise, and you was
afraid he&rsquo;d do it. And he would, too, if he could find a match. Ain&rsquo;t it awful, Sam? Do you
think anybody will pay out money to get a little imp like that back home?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;A rowdy kid like that is just the kind that parents dote on. Now, you and
the Chief get up and cook breakfast, while I go up on the top of this mountain and
reconnoitre.&rdquo;
I went up on the peak of the little mountain and ran my eye over the contiguous vicinity.
Over toward Summit I expected to see the sturdy yeomanry of the village armed with
scythes and pitchforks beating the countryside for the dastardly kidnappers. But what I saw
was a peaceful landscape dotted with one man ploughing with a dun mule. Nobody was
dragging the creek; no couriers dashed hither and yon, bringing tidings of no news to the
distracted parents. There was a sylvan attitude of somnolent sleepiness pervading that
section of the external outward surface of Alabama that lay exposed to my view. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;
says I to myself, &ldquo;it has not yet been discovered that the wolves have home away the tender
lambkin from the fold. Heaven help the wolves!&rdquo; says I, and I went down the mountain to
breakfast.
When I got to the cave I found Bill backed up against the side of it, breathing hard, and
the boy threatening to smash him with a rock half as big as a cocoanut.
&ldquo;He put a red-hot boiled potato down my back,&rdquo; explained Bill, &ldquo;and the mashed it with
his foot; and I boxed his ears. Have you got a gun about you, Sam?
I took the rock away from the boy and kind of patched up the argument. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you,&rdquo;
says the kid to Bill. &ldquo;No man ever yet struck the Red Chief but what he got paid for it. You
better beware!&rdquo;
After breakfast the kid takes a piece of leather with strings wrapped around it out of his
pocket and goes outside the cave unwinding it.&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he up to now?&rdquo; says Bill, anxiously. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll run away, do you,
Sam?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No fear of it,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t seem to be much of a home body. But we&rsquo;ve got to fix
up some plan about the ransom. There don&rsquo;t seem to be much excitement around Summit
on account of his disappearance; but maybe they haven&rsquo;t realized yet that he&rsquo;s gone. His
folks may think he&rsquo;s spending the night with Aunt Jane or one of the neighbours. Anyhow,
he&rsquo;ll be missed to-day. To-night we must get a message to his father demanding the two
thousand dollars for his return.&rdquo;
Just then we heard a kind Of war-whoop, such as David might have emitted when he
knocked out the champion Goliath. It was a sling that Red Chief had pulled out of his pocket,
and he was whirling it around his head.
I dodged, and heard a heavy thud and a kind of a sigh from Bill, like a horse gives out
when you take his saddle off. A niggerhead rock the size of an egg had caught Bill just behind
his left ear. He loosened himself all over and fell in the fire across the frying pan of hot water
for washing the dishes. I dragged him out and poured cold water on his head for half an
hour.
By and by, Bill sits up and feels behind his ear and says: &ldquo;Sam, do you know who my
favourite Biblical character is?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come to your senses presently.&rdquo;
&ldquo;King Herod,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go away and leave me here alone, will you, Sam?&rdquo;
I went out and caught that boy and shook him until his freckles rattled.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t behave,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you straight home. Now, are you going to be good,
or not?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I was only funning,&rdquo; says he sullenly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt Old Hank. But what did he
hit me for? &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll behave, Snake-eye, if you won&rsquo;t send me home, and if you&rsquo;ll let me play the
Black Scout to-day.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the game,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you and Mr. Bill to decide. He&rsquo;s your
playmate for the day. I&rsquo;m going away for a while, on business. Now, you come in and make
friends with him and say you are sorry for hurting him, or home you go, at once.&rdquo;
I made him and Bill shake hands, and then I took Bill aside and told him I was going to
Poplar Cove, a little village three miles from the cave, and find out what I could about how
the kidnapping had been regarded in Summit. Also, I thought it best to send a peremptoryletter to old man Dorset that day, demanding the ransom and dictating how it should be
paid.
&ldquo;You know, Sam,&rdquo; says Bill, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stood by you without batting an eye in earthquakes,
fire and flood &ndash; in poker games, dynamite outrages, police raids, train robberies and
cyclones. I never lost my nerve yet till we kidnapped that two-legged skyrocket of a kid. He&rsquo;s
got me going. You won&rsquo;t leave me long with him, will you, Sam?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back some time this afternoon,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;You must keep the boy amused and
quiet till I return. And now we&rsquo;ll write the letter to old Dorset.&rdquo;
Bill and I got paper and pencil and worked on the letter while Red Chief, with a blanket
wrapped around him, strutted up and down, guarding the mouth of the cave. Bill begged me
tearfully to make the ransom fifteen hundred dollars instead of two thousand. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t
attempting,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to decry the celebrated moral aspect of parental affection, but we&rsquo;re
dealing with humans, and it ain&rsquo;t human for anybody to give up two thousand dollars for
that forty-pound chunk of freckled wildcat. I&rsquo;m willing to take a chance at fifteen hundred
dollars. You can charge the difference up to me.&rdquo;
So, to relieve Bill, I acceded, and we collaborated a letter that ran this way:
Ebenezer Dorset, Esq.:
We have your boy concealed in a place far from Summit. It is useless for you or the
most skilful detectives to attempt to find him. Absolutely, the only terms on which you can
have him restored to you are these: We demand fifteen hundred dollars in large bills for his
return; the money to be left at midnight to-night at the same spot and in the same box as
your reply &ndash; as hereinafter described. If you agree to these terms, send your answer in
writing by a solitary messenger to-night at half-past eight o&rsquo;clock. After crossing Owl Creek,
on the road to Poplar Cove, there are three large trees about a hundred yards apart, close to
the fence of the wheat field on the right-hand side. At the bottom of the fence-post,
opposite the third tree, will be found a small pasteboard box. The messenger will place the
answer in this box and return immediately to Summit.
If you attempt any treachery or fail to comply with our demand as stated, you will
never see your boy again.
If you pay the money as demanded, he will be returned to you safe and well within
three hours. These terms are final, and if you do not accede to them no further
communication will be attempted.
TWO DESPERATE MEN.I addressed this letter to Dorset, and put it in my pocket. As I was about to start, the kid
comes up to me and says:
&ldquo;Aw, Snake-eye, you said I could play the Black Scout while you was gone.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Play it, of course,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Mr. Bill will play with you. What kind of a game is it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Black Scout,&rdquo; says Red Chief, &ldquo;and I have to ride to the stockade to warn the
settlers that the Indians are coming. I&rsquo;m tired of playing Indian myself. I want to be the Black
Scout.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;It sounds harmless to me. I guess Mr. Bill will help you foil the pesky
savages.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; asks Bill, looking at the kid suspiciously.
&ldquo;You are the hoss,&rdquo; says Black Scout. &ldquo;Get down on your hands and knees. How can I
ride to the stockade without a hoss?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better keep him interested,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;till we get the scheme going. Loosen up.&rdquo;
Bill gets down on his all fours, and a look comes in his eye like a rabbit&rsquo;s when you catch
it in a trap.
&ldquo;How far is it to the stockade, kid?&rdquo; he asks, in a husky manner of voice.
&ldquo;Ninety miles,&rdquo; says the Black Scout. &ldquo;And you have to hump yourself to get there on
time. Whoa, now!&rdquo;
The Black Scout jumps on Bill&rsquo;s back and digs his heels in his side.
&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; says Bill, &ldquo;hurry back, Sam, as soon as you can. I wish we hadn&rsquo;t
made the ransom more than a thousand. Say, you quit kicking me or I&rsquo;ll get up and warm
you good.&rdquo;
I walked over to Poplar Cove and sat around the post-office and store, talking with the
chawbacons that came in to trade. One whiskerando says that he hears Summit is all upset
on account of Elder Ebenezer Dorset&rsquo;s boy having been lost or stolen. That was all I wanted
to know. I bought some smoking tobacco, referred casually to the price of black-eyed peas,
posted my letter surreptitiously and came away. The postmaster said the mail-carrier would
come by in an hour to take the mail on to Summit.
When I got back to the cave Bill and the boy were not to be found. I explored the
vicinity of the cave, and risked a yodel or two, but there was no response.So I lighted my pipe and sat down on a mossy bank to await developments.
In about half an hour I heard the bushes rustle, and Bill wabbled out into the little glade
in front of the cave. Behind him was the kid, stepping softly like a scout, with a broad grin on
his face. Bill stopped, took off his hat and wiped his face with a red handkerchief. The kid
stopped about eight feet behind him.
&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; says Bill, &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m a renegade, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;m a
grown person with masculine proclivities and habits of self-defense, but there is a time
when all systems of egotism and predominance fail. The boy is gone. I have sent him home.
All is off. There was martyrs in old times,&rdquo; goes on Bill, &ldquo;that suffered death rather than give
up the particular graft they enjoyed. None of &lsquo;em ever was subjugated to such supernatural
tortures as I have been. I tried to be faithful to our articles of depredation; but there came a
limit.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, Bill?&rdquo; I asks him.
&ldquo;I was rode,&rdquo; says Bill, &ldquo;the ninety miles to the stockade, not barring an inch. Then,
when the settlers was rescued, I was given oats. Sand ain&rsquo;t a palatable substitute. And then,
for an hour I had to try to explain to him why there was nothin&rsquo; in holes, how a road can run
both ways and what makes the grass green. I tell you, Sam, a human can only stand so much.
I takes him by the neck of his clothes and drags him down the mountain. On the way he kicks
my legs black-and-blue from the knees down; and I&rsquo;ve got to have two or three bites on my
thumb and hand cauterized.
&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s gone&rdquo; &ndash; continues Bill &ndash; &ldquo;gone home. I showed him the road to Summit and
kicked him about eight feet nearer there at one kick. I&rsquo;m sorry we lose the ransom; but it
was either that or Bill Driscoll to the madhouse.&rdquo;
Bill is puffing and blowing, but there is a look of ineffable peace and growing content
on his rose-pink features.
&ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t any heart disease in your family, is there?
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says Bill, &ldquo;nothing chronic except malaria and accidents. Why?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then you might turn around,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and have a took behind you.&rdquo;
Bill turns and sees the boy, and loses his complexion and sits down plump on the round
and begins to pluck aimlessly at grass and little sticks. For an hour I was afraid for his mind.
And then I told him that my scheme was to put the whole job through immediately and that
we would get the ransom and be off with it by midnight if old Dorset fell in with ourproposition. So Bill braced up enough to give the kid a weak sort of a smile and a promise to
play the Russian in a Japanese war with him is soon as he felt a little better.
I had a scheme for collecting that ransom without danger of being caught by
counterplots that ought to commend itself to professional kidnappers. The tree under which
the answer was to be left &ndash; and the money later on &ndash; was close to the road fence with big,
bare fields on all sides. If a gang of constables should be watching for any one to come for
the note they could see him a long way off crossing the fields or in the road. But no, sirree!
At half-past eight I was up in that tree as well hidden as a tree toad, waiting for the
messenger to arrive.
Exactly on time, a half-grown boy rides up the road on a bicycle, locates the pasteboard
box at the foot of the fence-post, slips a folded piece of paper into it and pedals away again
back toward Summit.
I waited an hour and then concluded the thing was square. I slid down the tree, got the
note, slipped along the fence till I struck the woods, and was back at the cave in another half
an hour. I opened the note, got near the lantern and read it to Bill. It was written with a pen
in a crabbed hand, and the sum and substance of it was this:
Two Desperate Men.
Gentlemen: I received your letter to-day by post, in regard to the ransom you ask for
the return of my son. I think you are a little high in your demands, and I hereby make you a
counter-proposition, which I am inclined to believe you will accept. You bring Johnny home
and pay me two hundred and fifty dollars in cash, and I agree to take him off your hands.
You had better come at night, for the neighbours believe he is lost, and I couldn&rsquo;t be
responsible for what they would do to anybody they saw bringing him back.
Very respectfully,
EBENEZER DORSET.
&ldquo;Great pirates of Penzance!&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;of all the impudent &ndash; &ldquo;
But I glanced at Bill, and hesitated. He had the most appealing look in his eyes I ever
saw on the face of a dumb or a talking brute.
&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s two hundred and fifty dollars, after all? We&rsquo;ve got the money.
One more night of this kid will send me to a bed in Bedlam. Besides being a thorough
gentleman, I think Mr. Dorset is a spendthrift for making us such a liberal offer. You ain&rsquo;t
going to let the chance go, are you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tell you the truth, Bill,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;this little he ewe lamb has somewhat got on my nerves
too. We&rsquo;ll take him home, pay the ransom and make our get-away.&ldquo;We took him home that night. We got him to go by telling him that his father had
bought a silver-mounted rifle and a pair of moccasins for him, and we were going to hunt
bears the next day.
It was just twelve o&rsquo;clock when we knocked at Ebenezer s front door. Just at the
moment when I should have been abstracting the fifteen hundred dollars from the box
under the tree, according to the original proposition, Bill was counting out two hundred and
fifty dollars into Dorset&rsquo;s hand.
When the kid found out we were going to leave him at home he started up a howl like a
calliope and fastened himself as tight as a leech to Bill&rsquo;s leg. His father peeled him away
gradually, like a porous plaster.
&ldquo;How long can you hold him?&rdquo; asks Bill.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as strong as I used to be,&rdquo; says old Dorset, &ldquo;but I think I can promise you ten
minutes.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; says Bill. &ldquo;In ten minutes I shall cross the Central, Southern and Middle
Western States, and be legging it trippingly for the Canadian border.&rdquo;
And, as dark as it was, and as fat as Bill was, and as good a runner as I am, he was a
good mile and a half out of Summit before I could catch up with him.
The Red Roses of Tonia （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>A trestle burned down on the International Railroad. The south- bound from San
Antonio was cut off for the next forty-eight hours. On that train was Tonia Weaver&rsquo;s Easter
hat.
Espirition, the Mexican, who had been sent forty miles in a buckboard from the
Espinosa Ranch to fetch it, returned with a shrugging shoulder and hands empty except for a
cigarette. At the small station, Nopal, he had learned of the delayed train and, having no
commands to wait, turned his ponies toward the ranch again.
Now, if one supposes that Easter, the Goddess of Spring, cares any more for the
after-church parade on Fifth Avenue than she does for her loyal outfit of subjects that
assemble at the meeting-house at Cactus, Tex., a mistake has been made. The wives and
daughters of the ranchmen of the Frio country put forth Easter blossoms of new hats and
gowns as faithfully as is done anywhere, and the Southwest is, for one day, a mingling ofprickly pear, Paris, and paradise. And now it was Good Friday, and Tonia Weaver&rsquo;s Easter hat
blushed unseen in the desert air of an impotent express car, beyond the burned trestle. On
Saturday noon the Rogers girls, from the Shoestring Ranch, and Ella Reeves, from the
Anchor-O, and Mrs. Bennet and Ida, from Green Valley, would convene at the Espinosa and
pick up Tonia. With their Easter hats and frocks carefully wrapped and bundled against the
dust, the fair aggregation would then merrily jog the ten miles to Cactus, where on the
morrow they would array themselves, subjugate man, do homage to Easter, and cause
jealous agitation among the lilies of the field.
Tonia sat on the steps of the Espinosa ranch house flicking gloomily with a quirt at a
tuft of curly mesquite. She displayed a frown and a contumelious lip, and endeavored to
radiate an aura of disagreeableness and tragedy.
&ldquo;I hate railroads,&rdquo; she announced positively. &ldquo;And men. Men pretend to run them. Can
you give any excuse why a trestle should burn? Ida Bennet&rsquo;s hat is to be trimmed with
violets. I shall not go one step toward Cactus without a new hat. If I were a man I would get
one.&rdquo;
Two men listened uneasily to this disparagement of their kind. One was Wells Pearson,
foreman of the Mucho Calor cattle ranch. The other was Thompson Burrows, the prosperous
sheepman from the Quintana Valley. Both thought Tonia Weaver adorable, especially when
she railed at railroads and menaced men. Either would have given up his epidermis to make
for her an Easter hat more cheerfully than the ostrich gives up his tip or the aigrette lays
down its life. Neither possessed the ingenuity to conceive a means of supplying the sad
deficiency against the coming Sabbath. Pearson&rsquo;s deep brown face and sunburned light hair
gave him the appearance of a schoolboy seized by one of youth&rsquo;s profound and insolvable
melancholies. Tonia&rsquo;s plight grieved him through and through. Thompson Burrows was the
more skilled and pliable. He hailed from somewhere in the East originally; and he wore
neckties and shoes, and was made dumb by woman&rsquo;s presence.
&ldquo;The big water-hole on Sandy Creek,&rdquo; said Pearson, scarcely hoping to make a hit, &ldquo;was
filled up by that last rain.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh! Was it?&rdquo; said Tonia sharply. &ldquo;Thank you for the information. I suppose a new hat is
nothing to you, Mr. Pearson. I suppose you think a woman ought to wear an old Stetson five
years without a change, as you do. If your old water-hole could have put out the fire on that
trestle you might have some reason to talk about it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am deeply sorry,&rdquo; said Burrows, warned by Pearson&rsquo;s fate, &ldquo;that you failed to receive
your hat, Miss Weaver&ndash;deeply sorry, indeed. If there was anything I could do&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; interrupted Tonia, with sweet sarcasm. &ldquo;If there was anything you could
do, you&rsquo;d be doing it, of course. There isn&rsquo;t.&ldquo;Tonia paused. A sudden sparkle of hope had come into her eye. Her frown smoothed
away. She had an inspiration.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a store over at Lone Elm Crossing on the Nueces,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that keeps hats.
Eva Rogers got hers there. She said it was the latest style. It might have some left. But it&rsquo;s
twenty-eight miles to Lone Elm.&rdquo;
The spurs of two men who hastily arose jingled; and Tonia almost smiled. The Knights,
then, were not all turned to dust; nor were their rowels rust.
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Tonia, looking thoughtfully at a white gulf cloud sailing across the
cerulean dome, &ldquo;nobody could ride to Lone Elm and back by the time the girls call by for me
to-morrow. So, I reckon I&rsquo;ll have to stay at home this Easter Sunday.&rdquo;
And then she smiled.
&ldquo;Well, Miss Tonia,&rdquo; said Pearson, reaching for his hat, as guileful as a sleeping babe. &ldquo;I
reckon I&rsquo;ll be trotting along back to Mucho Calor. There&rsquo;s some cutting out to be done on Dry
Branch first thing in the morning; and me and Road Runner has got to be on hand. It&rsquo;s too
bad your hat got sidetracked. Maybe they&rsquo;ll get that trestle mended yet in time for Easter.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I must be riding, too, Miss Tonia,&rdquo; announced Burrows, looking at his watch. &ldquo;I declare,
it&rsquo;s nearly five o&rsquo;clock! I must be out at my lambing camp in time to help pen those crazy
ewes.&rdquo;
Tonia&rsquo;s suitors seemed to have been smitten with a need for haste. They bade her a
ceremonious farewell, and then shook each other&rsquo;s hands with the elaborate and solemn
courtesy of the Southwesterner.
&ldquo;Hope I&rsquo;ll see you again soon, Mr. Pearson,&rdquo; said Burrows.
&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; said the cowman, with the serious face of one whose friend goes upon a
whaling voyage. &ldquo;Be gratified to see you ride over to Mucho Calor any time you strike that
section of the range.&rdquo;
Pearson mounted Road Runner, the soundest cow-pony on the Frio, and let him pitch
for a minute, as he always did on being mounted, even at the end of a day&rsquo;s travel.
&ldquo;What kind of a hat was that, Miss Tonia,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;that you ordered from San
Antone? I can&rsquo;t help but be sorry about that hat.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A straw,&rdquo; said Tonia; &ldquo;the latest shape, of course; trimmed with red roses. That&rsquo;s what I
like&ndash;red roses.&ldquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no color more becoming to your complexion and hair,&rdquo; said Burrows,
admiringly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I like,&rdquo; said Tonia. &ldquo;And of all the flowers, give me red roses. Keep all the pinks
and blues for yourself. But what&rsquo;s the use, when trestles burn and leave you without
anything? It&rsquo;ll be a dry old Easter for me!&rdquo;
Pearson took off his hat and drove Road Bunner at a gallop into the chaparral east of
the Espinosa ranch house.
As his stirrups rattled against the brush Burrows&rsquo;s long-legged sorrel struck out down
the narrow stretch of open prairie to the southwest.
Tonia hung up her quirt and went into the sitting-room.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty sorry, daughter, that you didn&rsquo;t get your hat,&rdquo; said her mother.
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry, mother,&rdquo; said Tonia, coolly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a new hat, all right, in time
to-morrow.&rdquo;
When Burrows reached the end of the strip of prairie he pulled his sorrel to the right
and let him pick his way daintily across a sacuista flat through which ran the ragged, dry bed
of an arroyo. Then up a gravelly hill, matted with bush, the hoarse scrambled, and at length
emerged, with a snort of satisfaction into a stretch of high, level prairie, grassy and dotted
with the lighter green of mesquites in their fresh spring foliage. Always to the right Burrows
bore, until in a little while he struck the old Indian trail that followed the Nueces southward,
and that passed, twenty-eight miles to the southeast, through Lone Elm.
Here Burrows urged the sorrel into a steady lope. As he settled himself in the saddle for
a long ride he heard the drumming of hoofs, the hollow &ldquo;thwack&rdquo; of chaparral against
wooden stirrups, the whoop of a Comanche; and Wells Pearson burst out of the brush at the
right of the trail like a precocious yellow chick from a dark green Easter egg.
Except in the presence of awing femininity melancholy found no place in Pearson&rsquo;s
bosom. In Tonia&rsquo;s presence his voice was as soft as a summer bullfrog&rsquo;s in his reedy nest.
Now, at his gleesome yawp, rabbits, a mile away, ducked their ears, and sensitive plants
closed their fearful fronds.
&ldquo;Moved your lambing camp pretty far from the ranch, haven&rsquo;t you, neighbor?&rdquo; asked
Pearson, as Road Runner fell in at the sorrel&rsquo;s side.
&ldquo;Twenty-eight miles,&rdquo; said Burrows, looking a little grim. Pearson&rsquo;s laugh woke an owl
one hour too early in his water-elm on the river bank, half a mile away.&ldquo;All right for you, sheepman. I like an open game, myself. We&rsquo;re two locoed he-milliners
hat-hunting in the wilderness. I notify you. Burr, to mind your corrals. We&rsquo;ve got an even
start, and the one that gets the headgear will stand some higher at the Espinosa.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a good pony,&rdquo; said Burrows, eyeing Road Runner&rsquo;s barrel- like body and
tapering legs that moved as regularly as the pistonrod of an engine. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a race, of course;
but you&rsquo;re too much of a horseman to whoop it up this soon. Say we travel together till we
get to the home stretch.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your company,&rdquo; agreed Pearson, &ldquo;and I admire your sense. If there&rsquo;s hats at Lone
Elm, one of &lsquo;em shall set on Miss Tonia&rsquo;s brow to-morrow, and you won&rsquo;t be at the crowning.
I ain&rsquo;t bragging, Burr, but that sorrel of yours is weak in the fore-legs.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My horse against yours,&rdquo; offered Burrows, &ldquo;that Miss Tonia wears the hat I take her to
Cactus to-morrow.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you up,&rdquo; shouted Pearson. &ldquo;But oh, it&rsquo;s just like horse- stealing for me! I can
use that sorrel for a lady&rsquo;s animal when&ndash; when somebody comes over to Mucho Calor,
and&ndash;&rdquo;
Burrows&rsquo; dark face glowered so suddenly that the cowman broke off his sentence. But
Pearson could never feel any pressure for long.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this Easter business about, Burr?&rdquo; he asked, cheerfully. &ldquo;Why do the women
folks have to have new hats by the almanac or bust all cinches trying to get &lsquo;em?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a seasonable statute out of the testaments,&rdquo; explained Burrows. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ordered by
the Pope or somebody. And it has something to do with the Zodiac I don&rsquo;t know exactly, but
I think it was invented by the Egyptians.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an all-right jubilee if the heathens did put their brand on it,&rdquo; said Pearson; &ldquo;or else
Tonia wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with it. And they pull it off at church, too. Suppose there
ain&rsquo;t but one hat in the Lone Elm store, Burr!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Burrows, darkly, &ldquo;the best man of us&rsquo;ll take it back to the Espinosa.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, man!&rdquo; cried Pearson, throwing his hat high and catching it again, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing
like you come off the sheep ranges before. You talk good and collateral to the occasion. And
if there&rsquo;s more than one?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Burrows, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll pick our choice and one of us&rsquo;ll get back first with his and
the other won&rsquo;t.&ldquo;&ldquo;There never was two souls,&rdquo; proclaimed Pearson to the stars, &ldquo;that beat more like one
heart than yourn and mine. Me and you might be riding on a unicorn and thinking out of the
same piece of mind.&rdquo;
At a little past midnight the riders loped into Lone Elm. The half a hundred houses of
the big village were dark. On its only street the big wooden store stood barred and
shuttered.
In a few moments the horses were fastened and Pearson was pounding cheerfully on
the door of old Sutton, the storekeeper.
The barrel of a Winchester came through a cranny of a solid window shutter followed
by a short inquiry.
&ldquo;Wells Pearson, of the Mucho Calor, and Burrows, of Green Valley,&rdquo; was the response.
&ldquo;We want to buy some goods in the store. Sorry to wake you up but we must have &lsquo;em.
Come on out, Vncle Tommy, and get a move on you.&rdquo;
Uncle Tommy was slow, but at length they got him behind his counter with a kerosene
lamp lit, and told him of their dire need.
&ldquo;Easter hats?&rdquo; said Uncle Tommy, sleepily. &ldquo;Why, yes, I believe I have got just a couple
left. I only ordered a dozen this spring. I&rsquo;ll show &lsquo;em to you.&rdquo;
Now, Uncle Tommy Sutton was a merchant, half asleep or awake. In dusty pasteboard
boxes under the counter he had two left-over spring hats. But, alas! for his commercial
probity on that early Saturday morn&ndash;they were hats of two springs ago, and a woman&rsquo;s eye
would have detected the fraud at half a glance. But to the unintelligent gaze of the
cowpuncher and the sheepman they seemed fresh from the mint of contemporaneous April.
The hats were of a variety once known as &ldquo;cart-wheels.&rdquo; They were of stiff straw,
colored red, and flat brimmed. Both were exactly alike, and trimmed lavishly around their
crowns with full blown, immaculate, artificial white roses.
&ldquo;That all you got, Uncle Tommy?&rdquo; said Pearson. &ldquo;All right. Not much choice here, Burr.
Take your pick.&rdquo;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the latest styles&rdquo; lied Uncle Tommy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d see &lsquo;em on Fifth Avenue, if you was
in New York.&rdquo;
Uncle Tommy wrapped and tied each hat in two yards of dark calico for a protection.
One Pearson tied carefully to his calfskin saddle- thongs; and the other became part of Road
Runner&rsquo;s burden. They shouted thanks and farewells to Uncle Tommy, and cantered back
into the night on the home stretch.The horsemen jockeyed with all their skill. They rode more slowly on their way back.
The few words they spoke were not unfriendly. Burrows had a Winchester under his left leg
slung over his saddle horn. Pearson had a six shooter belted around him. Thus men rode in
the Frio country.
At half-past seven in the morning they rode to the top of a hill and saw the Espinosa
Ranch, a white spot under a dark patch of live-oaks, five miles away.
The sight roused Pearson from his drooping pose in the saddle. He knew what Road
Runner could do. The sorrel was lathered, and stumbling frequently; Road Runner was
pegging away like a donkey engine.
Pearson turned toward the sheepman and laughed. &ldquo;Good-bye, Burr,&rdquo; he cried, with a
wave of his hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a race now. We&rsquo;re on the home stretch.&rdquo;
He pressed Road Runner with his knees and leaned toward the Espinosa. Road Runner
struck into a gallop, with tossing head and snorting nostrils, as if he were fresh from a month
in pasture.
Pearson rode twenty yards and heard the unmistakable sound of a Winchester lever
throwing a cartridge into the barrel. He dropped flat along his horse&rsquo;s back before the crack
of the rifle reached his ears.
It is possible that Burrows intended only to disable the horse&ndash; he was a good enough
shot to do that without endangering his rider. But as Pearson stooped the ball went through
his shoulder and then through Road Runner&rsquo;s neck. The horse fell and the cowman pitched
over his head into the hard road, and neither of them tried to move.
Burrows rode on without stopping.
In two hours Pearson opened his eyes and took inventory. He managed to get to his
feet and staggered back to where Road Runner was lying.
Road Runner was lying there, but he appeared to be comfortable. Pearson examined
him and found that the bullet had &ldquo;creased&rdquo; him. He had been knocked out temporarily, but
not seriously hurt. But he was tired, and he lay there on Miss Tonia&rsquo;s hat and ate leaves from
a mesquite branch that obligingly hung over the road.
Pearson made the horse get up. The Easter hat, loosed from the saddle-thongs, lay
there in its calico wrappings, a shapeless thing from its sojourn beneath the solid carcass of
Road Runner. Then Pearson fainted and fell head long upon the poor hat again, crumpling it
under his wounded shoulders.It is hard to kill a cowpuncher. In half an hour he revived&ndash;long enough for a woman to
have fainted twice and tried ice-cream for a restorer. He got up carefully and found Road
Runner who was busy with the near-by grass. He tied the unfortunate hat to the saddle
again, and managed to get himself there, too, after many failures.
At noon a gay and fluttering company waited in front of the Espinosa Ranch. The Rogers
girls were there in their new buckboard, and the Anchor-O outfit and the Green Valley
folks&ndash;mostly women. And each and every one wore her new Easter hat, even upon the
lonely prairies, for they greatly desired to shine forth and do honor to the coming festival.
At the gate stood Tonia. with undisguised tears upon her cheeks. In her hand she held
Burrow&rsquo;s Lone Elm hat, and it was at its white roses, hated by her, that she wept. For her
friends were telling her, with the ecstatic joy of true friends, that cart-wheels could not be
worn, being three seasons passed into oblivion.
&ldquo;Put on your old hat and come, Tonia,&rdquo; they urged.
&ldquo;For Easter Sunday?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll die first.&rdquo; And wept again.
The hats of the fortunate ones were curved and twisted into the style of spring&rsquo;s latest
proclamation.
A strange being rode out of the brush among them, and there sat his horse languidly.
He was stained and disfigured with the green of the grass and the limestone of rocky roads.
&ldquo;Hallo, Pearson,&rdquo; said Daddy Weaver. &ldquo;Look like you&rsquo;ve been breaking a mustang.
What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve got tied to your saddle&ndash;a pig in a poke?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, come on, Tonia, if you&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; said Betty Rogers. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t wait any longer.
We&rsquo;ve saved a seat in the buckboard for you. Never mind the hat. That lovely muslin you&rsquo;ve
got on looks sweet enough with any old hat.&rdquo;
Pearson was slowly untying the queer thing on his saddle. Tonia looked at him with a
sudden hope. Pearson was a man who created hope. He got the thing loose and handed it to
her. Her quick fingers tore at the strings.
&ldquo;Best I could do,&rdquo; said Pearson slowly. &ldquo;What Road Runner and me done to it will be
about all it needs.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, oh! it&rsquo;s just the right shape,&rdquo; shrieked Tonia. &ldquo;And red roses! Wait till I try it on!&rdquo;
She flew in to the glass, and out again, beaming, radiating, blossomed.
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t red become her?&rdquo; chanted the girls in recitative. &ldquo;Hurry up, Tonia!&ldquo;Tonia stopped for a moment by the side of Road Runner.
&ldquo;Thank you, thank you, Wells,&rdquo; she said, happily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just what I wanted. Won&rsquo;t you
come over to Cactus to-morrow and go to church with me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;If I can,&rdquo; said Pearson. He was looking curiously at her hat, and then he grinned
weakly.
Tonia flew into the buckboard like a bird. The vehicles sped away for Cactus.
&ldquo;What have you been doing, Pearson?&rdquo; asked Daddy Weaver. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t looking so well
as common.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Pearson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been painting flowers. Them roses was white when I left Lone
Elm. Help me down, Daddy Weaver, for I haven&rsquo;t got any more paint to spare.&rdquo;
The Reformation of Calliope （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Calliope Catesby was in his humours again. Ennui was upon him. This goodly
promontory, the earth&ndash;particularly that portion of it known as Quicksand&ndash;was to him no
more than a pestilent congregation of vapours. Overtaken by the megrims, the philosopher
may seek relief in soliloquy; my lady find solace in tears; the flaccid Easterner scold at the
millinery bills of his women folk. Such recourse was insufficient to the denizens of Quicksand.
Calliope, especially, was wont to express his ennui according to his lights.
Over night Calliope had hung out signals of approaching low spirits. He had kicked his
own dog on the porch of the Occidental Hotel, and refused to apologise. He had become
capricious and fault-finding in conversation. While strolling about he reached often for twigs
of mesquite and chewed the leaves fiercely. That was always an ominous act. Another
symptom alarming to those who were familiar with the different stages of his doldrums was
his increasing politeness and a tendency to use formal phrases. A husky softness succeeded
the usual penetrating drawl in his tones. A dangerous courtesy marked his manners. Later,
his smile became crooked, the left side of his mouth slanting upward, and Quicksand got
ready to stand from under.
At this stage Calliope generally began to drink. Finally, about midnight, he was seen
going homeward, saluting those whom he met with exaggerated but inoffensive courtesy.
Not yet was Calliope&rsquo;s melancholy at the danger point. He would seat himself at the window
of the room he occupied over Silvester&rsquo;s tonsorial parlours and there chant lugubrious andtuneless ballads until morning, accompanying the noises by appropriate maltreatment of a
jangling guitar. More magnanimous than Nero, he would thus give musical warning of the
forthcoming municipal upheaval that Quicksand was scheduled to endure.
A quiet, amiable man was Calliope Catesby at other times&ndash;quiet to indolence, and
amiable to worthlessness. At best he was a loafer and a nuisance; at worst he was the Terror
of Quicksand. His ostensible occupation was something subordinate in the real estate line;
he drove the beguiled Easterner in buckboards out to look over lots and ranch property.
Originally he came from one of the Gulf States, his lank six feet, slurring rhythm of speech,
and sectional idioms giving evidence of his birthplace.
And yet, after taking on Western adjustments, this languid pine-box whittler, cracker
barrel hugger, shady corner lounger of the cotton fields and sumac hills of the South became
famed as a bad man among men who had made a life-long study of the art of truculence.
At nine the next morning Calliope was fit. Inspired by his own barbarous melodies and
the contents of his jug, he was ready primed to gather fresh laurels from the diffident brow
of Quicksand. Encircled and criss-crossed with cartridge belts, abundantly garnished with
revolvers, and copiously drunk, he poured forth into Quicksand&rsquo;s main street. Too chivalrous
to surprise and capture a town by silent sortie, he paused at the nearest corner and emitted
his slogan&ndash;that fearful, brassy yell, so reminiscent of the steam piano, that had gained for
him the classic appellation that had superseded his own baptismal name. Following close
upon his vociferation came three shots from his forty-five by way of limbering up the guns
and testing his aim. A yellow dog, the personal property of Colonel Swazey, the proprietor of
the Occidental, fell feet upward in the dust with one farewell yelp. A Mexican who was
crossing the street from the Blue Front grocery carrying in his hand a bottle of kerosene, was
stimulated to a sudden and admirable burst of speed, still grasping the neck of the shattered
bottle. The new gilt weather-cock on Judge Riley&rsquo;s lemon and ultramarine two-story
residence shivered, flapped, and hung by a splinter, the sport of the wanton breezes.
The artillery was in trim. Calliope&rsquo;s hand was steady. The high, calm ecstasy of habitual
battle was upon him, though slightly embittered by the sadness of Alexander in that his
conquests were limited to the small world of Quicksand.
Down the street went Calliope, shooting right and left. Glass fell like hail; dogs vamosed;
chickens flew, squawking; feminine voices shrieked concernedly to youngsters at large. The
din was perforated at intervals by the staccato of the Terror&rsquo;s guns, and was drowned
periodically by the brazen screech that Quicksand knew so well. The occasions of Calliope&rsquo;s
low spirits were legal holidays in Quicksand. All along the main street in advance of his
coming clerks were putting up shutters and closing doors. Business would languish for a
space. The right of way was Calliope&rsquo;s, and as he advanced, observing the dearth of
opposition and the few opportunities for distraction, his ennui perceptibly increased.But some four squares farther down lively preparations were being made to minister to
Mr. Catesby&rsquo;s love for interchange of compliments and repartee. On the previous night
numerous messengers had hastened to advise Buck Patterson, the city marshal, of Calliope&rsquo;s
impending eruption. The patience of that official, often strained in extending leniency
toward the disturber&rsquo;s misdeeds, had been overtaxed. In Quicksand some indulgence was
accorded the natural ebullition of human nature. Providing that the lives of the more useful
citizens were not recklessly squandered, or too much property needlessly laid waste, the
community sentiment was against a too strict enforcement of the law. But Calliope had
raised the limit. His outbursts had been too frequent and too violent to come within the
classification of a normal and sanitary relaxation of spirit.
Buck Patterson had been expecting and awaiting in his little ten-by- twelve frame office
that preliminary yell announcing that Calliope was feeling blue. When the signal came the
city marshal rose to his feet and buckled on his guns. Two deputy sheriffs and three citizens
who had proven the edible qualities of fire also stood up, ready to bandy with Calliope&rsquo;s
leaden jocularities.
&ldquo;Gather that fellow in,&rdquo; said Buck Patterson, setting forth the lines of the campaign.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have no talk, but shoot as soon as you can get a show. Keep behind cover and bring
him down. He&rsquo;s a nogood &lsquo;un. It&rsquo;s up to Calliope to turn up his toes this time, I reckon. Go to
him all spraddled out, boys. And don&rsquo;t git too reckless, for what Calliope shoots at he hits.&rdquo;
Buck Patterson, tall, muscular, and solemn-faced, with his bright &ldquo;City Marshal&rdquo; badge
shining on the breast of his blue flannel shirt, gave his posse directions for the onslaught
upon Calliope. The plan was to accomplish the downfall of the Quicksand Terror without loss
to the attacking party, if possible.
The splenetic Calliope, unconscious of retributive plots, was steaming down the
channel, cannonading on either side, when he suddenly became aware of breakers ahead.
The city marshal and one of the deputies rose up behind some dry-goods boxes half a
square to the front and opened fire. At the same time the rest of the posse, divided, shelled
him from two side streets up which they were cautiously manoeuvring from a well-executed
detour.
The first volley broke the lock of one of Calliope&rsquo;s guns, cut a neat underbit in his right
ear, and exploded a cartridge in his crossbelt, scorching his ribs as it burst. Feeling braced up
by this unexpected tonic to his spiritual depression, Calliope executed a fortissimo note from
his upper register, and returned the fire like an echo. The upholders of the law dodged at his
flash, but a trifle too late to save one of the deputies a bullet just above the elbow, and the
marshal a bleeding cheek from a splinter that a ball tore from the box he had ducked
behind.
And now Calliope met the enemy&rsquo;s tactics in kind. Choosing with a rapid eye the street
from which the weakest and least accurate fire had come, he invaded it at a double-quick,abandoning the unprotected middle of the street. With rare cunning the opposing force in
that direction&ndash;one of the deputies and two of the valorous volunteers&ndash; waited, concealed
by beer barrels, until Calliope had passed their retreat, and then peppered him from the rear.
In another moment they were reinforced by the marshal and his other men, and then
Calliope felt that in order to successfully prolong the delights of the controversy he must find
some means of reducing the great odds against him. His eye fell upon a structure that
seemed to hold out this promise, providing he could reach it.
Not far away was the little railroad station, its building a strong box house, ten by
twenty feet, resting upon a platform four feet above ground. Windows were in each of its
walls. Something like a fort it might become to a man thus sorely pressed by superior
numbers.
Calliope made a bold and rapid spurt for it, the marshal&rsquo;s crowd &ldquo;smoking&rdquo; him as he
ran. He reached the haven in safety, the station agent leaving the building by a window, like
a flying squirrel, as the garrison entered the door.
Patterson and his supporters halted under protection of a pile of lumber and held
consultations. In the station was an unterrified desperado who was an excellent shot and
carried an abundance of ammunition. For thirty yards on either side of the besieged was a
stretch of bare, open ground. It was a sure thing that the man who attempted to enter that
unprotected area would be stopped by one of Calliope&rsquo;s bullets.
The city marshal was resolved. He had decided that Calliope Catesby should no more
wake the echoes of Quicksand with his strident whoop. He had so announced. Officially and
personally he felt imperatively bound to put the soft pedal on that instrument of discord. It
played bad tunes.
Standing near was a hand truck used in the manipulation of small freight. It stood by a
shed full of sacked wool, a consignment from one of the sheep ranches. On this truck the
marshal and his men piled three heavy sacks of wool. Stooping low, Buck Patterson started
for Calliope&rsquo;s fort, slowly pushing this loaded truck before him for protection. The posse,
scattering broadly, stood ready to nip the besieged in case he should show himself in an
effort to repel the juggernaut of justice that was creeping upon him. Only once did Calliope
make demonstration. He fired from a window, and some tufts of wool spurted from the
marshal&rsquo;s trustworthy bulwark. The return shots from the posse pattered against the
window frame of the fort. No loss resulted on either side.
The marshal was too deeply engrossed in steering his protected battleship to be aware
of the approach of the morning train until he was within a few feet of the platform. The train
was coming up on the other side of it. It stopped only one minute at Quicksand. What an
opportunity it would offer to Calliope! He had only to step out the other door, mount the
train, and away.Abandoning his breastwork, Buck, with his gun ready, dashed up the steps and into the
room, driving upon the closed door with one heave of his weighty shoulder. The members of
the posse heard one shot fired inside, and then there was silence.</p>

<hr />

<p>At length the wounded man opened his eyes. After a blank space he again could see
and hear and feel and think. Turning his eyes about, he found himself lying on a wooden
bench. A tall man with a perplexed countenance, wearing a big badge with &ldquo;City Marshal&rdquo;
engraved upon it, stood over him. A little old woman in black, with a wrinkled face and
sparkling black eyes, was holding a wet handkerchief against one of his temples. He was
trying to get these facts fixed in his mind and connected with past events, when the old
woman began to talk.
&ldquo;There now, great, big, strong man! That bullet never tetched ye! Jest skeeted along the
side of your head and sort of paralysed ye for a spell. I&rsquo;ve heerd of sech things afore;
cun-cussion is what they names it. Abel Wadkins used to kill squirrels that way&ndash;barkin&rsquo; &lsquo;em,
Abe called it. You jest been barked, sir, and you&rsquo;ll be all right in a little bit. Feel lots better
already, don&rsquo;t ye! You just lay still a while longer and let me bathe your head. You don&rsquo;t
know me, I reckon, and &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t surprisin&rsquo; that you shouldn&rsquo;t. I come in on that train from
Alabama to see my son. Big son, ain&rsquo;t he? Lands! you wouldn&rsquo;t hardly think he&rsquo;d ever been a
baby, would ye? This is my son, sir.&rdquo;
Half turning, the old woman looked up at the standing man, her worn face lighting with
a proud and wonderful smile. She reached out one veined and calloused hand and took one
of her son&rsquo;s. Then smiling cheerily down at the prostrate man, she continued to dip the
handkerchief, in the waiting-room tin washbasin and gently apply it to his temple. She had
the benevolent garrulity of old age.
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen my son before,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;in eight years. One of my nephews,
Elkanah Price, he&rsquo;s a conductor on one of them railroads and he got me a pass to come out
here. I can stay a whole week on it, and then it&rsquo;ll take me back again. Jest think, now, that
little boy of mine has got to be a officer&ndash;a city marshal of a whole town! That&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo;
like a constable, ain&rsquo;t it? I never knowed he was a officer; he didn&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; about it in his
letters. I reckon he thought his old mother&rsquo;d be skeered about the danger he was in. But,
laws! I never was much of a hand to git skeered. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use. I heard them guns a-shootin&rsquo;
while I was gettin&rsquo; off them cars, and I see smoke a-comin&rsquo; out of the depot, but I jest walked
right along. Then I see son&rsquo;s face lookin&rsquo; out through the window. I knowed him at oncet. He
met me at the door, and squeezes me &lsquo;most to death. And there you was, sir, a-lyin&rsquo; there
jest like you was dead, and I &lsquo;lowed we&rsquo;d see what might be done to help sot you up.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll sit up now,&rdquo; said the concussion patient. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling pretty fair by this time.&ldquo;He sat, somewhat weakly yet, leaning against the wall. He was a rugged man,
big-boned and straight. His eyes, steady and keen, seemed to linger upon the face of the
man standing so still above him. His look wandered often from the face he studied to the
marshal&rsquo;s badge upon the other&rsquo;s breast.
&ldquo;Yes, yes, you&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; said the old woman, patting his arm, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t get to
cuttin&rsquo; up agin, and havin&rsquo; folks shooting at you. Son told me about you, sir, while you was
layin&rsquo; senseless on the floor. Don&rsquo;t you take it as meddlesome fer an old woman with a son
as big as you to talk about it. And you mustn&rsquo;t hold no grudge ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; my son for havin&rsquo; to
shoot at ye. A officer has got to take up for the law&ndash;it&rsquo;s his duty&ndash;and them that acts bad and
lives wrong has to suffer. Don&rsquo;t blame my son any, sir&ndash;&lsquo;tain&rsquo;t his fault. He&rsquo;s always been a
good boy&ndash;good when he was growin&rsquo; up, and kind and &lsquo;bedient and well-behaved. Won&rsquo;t
you let me advise you, sir, not to do so no more? Be a good man, and leave liquor alone and
live peaceably and goodly. Keep away from bad company and work honest and sleep sweet.&rdquo;
The black-mitted hand of the old pleader gently touched the breast of the man she
addressed. Very earnest and candid her old, worn face looked. In her rusty black dress and
antique bonnet she sat, near the close of a long life, and epitomised the experience of the
world. Still the man to whom she spoke gazed above her head, contemplating the silent son
of the old mother.
&ldquo;What does the marshal say?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Does he believe the advice is good? Suppose
the marshal speaks up and says if the talk&rsquo;s all right?&rdquo;
The tall man moved uneasily. He fingered the badge on his breast for a moment, and
then he put an arm around the old woman and drew her close to him. She smiled the
unchanging mother smile of three-score years, and patted his big brown hand with her
crooked, mittened fingers while her son spake.
&ldquo;I says this,&rdquo; he said, looking squarely into the eyes of the other man, &ldquo;that if I was in
your place I&rsquo;d follow it. If I was a drunken, desp&rsquo;rate character, without shame or hope, I&rsquo;d
follow it. If I was in your place and you was in mine I&rsquo;d say: &lsquo;Marshal, I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo; to swear if
you&rsquo;ll give me the chance I&rsquo;ll quit the racket. I&rsquo;ll drop the tanglefoot and the gun play, and
won&rsquo;t play hoss no more. I&rsquo;ll be a good citizen and go to work and quit my foolishness. So
help me God!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d say to you if you was marshal and I was in your place.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hear my son talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the old woman softly. &ldquo;Hear him, sir. You promise to be good
and he won&rsquo;t do you no harm. Forty-one year ago his heart first beat ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; mine, and it&rsquo;s
beat true ever since.&rdquo;
The other man rose to his feet, trying his limbs and stretching his muscles.
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you was in my place and said that, and I was marshal, I&rsquo;d say: &lsquo;Go
free, and do your best to keep your promise.&lsquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Lawsy!&rdquo; exclaimed the old woman, in a sudden flutter, &ldquo;ef I didn&rsquo;t clear forget that
trunk of mine! I see a man settin&rsquo; it on the platform jest as I seen son&rsquo;s face in the window,
and it went plum out of my head. There&rsquo;s eight jars of home-made quince jam in that trunk
that I made myself. I wouldn&rsquo;t have nothin&rsquo; happen to them jars for a red apple.&rdquo;
Away to the door she trotted, spry and anxious, and then Calliope Catesby spoke out to
Buck Patterson:
&ldquo;I just couldn&rsquo;t help it, Buck. I seen her through the window a-comin&rsquo; in. She never had
heard a word &lsquo;bout my tough ways. I didn&rsquo;t have the nerve to let her know I was a worthless
cuss bein&rsquo; hunted down by the community. There you was lyin&rsquo; where my shot laid you, like
you was dead. The idea struck me sudden, and I just took your badge off and fastened it
onto myself, and I fastened my reputation onto you. I told her I was the marshal and you was
a holy terror. You can take your badge back now, Buck.&rdquo;
With shaking fingers Calliope began to unfasten the disc of metal from his shirt.
&ldquo;Easy there!&rdquo; said Buck Patterson. &ldquo;You keep that badge right where it is, Calliope
Catesby. Don&rsquo;t you dare to take it off till the day your mother leaves this town. You&rsquo;ll be city
marshal of Quicksand as long as she&rsquo;s here to know it. After I stir around town a bit and put
&lsquo;em on I&rsquo;ll guarantee that nobody won&rsquo;t give the thing away to her. And say, you
leather-headed, rip-roarin&rsquo;, low-down son of a locoed cyclone, you follow that advice she
give me! I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to take some of it myself, too.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Buck,&rdquo; said Calliope feelingly, &ldquo;ef I don&rsquo;t I hope I may&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; said Buck. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo; back.&rdquo;
The Roads we Take （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>TWIENTY miles West of Tucson, the &ldquo;Sunset Express&rdquo; stopped at a tank to take on water.
Besides the aqueous, addition the engine of that famous flyer acquired some other things
that were not good for it.
While the fireman was lowering the feeding hose, Bob Tidball, &ldquo;Shark&rdquo; Dodson and a
quarter-bred Creek Indian called John Big Dog climbed on the engine and showed the
engineer three round orifices in pieces of ordnance that the carried. These orifices so
impressed the engineer with their possibilities that he raised both hands in a gesture such as
accompanies the ejaculation &ldquo;Do tell!&ldquo;At the crisp command of Shark Dodson, who was leader of the attacking force the
engineer descended to the ground and uncoupled the engine and tender. Then John Big Dog,
perched upon the coal, sportively held two guns upon the engine driver and the fireman,
and suggested that they run the engine fifty yards away and there await further orders.
Shark Dodson and Bob Tidball, scorning to put such low-grade ore as the passengers
through the mill, struck out for the rich pocket of the express car. They found the messenger
serene in the belief that the &ldquo;Sunset Express&rdquo; was taking on nothing more stimulating and
dangerous than aqua pura. While Bob was knocking this idea out of his head with the
butt-end of his six-shooter Shark Dodson was already dosing the express-car safe with
dynamite.
The safe exploded to the tune of $30,000, all gold and currency. The passengers thrust
their heads casually out of the windows to look for the thunder-cloud. The conductor jerked
at the bell-rope, which sagged down loose and unresisting, at his tug. Shark Dodson and Bob
Tidball, with their booty in a stout canvas bag, tumbled out of the express car and ran
awkwardly in their high-heeled boots to the engine.
The engineer, sullenly angry but wise, ran the engine, according to orders, rapidly away
from the inert train. But before this was accomplished the express messenger, recovered
from Bob Tidball&rsquo;s persuader to neutrality, jumped out of his car with a Winchester rifle and
took a trick in the game. Mr. John Big Dog, sitting on the coal tender, unwittingly made a
wrong lead by giving an imitation of a target, and the messenger trumped him. With a ball
exactly between his shoulder blades the Creek chevalier of industry rolled off to the ground,
thus increasing the share of his comrades in the loot by one-sixth each.
Two miles from the tank the engineer was ordered to stop.
The robbers waved a defiant adieu and plunged down the steep slope into the thick
woods that lined the track. Five minutes of crashing through a thicket of chapparal brought
them to open woods, where three horses were tied to low-hanging branches. One was
waiting for John Big Dog, who would never ride by night or day again. This animal the
robbers divested of saddle and bridle and set free. They mounted the other two with the
bag across one pommel, and rode fast and with discre- tion through the forest and up a
primeval, lonely gorge. Here the animal that bore Bob Tidball slipped on a mossy boulder
and broke a foreleg. They shot him through the head at once and sat down to hold a council
of flight. Made secure for the present by the tortuous trail they- had travelled, the question
of time was no longer so big. Many miles and hours lay between them and the spryest posse
that could follow. Shark Dodson&rsquo;s horse, with trailing rope and dropped bridle, panted and
cropped thankfully of the grass along the stream in the gorge. Bob Tidball opened the sack,
drew out double handfuls of the neat packages of currency and the one sack of gold and
chuckled with the glee of a child.&ldquo;Say, you old double-decked pirate,&rdquo; he called joyfully to Dodson, &ldquo;you said we could do
it &ndash; you got a head for financing that knocks the horns off of anything in Arizona.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What are we going to do about a hoss for you, Bob? We ain&rsquo;t got long to wait here.
They&rsquo;ll be on our trail before daylight in the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, I guess that cayuse of yourn&rsquo;ll carry double for a while,&rdquo; answered the sanguine
Bob. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll annex the first animal we come across. By jingoes, we made a haul, didn&rsquo;t we?
Accordin&rsquo; to the marks on this money there&rsquo;s $30,000 &ndash; $15,000 apiece!&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s short of what I expected,&rdquo; said Shark Dodson, kicking softly at the packages with
the toe of his boot and then he looked pensively at the wet sides of his tired horse.
&ldquo;Old Bolivar&rsquo;s mighty nigh played out,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;I wish that sorrel of yours
hadn&rsquo;t got hurt.&rdquo;
&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Bob, heartily, &ldquo;but it can&rsquo;t be helped. Bolivar&rsquo;s got plenty of bottom &ndash;
he&rsquo;ll get us both far enough to get fresh mounts. Dang it, Shark, I can&rsquo;t belp thinkin&rsquo; how
funny it is that an Easterner like you can come out here and give us Western fellows cards
and spades in the desperado business. What part of the East was you from, anyway?&rdquo;
&ldquo;New York State,&rdquo; said Shark Dodson, sitting down on a boulder and chewing a twig. &ldquo;I
was born on a farm in Ulster County. I ran away from home when I was seventeen. It was an
accident my coming West. I was walkin&rsquo; along the road with my clothes in a bundle, makin&rsquo;
for New York City. I had an idea of goin&rsquo; there and makin&rsquo; lots of money. I always felt like I
could do it. I came to a place one evenin&rsquo; where the road forked and I didn&rsquo;t know which
fork to take. I studied about it for half an hour, and then I took the left- hand. That night I run
into the camp of a Wild West show that was travellin&rsquo; among the little towns, and I went
West with it. I&rsquo;ve often wondered if I wouldn&rsquo;t have turned out different if I&rsquo;d took the other
road.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, I reckon you&rsquo;d have ended up about the same,&rdquo; said Bob Tidball, cheerfully
philosophical. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t the roads we take; it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s inside of us that makes us turn out the
way we do.&rdquo;
Shark Dodson got up and leaned against a tree.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d a good deal rather that sorrel of yourn hadn&rsquo;t hurt himself, Bob,&rdquo; he said again,
almost pathetically.
&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; agreed Bob; &ldquo;he was sure a first-rate kind of a crowbait. But Bolivar, he&rsquo;ll
pull us through all right. Reckon we&rsquo;d better be movin&rsquo; on, hadn&rsquo;t we, Shark? I&rsquo;ll bag this
boodle ag&rsquo;in and we&rsquo;ll hit the trail for higher timber.&ldquo;Bob Tidball replaced the spoil in the bag and tied the mouth of it tightly with a cord.
When he looked up the most prominent object that he saw was the muzzle of Shark
Dodson&rsquo;s .45 held upon him without a waver.
&ldquo;Stop your funnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Bob, with a grin. &ldquo;We got to be hittin&rsquo; the breeze.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Set still,&rdquo; said Shark. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to hit no breeze, Bob. I hate to tell you, but there
ain&rsquo;t any chance for but one of us. Bolivar, he&rsquo;s plenty tired, and he can&rsquo;t carry double.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We been pards, me and you, Shark Dodson, for three year,&rdquo; Bob said quietly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
risked our lives together time and again. I&rsquo;ve always give you a square deal, and I thought
you was a man. I&rsquo;ve heard some queer stories about you shootin&rsquo; one or two men in a
peculiar way, but I never believed &lsquo;em. Now if you&rsquo;re just havin&rsquo; a little fun with me, Shark,
put your gun up, and we&rsquo;ll get on Bolivar and vamose. If you mean to shoot &ndash; shoot, you
blackhearted son of a tarantula!&rdquo;
Shark Dodson&rsquo;s face bore a deeply sorrowful look. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how bad I feel,&rdquo; he
sighed, &ldquo;about that sorrel of yourn breakin&rsquo; his leg, Bob.&rdquo;
The expression on Dodson&rsquo;s face changed in an instant to one of cold ferocity mingled
with inexorable cupidity. The soul of the man showed itself for a moment like an evil face in
the window of a reputable house.
Truly Bob Tidball was never to &ldquo;hit the breeze&rdquo; again. The deadly .45 of the false friend
cracked and filled the gorge with a roar that the walls hurled back with indignant echoes.
And Bolivar, unconscious accomplice, swiftly bore away the last of the holders-up of the
&ldquo;Sunset Express,&rdquo; not put to the stress of &ldquo;carrying double.&rdquo;
But as &ldquo;Shark&rdquo; Dodson galloped away the woods seemed to fade from his view; the
revolver in his right hand turned to the curved arm of a mahogany chair; his saddle was
strangely upholstered, and he opened his eyes and saw his feet, not in stirrups, but resting
quietly on the edge of a quartered-oak desk.
I am telling you that Dodson, of the firm of Dodson &amp; Decker, Wall Street brokers,
opened his eyes. Peabody, the confidential clerk, was standing by his chair, hesitating to
speak. There was a confused hum of wheels below, and the sedative buzz of an electric fan.
&ldquo;Ahem! Peabody,&rdquo; said Dodson, blinking. &ldquo;I must have fallen asleep. I had a most
remarkable dream. What is it, Peabody?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mr. Williams, sir, of Tracy &amp; Williams, is outside. He has come to settle his deal in X. Y.
Z. The market caught him short, sir, if you remember.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, I remember. What is X. Y. Z. quoted at to-day, Peabody?&rdquo;&ldquo;One eighty-five, sir.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s his price.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Peabody, rather nervously &ldquo;for speaking of it, but I&rsquo;ve been talking to
Williams. He&rsquo;s an old friend of yours, Mr. Dodson, and you practically have a corner in X. Y. Z.
I thought you might &ndash; that is, I thought you might not remember that he sold you the stock
at 98. If he settles at the market price it will take every cent he has in the world and his
home too to deliver the shares.&rdquo;
The expression on Dodson&rsquo;s face changed in an instant to one of cold ferocity mingled
with inexorable cupidity. The soul of the man showed itself for a moment like an evil face in
the window of a reputable house.
&ldquo;He will settle at one eighty-five,&rdquo; said Dodson. &ldquo;Bolivar cannot carry double.&rdquo;
The Robe Of Peace （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Mysteries follow one another so closely in a great city that the reading public and the
friends of Johnny Bellchambers have ceased to marvel at his sudden and unexplained
disappearance nearly a year ago. This particular mystery has now been cleared up, but the
solution is so strange and incredible to the mind of the average man that only a select few
who were in close touch with Bellchambers will give it full credence.
Johnny Bellchambers, as is well known, belonged to the intrinsically inner circle of the
elite. Without any of the ostentation of the fashionable ones who endeavor to attract notice
by eccentric display of wealth and show he still was au fait in everything that gave deserved
lustre to his high position in the ranks of society.
Especially did he shine in the matter of dress. In this he was the despair of imitators.
Always correct, exquisitely groomed, and possessed of an unlimited wardrobe, he was
conceded to be the best-dressed man in New York, and, therefore, in America. There was
not a tailor in Gotham who would not have deemed it a precious boon to have been granted
the privilege of making Bellchambers&rsquo; clothes without a cent of pay. As he wore them, they
would have been a priceless advertisement. Trousers were his special passion. Here nothing
but perfection would he notice. He would have worn a patch as quickly as he would have
overlooked a wrinkle. He kept a man in his apartments always busy pressing his ample
supply. His friends said that three hours was the limit of time that he would wear these
garments without exchanging.Bellchambers disappeared very suddenly. For three days his absence brought no alarm
to his friends, and then they began to operate the usual methods of inquiry. All of them
failed. He had left absolutely no trace behind. Then the search for a motive was instituted,
but none was found. He had no enemies, he had no debts, there was no woman. There were
several thousand dollars in his bank to his credit. He had never showed any tendency toward
mental eccentricity; in fact, he was of a particularly calm and well-balanced temperament.
Every means of tracing the vanished man was made use of, but without avail. It was one of
those cases - more numerous in late years - where men seem to have gone out like the
flame of a candle, leaving not even a trail of smoke as a witness.
In May, Tom Eyres and Lancelot Gilliam, two of Bellchambers&rsquo; old friends, went for a
little run on the other side. While pottering around in Italy and Switzerland, they happened,
one day, to hear of a monastery in the Swiss Alps that promised something outside of the
ordinary tourist-beguiling attractions. The monastery was almost inaccessible to the average
sightseer, being on an extremely rugged and precipitous spur of the mountains. The
attractions it possessed but did not advertise were, first, an exclusive and divine cordial
made by the monks that was said to far surpass benedictine and chartreuse. Next a huge
brass bell so purely and accurately cast that it had not ceased sounding since it was first rung
three hundred years ago. Finally, it was asserted that no Englishman had ever set foot within
its walls. Eyres and Gilliam decided that these three reports called for investigation.
It took them two days with the aid of two guides to reach the monastery of St. Gondrau.
It stood upon a frozen, wind-swept crag with the snow piled about it in treacherous, drifting
masses. They were hospitably received by the brothers whose duty it was to entertain the
infrequent guest. They drank of the precious cordial, finding it rarely potent and reviving.
They listened to the great, ever-echoing bell, and learned that they were pioneer travelers,
in those gray stone walls, over the Englishman whose restless feet have trodden nearly every
corner of the earth.
At three o&rsquo;clock on the afternoon they arrived, the two young Gothamites stood with
good Brother Cristofer in the great, cold hallway of the monastery to watch the monks
march past on their way to the refectory. They came slowly, pacing by twos, with their heads
bowed, treading noiselessly with sandaled feet upon the rough stone flags. As the
procession slowly filed past, Eyres suddenly gripped Gilliam by the arm. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he
whispered, eagerly, &ldquo;at the one just opposite you now - the one on this side, with his hand at
his waist - if that isn&rsquo;t Johnny Bellchambers then I never saw him!&rdquo;
Gilliam saw and recognized the lost glass of fashion.
&ldquo;What the deuce,&rdquo; said he, wonderingly, &ldquo;is old Bell doing here? Tommy, it surely can&rsquo;t
be he! Never heard of Bell having a turn for the religious. Fact is, I&rsquo;ve heard him say things
when a four-in-hand didn&rsquo;t seem to tie up just right that would bring him up for
court-martial before any church.&ldquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bell, without a doubt,&rdquo; said Eyres, firmly, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;m pretty badly in need of an oculist.
But think of Johnny Bellchambers, the Royal High Chancellor of swell togs and the Mahatma
of pink teas, up here in cold storage doing penance in a snuff-colored bathrobe! I can&rsquo;t get it
straight in my mind. Let&rsquo;s ask the jolly old boy that&rsquo;s doing honors.&rdquo;
Brother Cristofer was appealed to for information. By that time the monks had passed
into the refectory. He could not tell to which one they referred. Bellchambers? Ah, the
brothers of St. Gondrau abandoned their worldly names when they took the vows. Did the
gentlemen wish to speak with one of the brothers? If they would come to the refectory and
indicate the one they wished to see, the reverend abbot in authority would, doubtless,
permit it.
Eyres and Gilliam went into the dining hall and pointed out to Brother Cristofer the man
they had seen. Yes, it was Johnny Bellchambers. They saw his face plainly now, as he sat
among the dingy brothers, never looking up, eating broth from a coarse, brown bowl.
Permission to speak to one of the brothers was granted to the two travelers by the
abbot, and they waited in a reception room for him to come. When he did come, treading
softly in his sandals, both Eyres and Gilliam looked at him in perplexity and astonishment. It
was Johnny Bellchambers, but he had a different look. Upon his smooth-shaven face was an
expression of ineffable peace, of rapturous attainment, of perfect and complete happiness.
His form was proudly erect, his eyes shone with a serene and gracious light. He was as neat
and well-groomed as in the old New York days, but how differently was he clad! Now he
seemed clothed in but a single garment - a long robe of rough brown cloth, gathered by a
cord at the waist, and falling in straight, loose folds nearly to his feet. He shook hands with
his visitors with his old ease and grace of manner. If there was any embarrassment in that
meeting it was not manifested by Johnny Bellchambers. The room had no seats; they stood
to converse.
&ldquo;Glad to see you, old man,&rdquo; said Eyres, somewhat awkwardly. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t expecting to find
you up here. Not a bad idea though, after all. Society&rsquo;s an awful sham. Must be a relief to
shake the giddy whirl and retire to - er - contemplation and - er - prayer and hymns, and
those things.
&ldquo;Oh, cut that, Tommy,&rdquo; said Bellchambers, cheerfully. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid that I&rsquo;ll pass
around the plate. I go through these thing-um-bobs with the rest of these old boys because
they are the rules. I&rsquo;m Brother Ambrose here, you know. I&rsquo;m given just ten minutes to talk to
you fellows. That&rsquo;s rather a new design in waistcoats you have on, isn&rsquo;t it, Gilliam? Are they
wearing those things on Broadway now?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same old Johnny,&rdquo; said Gilliam, joyfully. &ldquo;What the devil - I mean why - Oh,
confound it! what did you do it for, old man?&ldquo;&ldquo;Peel the bathrobe,&rdquo; pleaded Eyres, almost tearfully, &ldquo;and go back with us. The old
crowd&rsquo;ll go wild to see you. This isn&rsquo;t in your line, Bell. I know half a dozen girls that wore the
willow on the quiet when you shook us in that unaccountable way. Hand in your resignation,
or get a dispensation, or whatever you have to do to get a release from this ice factory. You&rsquo;ll
get catarrh here, Johnny - and - My God! you haven&rsquo;t any socks on!&rdquo;
Bellchambers looked down at his sandaled feet and smiled.
&ldquo;You fellows don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he said, soothingly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice of you to want me to go
back, but the old life will never know me again. I have reached here the goal of all my
ambitions. I am entirely happy and contented. Here I shall remain for the remainder of my
days. You see this robe that I wear?&rdquo; Bellchambers caressingly touched the straight-hanging
garment: &ldquo;At last I have found something that will not bag at the knees. I have attained -&rdquo;
At that moment the deep boom of the great brass bell reverberated through the
monastery. It must have been a summons to immediate devotions, for Brother Ambrose
bowed his head, turned and left the chamber without another word. A slight wave of his
hand as he passed through the stone doorway seemed to say a farewell to his old friends.
They left the monastery without seeing him again.
And this is the story that Tommy Eyres and Lancelot Gilliam brought back with them
from their latest European tour.
The Romance of a Busy Broker （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Pitcher, confidential clerk in the office of Harvey Maxwell, broker, allowed a look of mild
interest and surprise to visit his usually expressionless countenance when his employer
briskly entered at half past nine in company with his young lady stenographer. With a
snappy Good-morning, Pitcher, Maxwell dashed at his desk as though he were intending to
leap over it, and then plunged into the great heap of letters and telegrams waiting there for
him.
The young lady had been Maxwell&rsquo;s stenographer for a year. She was beautiful in a way
that was decidedly unstenographic. She forewent the pomp of the alluring pompadour. She
wore no chains, bracelets or lockets. She had not the air of being about to accept an
invitation to luncheon. Her dress was grey and plain, but it fitted her figure with fidelity and
discretion. In her neat black turban hat was the gold-green wing of a macaw. On this
morning she was softly and shyly radiant. Her eyes were dreamily bright, her cheeks genuine
peachblow, her expression a happy one, tinged with reminiscence.Pitcher, still mildly curious, noticed a difference in her ways this morning. Instead of
going straight into the adjoining room, where her desk was, she lingered, slightly irresolute,
in the outer office. Once she moved over by Maxwell&rsquo;s desk, near enough for him to be
aware of her presence.
The machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man; it was a busy New York broker,
moved by buzzing wheels and uncoiling springs.
Well&ndash;what is it Anything asked Maxwell sharply. His opened mail lay like a bank of
stage snow on his crowded desk. His keen grey eye, impersonal and brusque, flashed upon
her half impatiently.
Nothing, answered the stenographer, moving away with a little smile.
Mr. Pitcher, she said to the confidential clerk, did Mr. Maxwell say anything yesterday
about engaging another stenographer
He did, answered Pitcher. He told me to get another one. I notified the agency
yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples this morning. It&rsquo;s 9.45 o&rsquo;clock, and not a
single picture hat or piece of pineapple chewing gum has showed up yet.
I will do the work as usual, then, said the young lady, until some one comes to fill the
place. And she went to her desk at once and hung the black turban hat with the gold-green
macaw wing in its accustomed place.
He who has been denied the spectacle of a busy Manhattan broker during a rush of
business is handicapped for the profession of anthropology. The poet sings of the crowded
hour of glorious life. The broker&rsquo;s hour is not only crowded, but the minutes and seconds are
hanging to all the straps and packing both front and rear platforms.
And this day was Harvey Maxwell&rsquo;s busy day. The ticker began to reel out jerkily its fitful
coils of tape, the desk telephone had a chronic attack of buzzing. Men began to throng into
the office and call at him over the railing, jovially, sharply, viciously, excitedly. Messenger
boys ran in and out with messages and telegrams. The clerks in the office jumped about like
sailors during a storm. Even Pitcher&rsquo;s face relaxed into something resembling animation.
On the Exchange there were hurricanes and landslides and snowstorms and glaciers
and volcanoes, and those elemental disturbances were reproduced in miniature in the
broker&rsquo;s offices. Maxwell shoved his chair against the wall and transacted business after the
manner of a toe dancer. He jumped from ticker to &lsquo;phone, from desk to door with the
trained agility of a harlequin.
In the midst of this growing and important stress the broker became suddenly aware of
a high-rolled fringe of golden hair under a nodding canopy of velvet and ostrich tips, animitation sealskin sacque and a string of beads as large as hickory nuts, ending near the floor
with a silver heart. There was a self-possessed young lady connected with these accessories;
and Pitcher was there to construe her.
Lady from the Stenographer&rsquo;s Agency to see about the position, said Pitcher.
Maxwell turned half around, with his hands full of papers and ticker tape.
What position he asked, with a frown.
Position of stenographer, said Pitcher. You told me yesterday to call them up and have
one sent over this morning.
You are losing your mind, Pitcher, said Maxwell. Why should I have given you any such
instructions Miss Leslie has given perfect satisfaction during the year she has been here. The
place is hers as long as she chooses to retain it. There&rsquo;s no place open here, madam.
Countermand that order with the agency, Pitcher, and don&rsquo;t bring any more of &lsquo;em in here.
The silver heart left the office, swinging and banging itself independently against the
office furniture as it indignantly departed. Pitcher seized a moment to remark to the
bookkeeper that the old man seemed to get more absent-minded and forgetful every day of
the world.
The rush and pace of business grew fiercer and faster. On the floor they were pounding
half a dozen stocks in which Maxwell&rsquo;s customers were heavy investors. Orders to buy and
sell were coming and going as swift as the flight of swallows. Some of his own holdings were
imperilled, and the man was working like some high-geared, delicate, strong
machine&ndash;strung to full tension, going at full speed, accurate, never hesitating, with the
proper word and decision and act ready and prompt as clockwork. Stocks and bonds, loans
and mortgages, margins and securities&ndash;here was a world of finance, and there was no room
in it for the human world or the world of nature.
When the luncheon hour drew near there came a slight lull in the uproar.
Maxwell stood by his desk with his hands full of telegrams and memoranda, with a
fountain pen over his right ear and his hair hanging in disorderly strings over his forehead.
His window was open, for the beloved janitress Spring had turned on a little warmth through
the waking registers of the earth.
And through the window came a wandering&ndash;perhaps a lost&ndash;odour&ndash;a delicate, sweet
odour of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment immovable. For this odour belonged to
Miss Leslie; it was her own, and hers only.The odour brought her vividly, almost tangibly before him. The world of finance
dwindled suddenly to a speck. And she was in the next room&ndash;twenty steps away.
By George, I&rsquo;ll do it now, said Maxwell, half aloud. I&rsquo;ll ask her now. I wonder I didn&rsquo;t do it
long ago.
He dashed into the inner office with the haste of a short trying to cover. He charged
upon the desk of the stenographer.
She looked up at him with a smile. A soft pink crept over her cheek, and her eyes were
kind and frank. Maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk. He still clutched fluttering papers
with both hands and the pen was above his ear.
Miss Leslie, he began hurriedly, I have but a moment to spare. I want to say something
in that moment. Will you he my wife I haven&rsquo;t had time to make love to you in the ordinary
way, but I really do love you. Talk quick, please&ndash;those fellows are clubbing the stuffing out of
Union Pacific.
Oh, what are you talking about exclaimed the young lady. She rose to her feet and
gazed upon him, round-eyed.
Don&rsquo;t you understand said Maxwell, restively. I want you to marry me. I love you, Miss
Leslie. I wanted to tell you, and I snatched a minute when things had slackened up a bit.
They&rsquo;re calling me for the &lsquo;phone now. Tell &lsquo;em to wait a minute, Pitcher. Won&rsquo;t you, Miss
Leslie
The stenographer acted very queerly. At first she seemed overcome with amazement;
then tears flowed from her wondering eyes; and then she smiled sunnily through them, and
one of her arms slid tenderly about the broker&rsquo;s neck.
I know now, she said, softly. It&rsquo;s this old business that has driven everything else out of
your head for the time. I was frightened at first. Don&rsquo;t you remember, Harvey We were
married last evening at 8 o&rsquo;clock in the Little Church Around the Corner.
The Rose of Dixie （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>When The Rose of Dixie magazine was started by a stock company in Toombs City,
Georgia, there was never but one candidate for its chief editorial position in the minds of its
owners. Col. Aquila Telfair was the man for the place. By all the rights of learning, family,
reputation, and Southern traditions, he was its foreordained, fit, and logical editor. So, acommittee of the patriotic Georgia citizens who had subscribed the founding fund of
$100,000 called upon Colonel Telfair at his residence, Cedar Heights, fearful lest the
enterprise and the South should suffer by his possible refusal.
The colonel received them in his great library, where he spent most of his days. The
library had descended to him from his father. It contained ten thousand volumes, some of
which had been published as late as the year 1861. When the deputation arrived, Colonel
Telfair was seated at his massive white-pine centre-table, reading Burton&rsquo;s Anatomy of
Melancholy. He arose and shook hands punctiliously with each member of the committee. If
you were familiar with The Rose of Dixie you will remember the colonel&rsquo;s portrait, which
appeared in it from time to time. You could not forget the long, carefully brushed white hair;
the hooked, high-bridged nose, slightly twisted to the left; the keen eyes under the still black
eyebrows; the classic mouth beneath the drooping white mustache, slightly frazzled at the
ends.
The committee solicitously offered him the position of managing editor, humbly
presenting an outline of the field that the publication was designed to cover and mentioning
a comfortable salary. The colonel&rsquo;s lands were growing poorer each year and were much cut
up by red gullies. Besides, the honor was not one to be refused.
In a forty-minute speech of acceptance, Colonel Telfair gave an outline of English
literature from Chaucer to Macaulay, re-fought the battle of Chancellorsville, and said that,
God helping him, he would so conduct The Rose of Dixie that its fragrance and beauty would
permeate the entire world, hurling back into the teeth of the Northern minions their belief
that no genius or good could exist in the brains and hearts of the people whose property
they had destroyed and whose rights they had curtailed.
Offices for the magazine were partitioned off and furnished in the second floor of the
First National Bank building; and it was for the colonel to cause The Rose of Dixie to blossom
and flourish or to wilt in the balmy air of the land of flowers.
The staff of assistants and contributors that Editor-Colonel Telfair drew about him was a
peach. It was a whole crate of Georgia peaches. The first assistant editor, Tolliver Lee Fairfax,
had had a father killed during Pickett&rsquo;s charge. The second assistant, Keats Unthank, was the
nephew of one of Morgan&rsquo;s Raiders. The book reviewer, Jackson Rockingham, had been the
youngest soldier in the Confederate army, having appeared on the field of battle with a
sword in one hand and a milk-bottle in the other. The art editor, Roncesvalles Sykes, was a
third cousin to a nephew of Jefferson Davis. Miss Lavinia Terhune, the colonel&rsquo;s
stenographer and typewriter, had an aunt who had once been kissed by Stonewall Jackson.
Tommy Webster, the head office-boy, got his job by having recited Father Ryan&rsquo;s poems,
complete, at the commencement exercises of the Toombs City High School. The girls who
wrapped and addressed the magazines were members of old Southern families in Reduced
Circumstances. The cashier was a scrub named Hawkins, from Ann Arbor, Michigan, who hadrecommendations and a bond from a guarantee company filed with the owners. Even
Georgia stock companies sometimes realize that it takes live ones to bury the dead.
Well, sir, if you believe me, The Rose of Dixie blossomed five times before anybody
heard of it except the people who buy their hooks and eyes in Toombs City. Then Hawkins
climbed off his stool and told on &lsquo;em to the stock company. Even in Ann Arbor he had been
used to having his business propositions heard of at least as far away as Detroit. So an
advertising manager was engaged &ndash; Beauregard Fitzhugh Banks, a young man in a lavender
necktie, whose grandfather had been the Exalted High Pillow-slip of the Kuklux Klan.
In spite of which The Rose of Dixie kept coming out every month. Although in every
issue it ran photos of either the Taj Mahal or the Luxembourg Gardens, or Carmencita or La
Follette, a certain number of people bought it and subscribed for it. As a boom for it, EditorColonel Telfair ran three different views of Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s old home, &ldquo;The Hermitage,&rdquo; a
full-page engraving of the second battle of Manassas, entitled &ldquo;Lee to the Rear!&rdquo; and a
five-thousand-word biography of Belle Boyd in the same number. The subscription list that
month advanced 118. Also there were poems in the same issue by Leonina Vashti Haricot
(pen-name), related to the Haricots of Charleston, South Carolina, and Bill Thompson,
nephew of one of the stockholders. And an article from a special society correspondent
describing a tea-party given by the swell Boston and English set, where a lot of tea was
spilled overboard by some of the guests masquerading as Indians.
One day a person whose breath would easily cloud a mirror, he was so much alive,
entered the office of The Rose of Dixie. He was a man about the size of a real-estate agent,
with a self-tied tie and a manner that he must have borrowed conjointly from W J. Bryan,
Hackenschmidt, and Hetty Green. He was shown into the editor- colonel&rsquo;s pons asinorum.
Colonel Telfair rose and began a Prince Albert bow.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Thacker,&rdquo; said the intruder, taking the editor&rsquo;s chair&ndash;&ldquo;T. T. Thacker, of New York.&rdquo;
He dribbled hastily upon the colonel&rsquo;s desk some cards, a bulky manila envelope, and a
letter from the owners of The Rose of Dixie. This letter introduced Mr. Thacker, and politely
requested Colonel Telfair to give him a conference and whatever information about the
magazine he might desire.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been corresponding with the secretary of the magazine owners for some time,&rdquo;
said Thacker, briskly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a practical magazine man myself, and a circulation booster as good
as any, if I do say it. I&rsquo;ll guarantee an increase of anywhere from ten thousand to a hundred
thousand a year for any publication that isn&rsquo;t printed in a dead language. I&rsquo;ve had my eye on
The Rose of Dixie ever since it started. I know every end of the business from editing to
setting up the classified ads. Now, I&rsquo;ve come down here to put a good bunch of money in the
magazine, if I can see my way clear. It ought to be made to pay. The secretary tells me it&rsquo;s
losing money. I don&rsquo;t see why a magazine in the South, if it&rsquo;s properly handled, shouldn&rsquo;t get
a good circulation in the North, too.&ldquo;Colonel Telfair leaned back in his chair and polished his gold-rimmed glasses.
&ldquo;Mr. Thacker,&rdquo; said he, courteously but firmly, &ldquo;The Rose of Dixie is a publication
devoted to the fostering and the voicing of Southern genius. Its watchword, which you may
have seen on the cover, is &lsquo;Of, For, and By the South.&rsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t object to a Northern circulation, would you?&rdquo; asked Thacker.
&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said the editor-colonel, &ldquo;that it is customary to open the circulation lists to
all. I do not know. I have nothing to do with the business affairs of the magazine. I was called
upon to assume editorial control of it, and I have devoted to its conduct such poor literary
talents as I may possess and whatever store of erudition I may have acquired.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Thacker. &ldquo;But a dollar is a dollar anywhere, North, South, or West&ndash;whether
you&rsquo;re buying codfish, goober peas, or Rocky Ford cantaloupes. Now, I&rsquo;ve been looking over
your November number. I see one here on your desk. You don&rsquo;t mind running over it with
me?
&ldquo;Well, your leading article is all right. A good write-up of the cotton-belt with plenty of
photographs is a winner any time. New York is always interested in the cotton crop. And this
sensational account of Hatfield-McCoy feud, by a schoolmate of a niece of the Governor of
Kentucky, isn&rsquo;t such a bad idea. It happened so long ago that most people have forgotten it.
Now, here&rsquo;s a poem three pages long called &lsquo;The Tyrant&rsquo;s Foot,&rsquo; by Lorella Lascelles. I&rsquo;ve
pawed around a good deal over manuscripts, but I never saw her name on a rejection slip.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Miss Lascelles,&rdquo; said the editor, &ldquo;is one of our most widely recognized Southern
poetesses. She is closely related to the Alabama Lascelles family, and made with her own
hands the silken Confederate banner that was presented to the governor of that state at his
inauguration.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; persisted Thacker, &ldquo;is the poem illustrated with a view of the M. &amp; 0.
Railroad freight depot at Tuscaloosa?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The illustration,&rdquo; said the colonel, with dignity, &ldquo;shows a corner of the fence
surrounding the old homestead where Miss Lascelles was born.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Thacker. &ldquo;I read the poem, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell whether it was about the
depot of the battle of Bull Run. Now, here&rsquo;s a short story called &lsquo;Rosies&rsquo; Temptation,&rsquo; by
Fosdyke Piggott. It&rsquo;s rotten. What is a Piggott, anyway?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mr. Piggott,&rdquo; said the editor, &ldquo;is a brother of the principal stockholder of the
magazine.&ldquo;&ldquo;All&rsquo;s right with the world&ndash;Piggott passes,&rdquo; said Thacker. &ldquo;Well this article on Arctic
exploration and the one on tarpon fishing might go. But how about this write-up of the
Atlanta, New Orleans, Nashville, and Savannah breweries? It seems to consist mainly of
statistics about their output and the quality of their beer. What&rsquo;s the chip over the bug?&rdquo;
&ldquo;If I understand your figurative language,&rdquo; answered Colonel Telfair, &ldquo;it is this: the
article you refer to was handed to me by the owners of the magazine with instructions to
publish it. The literary quality of it did not appeal to me. But, in a measure, I feel impelled to
conform, in certain matters, to the wishes of the gentlemen who are interested in the
financial side of The Rose.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Thacker. &ldquo;Next we have two pages of selections from &lsquo;Lalla Rookh,&rsquo; by
Thomas Moore. Now, what Federal prison did Moore escape from, or what&rsquo;s the name of
the F. F. V. family that he carries as a handicap?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Moore was an Irish poet who died in 1852,&rdquo; said Colonel Telfair, pityingly. &ldquo;He is a
classic. I have been thinking of reprinting his translation of Anacreon serially in the
magazine.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Look out for the copyright laws,&rdquo; said Thacker, flippantly. Who&rsquo;s Bessie Belleclair, who
contributes the essay on the newly completed water-works plant in Milledgeville?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The name, sir,&rdquo; said Colonel Telfair, &ldquo;is the nom de guerre of Miss Elvira Simpkins. I
have not the honor of knowing the lady; but her contribution was sent to us by
Congressman Brower, of her native state. Congressman Brower&rsquo;s mother was related to the
Polks of Tennessee.
&ldquo;Now, see here, Colonel,&rdquo; said Thacker, throwing down the magazine, &ldquo;this won&rsquo;t do.
You can&rsquo;t successfully run a magazine for one particular section of the country. You&rsquo;ve got to
make a universal appeal. Look how the Northern publications have catered to the South and
encouraged the Southern writers. And you&rsquo;ve got to go far and wide for your contributors.
You&rsquo;ve got to buy stuff according to its quality without any regard to the pedigree of the
author. Now, I&rsquo;ll bet a quart of ink that this Southern parlor organ you&rsquo;ve been running has
never played a note that originated about Mason &amp; Hamlin&rsquo;s line. Am I right?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have carefully and conscientiously rejected all contributions from that section of the
country&ndash;if I understand your figurative language aright,&rdquo; replied the colonel.
&ldquo;All right. Now I&rsquo;ll show you something.&rdquo;
Thacker reached for his thick manila envelope and dumped a mass of typewritten
manuscript on the editors desk.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some truck,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I paid cash for, and brought along with me.&ldquo;One by one he folded back the manuscripts and showed their first pages to the colonel.
Here are four short stories four of the highest priced authors in the United States&ndash;three
of &lsquo;em living in New York, and one commuting. There&rsquo;s a special article on Vienna-bred
society by Tom Vampson. Here&rsquo;s an Italian serial by Captain Jack&ndash;no&ndash;it&rsquo;s the other Crawford.
Here are three separate exposes of city governments by Sniffings, and here&rsquo;s a dandy
entitled &lsquo;What Women Carry in Dress-Suit Cases&rsquo;&ndash;a Chicago newspaper woman hired herself
out for five years as a lady&rsquo;s maid to get that information. And here&rsquo;s a Synopsis of Preceding
Chapters of Hall Caine&rsquo;s new serial to appear next June. And here&rsquo;s a couple of pounds of
vers de societe that I got at a rate from the clever magazines. That&rsquo;s the stuff that people
everywhere want. And now here&rsquo;s a writeup with photographs at the ages of four, twelve,
twenty-two, and thirty of George B. McClellan. It&rsquo;s a prognostication. He&rsquo;s bound to be
elected Mayor of New York. It &lsquo;11 make a big hit all over the country. He&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Colonel Telfair, stiffening in his chair. &ldquo;What was the name?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Thacker, with half a grin. Yes, he&rsquo;s a son of the General. We&rsquo;ll pass that
manuscript up. But, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, Colonel, it&rsquo;s a magazine we&rsquo;re trying to make go
off&ndash;not the first gun at Fort Sumter. Now, here&rsquo;s a thing that&rsquo;s bound to get next to you. It&rsquo;s
an original poem by James Whitcomb Riley. J.W. himself. You know what that means to a
magazine. I won&rsquo;t tell you what I had to pay for that poem; but I&rsquo;ll tell you this&ndash;Riley can
make more money writing with a fountain-pen than you or I can with one that lets the ink
run. I&rsquo;ll read you the last two stanzas:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Pa lays around &lsquo;n&rsquo; loafs all day,
&lsquo;N&rsquo; reads and makes us leave him be.
He lets me do just like I please,
&lsquo;N&rsquo; when I&rsquo;m in bad he laughs at me,
&lsquo;N&rsquo; when I holler loud &lsquo;n&rsquo; say
Bad words &lsquo;n&rsquo; then begin to tease
The cat, &lsquo;n&rsquo; pa just smiles, ma&rsquo;s mad
&lsquo;N&rsquo; gives me Jesse crost her knees.
I always wondered why that wuzI guess it&rsquo;s cause
Pa never does.
&ldquo;&ldquo;N&rsquo; after all the lights are out
I&rsquo;m sorry &lsquo;bout it; so I creep
Out of my trundle bed to ma&rsquo;s
&lsquo;N&rsquo; say I love her a whole heap,
&lsquo;N&rsquo; kiss her, &lsquo;n&rsquo; I hug her tight.
&lsquo;N&rsquo; it&rsquo;s too dark to see her eyes,
But every time I do I knowShe cries &lsquo;n&rsquo; cries &lsquo;n&rsquo; cries &lsquo;n&rsquo; cries.
I always wondered why that wuzI guess it&rsquo;s &lsquo;cause
Pa never does.&rsquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff,&rdquo; continued Thacker. &ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am not unfamiliar with the works of Mr. Riley,&rdquo; said the colonel, deliberately. &ldquo;I
believe he lives in Indiana. For the last ten years I have been somewhat of a literary recluse,
and am familiar with nearly all the books in the Cedar Heights library. I am also of the
opinion that a magazine should contain a certain amount of poetry. Many of the sweetest
singers of the South have already contributed to the pages of The Rose of Dixie. I, myself,
have thought of translating from the original for publication in its pages the works of the
great Italian poet Tasso. Have you ever drunk from the fountain of this immortal poet&rsquo;s lines,
Mr. Thacker?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not even a demi-Tasso,&rdquo; said Thacker.
Now, let&rsquo;s come to the point, Colonel Telfair. I&rsquo;ve already invested some money in this as
a flyer. That bunch of manuscripts cost me $4,000. My object was to try a number of them in
the next issue-I believe you make up less than a month ahead&ndash;and see what effect it has on
the circulation. I believe that by printing the best stuff we can get in the North, South, East,
or West we can make the magazine go. You have there the letter from the owning company
asking you to co-operate with me in the plan. Let&rsquo;s chuck out some of this slush that you&rsquo;ve
been publishing just because the writers are related to the Skoopdoodles of Skoopdoodle
County. Are you with me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;As long as I continue to be the editor of The Rose,&rdquo; said Colonel Telfair, with dignity, &ldquo;I
shall be its editor. But I desire also to conform to the wishes of its owners if I can do so
conscientiously.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk,&rdquo; said Thacker, briskly. &ldquo;Now, how much of this stuff I&rsquo;ve brought can we
get into the January number? We want to begin right away.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There is yet space in the January number,&rdquo; said the editor, &ldquo;for about eight thousand
words, roughly estimated.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; said Thacker. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much, but it&rsquo;ll give the readers some change from
goobers, governors, and Gettysburg. I&rsquo;ll leave the selection of the stuff I brought to fill the
space to you, as it&rsquo;s all good. I&rsquo;ve got to run back to New York, and I&rsquo;ll be down again in a
couple of weeks.&rdquo;
Colonel Telfair slowly swung his eye-glasses by their broad, black ribbon.&ldquo;The space in the January number that I referred to,&rdquo; said he, measuredly, &ldquo;has been
held open purposely, pending a decision that I have not yet made. A short time ago a
contribution was submitted to The Rose of Dixie that is one of the most remarkable literary
efforts that has ever come under my observation. None but a master mind and talent could
have produced it. It would just fill the space that I have reserved for its possible use.&rdquo;
Thacker looked anxious.
&ldquo;What kind of stuff is it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Eight thousand words sounds suspicious. The
oldest families must have been collaborating. Is there going to be another secession ?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The author of the article,&rdquo; continued the colonel, ignoring Thacker&rsquo;s allusions, &ldquo;is a
writer of some reputation. He has also distinguished himself in other ways. I do not feel at
liberty to reveal to you his name&ndash;at least not until I have decided whether or not to accept
his contribution.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Thacker, nervously, &ldquo;is it a continued story, or an account of the unveiling of
the new town pump in Whitmire, South Carolina, or a revised list of General Lee&rsquo;s
body-servants, or what?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You are disposed to be facetious,&rdquo; said Colonel Telfair, calmly. &ldquo;The article is from the
pen of a thinker, a philosopher, a lover of mankind, a student, and a rhetorician of high
degree.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It must have been written by a syndicate,&rdquo; said Thacker. &ldquo;But, honestly, Colonel, you
want to go slow. I don&rsquo;t know of any eight- thousand-word single doses of written matter
that are read by anybody these days, except Supreme Court briefs and reports of murder
trials. You haven&rsquo;t by any accident gotten hold of a copy of one of Daniel Webster&rsquo;s speeches,
have you?&rdquo;
Colonel Telfair swung a little in his chair and looked steadily from under his bushy
eyebrows at the magazine promoter.
&ldquo;Mr. Thacker,&rdquo; he said, gravely, &ldquo;I am willing to segregate the somewhat crude
expression of your sense of humor from the solicitude that your business investments
undoubtedly have conferred upon you. But I must ask you to cease your jibes and
derogatory comments upon the South and the Southern people. They, sir, will not be
tolerated in the office of The Rose of Dixie for one moment. And before you proceed with
more of your covert insinuations that I, the editor of this magazine, am not a competent
judge of the merits of the matter submitted to its consideration, I beg that you will first
present some evidence or proof that you are my superior in any way, shape, or form relative
to the question in hand.&ldquo;&ldquo;Oh, come, Colonel,&rdquo; said Thacker, good-naturedly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything like that to you.
It sounds like an indictment by the fourth assistant attorney-general. Let&rsquo;s get back to
business. What&rsquo;s this 8,000 to 1 shot about?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The article,&rdquo; said Colonel Telfair, acknowledging the apology by a slight bow, &ldquo;covers a
wide area of knowledge. It takes up theories and questions that have puzzled the world for
centuries, and disposes of them logically and concisely. One by one it holds up to view the
evils of the world, points out the way of eradicating them; and then conscientiously and in
detail comments the good. There is hardly a phase of human life that it does not discuss
wisely, calmly, and equitably. The great policies of governments, the duties of private citizens,
the obligations of home life, law, ethics, morality&ndash;all these important subjects are handled
with a calm wisdom and confidence that I must confess has captured my admiration.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It must be a crackerjack,&rdquo; said Thacker, impressed.
&ldquo;It is a great contribution to the world&rsquo;s wisdom,&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;The only doubt
remaining in my mind as to the tremendous advantage it would be to us to give it
publication in The Rose of Dixie is that I have not yet sufficient information about the author
to give his work publicity in our magazine.
&ldquo;I thought you said he is a distinguished man,&rdquo; said Thacker.
&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; replied the colonel, &ldquo;both in literary and in other more diversified and
extraneous fields. But I am extremely careful about the matter that I accept for publication.
My contributors are people of unquestionable repute and connections, which fact can be
verified at any time. As I said, I am holding this article until I can acquire more information
about its author. I do not know whether I will publish it or not. If I decide against it, I shall be
much pleased, Mr. Thacker, to substitute the matter that you are leaving with me in its
place.&rdquo;
Thacker was somewhat at sea.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to gather,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;much about the gist of this inspired piece of
literature. It sounds more like a dark horse than Pegasus to me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is a human document,&rdquo; said the colonel-editor, confidently, &ldquo;from a man of great
accomplishments who, in my opinion, has obtained a stronger grasp on the world and its
outcomes than that of any man living to-day.&rdquo;
Thacker rose to his feet excitedly.
&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t possible that you&rsquo;ve cornered John D. Rockefeller&rsquo;s memoirs, is it?
Don&rsquo;t tell me that all at once.&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Colonel Telfair. &ldquo;I am speaking of mentality and literature not of the less
worthy intricacies of trade.&rdquo;
Well, what&rsquo;s the trouble about running the article,&rdquo; asked Thacker, a little impatiently,
&ldquo;if the man&rsquo;s well known and has got the stuff ?&rdquo; Colonel Telfair sighed.
&ldquo;Mr. Thacker,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for once I have been tempted. Nothing has yet appeared in The
Rose of Dixie that has not been from the pen of one of its sons or daughters. I know little
about the author of this article except that he has acquired prominence in a section of the
country that has always been inimical to my heart and mind. But I recognize his genius; and,
as I have told you, I have instituted an investigation of his personality. Perhaps it will be futile.
But I shall pursue the inquiry. Until that is finished, I must leave open the question of filling
the vacant space in our January number.&rdquo;
Thacker arose to leave.
&ldquo;All right, Colonel,&rdquo; he said, as cordially as he could. &ldquo;You use your own judgment. If
you&rsquo;ve really got a scoop or something that will make &lsquo;em sit up, run it instead of my stuff. I&rsquo;ll
drop in again in about two weeks. Good luck!&rdquo;
Colonel Telfair and the magazine promoter shook hands.
Returning a fortnight later, Thacker dropped off a very rocky Pullman at Toombs City. He
found the January number of the magazine made up and the forms closed.
The vacant space that had been yawning for type was filled by an article that was
headed thus:
SECOND MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
Written for
THE ROSE OF DIXIE
BY
A Member of the Well-known
BULLOCH FAMILY, OF GEORGIA
T. RooseveltRound The Circle （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>&ldquo;Find yo&rsquo; shirt all right, Sam?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Webber, from her chair under the live-oak,
where she was comfortably seated with a paper- back volume for company.
&ldquo;It balances perfeckly, Marthy,&rdquo; answered Sam, with a suspicious pleasantness in his
tone. &ldquo;At first I was about ter be a little reckless and kick &lsquo;cause ther buttons was all off, but
since I diskiver that the button holes is all busted out, why, I wouldn&rsquo;t go so fur as to say the
buttons is any loss to speak of.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said his wife, carelessly, &ldquo;put on your necktie&ndash;that&rsquo;ll keep it together.&rdquo;
Sam Webber&rsquo;s sheep ranch was situated in the loneliest part of the country between
the Nueces and the Frio. The ranch house&ndash;a two-room box structure&ndash;was on the rise of a
gently swelling hill in the midst of a wilderness of high chaparral. In front of it was a small
clearing where stood the sheep pens, shearing shed, and wool house. Only a few feet back
of it began the thorny jungle.
Sam was going to ride over to the Chapman ranch to see about buying some more
improved merino rams. At length he came out, ready for his ride. This being a business trip
of some importance, and the Chapman ranch being almost a small town in population and
size, Sam had decided to &ldquo;dress up&rdquo; accordingly. The result was that he had transformed
himself from a graceful, picturesque frontiersman into something much less pleasing to the
sight. The tight white collar awkwardly constricted his muscular, mahogany-colored neck.
The buttonless shirt bulged in stiff waves beneath his unbuttoned vest. The suit of
&ldquo;ready-made&rdquo; effectually concealed the fine lines of his straight, athletic figure. His
berry-brown face was set to the melancholy dignity befitting a prisoner of state. He gave
Randy, his three-year-old son, a pat on the head, and hurried out to where Mexico, his
favorite saddle horse, was standing.
Marthy, leisurely rocking in her chair, fixed her place in the book with her finger, and
turned her head, smiling mischievously as she noted the havoc Sam had wrought with his
appearance in trying to &ldquo;fix up.&rdquo;
~Well, ef I must say it, Sam,&rdquo; she drawled, &ldquo;you look jest like one of them hayseeds in
the picture papers, &lsquo;stead of a free and independent sheepman of the State o&rsquo; Texas.&rdquo;
Sam climbed awkwardly into the saddle.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one ought to be &lsquo;shamed to say so,&rdquo; he replied hotly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Stead of &lsquo;tendin&rsquo; to a
man&rsquo;s clothes you&rsquo;re al&rsquo;ays setting around a-readin&rsquo; them billy-by-dam yaller-back novils.&ldquo;&ldquo;Oh, shet up and ride along,&rdquo; said Mrs. Webber, with a little jerk at the handles of her
chair; &ldquo;you always fussin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout my readin&rsquo;. I do a-plenty; and I&rsquo;ll read when I wanter. I live in
the bresh here like a varmint, never seein&rsquo; nor hearin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;, and what other &lsquo;musement
kin I have? Not in listenin&rsquo; to you talk, for it&rsquo;s complain, complain, one day after another. Oh,
go on, Sam, and leave me in peace.&rdquo;
Sam gave his pony a squeeze with his knees and &ldquo;shoved&rdquo; down the wagon trail that
connected his ranch with the old, open Government road. It was eight o&rsquo;clock, and already
beginning to be very warm. He should have started three hours earlier. Chapman ranch was
only eighteen miles away, but there was a road for only three miles of the distance. He had
ridden over there once with one of the Half-Moon cowpunchers, and he had the direction
well-defined in his mind.
Sam turned off the old Government road at the split mesquite, and struck down the
arroyo of the Quintanilla. Here was a narrow stretch of smiling valley, upholstered with a
rich mat of green, curly mesquite grass; and Mexico consumed those few miles quickly with
his long, easy lope. Again, upon reaching Wild Duck Waterhole, must he abandon
well-defined ways. He turned now to his right up a little hill, pebble-covered, upon which
grew only the tenacious and thorny prickly pear and chaparral. At the summit of this he
paused to take his last general view of the landscape for, from now on, he must wind
through brakes and thickets of chaparral, pear, and mesquite, for the most part seeing
scarcely farther than twenty yards in any direction, choosing his way by the prairie-dweller&rsquo;s
instinct, guided only by an occasional glimpse of a far distant hilltop, a peculiarly shaped
knot of trees, or the position of the sun.
Sam rode down the sloping hill and plunged into the great pear flat that lies between
the Quintanilla and the Piedra.
In about two hours he discovered that he was lost. Then came the usual confusion of
mind and the hurry to get somewhere. Mexico was anxious to redeem the situation, twisting
with alacrity along the tortuous labyrinths of the jungle. At the moment his master&rsquo;s
sureness of the route had failed his horse had divined the fact. There were no hills now that
they could climb to obtain a view of the country. They came upon a few, but so dense and
interlaced was the brush that scarcely could a rabbit penetrate the mass. They were in the
great, lonely thicket of the Frio bottoms.
It was a mere nothing for a cattleman or a sheepman to be lost for a day or a night. The
thing often happened. It was merely a matter of missing a meal or two and sleeping
comfortably on your saddle blankets on a soft mattress of mesquite grass. But in Sam&rsquo;s case
it was different. He had never been away from his ranch at night. Marthy was afraid of the
country&ndash;afraid of Mexicans, of snakes, of panthers, even of sheep. So he had never left her
alone.It must have been about four in the afternoon when Sam&rsquo;s conscience awoke. He was
limp and drenched, rather from anxiety than the heat or fatigue. Until now he had been
hoping to strike the trail that led to the Frio crossing and the Chapman ranch. He must have
crossed it at some dim part of it and ridden beyond. If so he was now something like fifty
miles from home. If he could strike a ranch&ndash; a camp&ndash;any place where he could get a fresh
horse and inquire the road, he would ride all night to get back to Marthy and the kid.
So, I have hinted, Sam was seized bv remorse. There was a big lump in his throat as he
thought of the cross words he had spoken to his wife. Surely it was hard enough for her to
live in that horrible country witnout having to bear the burden of his abuse. He cursed
himself grimly, and felt a sudden flush of shame that over-glowed the summer heat as he
remembered the many times he had flouted and railed at her because she had a liking for
reading fiction.
&ldquo;Ther only so&rsquo;ce ov amusement ther po&rsquo; gal&rsquo;s got,&rdquo; said Sam aloud, with a sob, which
unaccustomed sound caused Mexico to shy a bit. A-livin with a sore-headed kiote like me&ndash;a
low-down skunk that ought to be licked to death with a saddle cinch&ndash;a-cookin&rsquo; and
a-washin&rsquo; and a-livin&rsquo; on mutton and beans and me abusin&rsquo; her fur takin&rsquo; a squint or two in a
little book!&rdquo;
He thought of Marthy as she had been when he first met her in Dogtown&ndash;smart, pretty,
and saucy&ndash;before the sun had turned the roses in her cheeks brown and the silence of the
chaparral had tamed her ambitions.
&ldquo;Ef I ever speaks another hard word to ther little gal,&rdquo; muttered Sam, &ldquo;or fails in the
love and affection that&rsquo;s coming to her in the deal, I hopes a wildcat&rsquo;ll t&rsquo;ar me to pieces.&rdquo;
He knew what he would do. He would write to Garcia &amp; Jones, his San Antonio
merchants where he bought his supplies and sold his wool, and have them send down a big
box of novels and reading matter for Marthy. Things were going to be different. He
wondered whether a little piano could be placed in one of the rooms of the ranch house
without the family having to move out of doors.
In nowise calculated to allay his self-reproach was the thought that Marthy and Randy
would have to pass the night alone. In spite of their bickerings, when night came Marthy was
wont to dismiss her fears of the country, and rest her head upon Sam&rsquo;s strong arm with a
sigh of peaceful content and dependence. And were her fears so groundless? Sam thought
of roving, marauding Mexicans, of stealthy cougars that sometimes invaded the ranches, of
rattlesnakes, centipedes, and a dozen possible dangers. Marthy would be frantic with fear.
Randy would cry, and call for dada to come.
Still the interminable succession of stretches of brush, cactus, and mesquite. Hollow
after hollow, slope after slope&ndash;all exactly alike &ndash;all familiar by constant repetition, and yet
all strange and new. If he could only arrive somewhere.The straight line is Art. Nature moves in circles. A straightforward man is more an
artificial product than a diplomatist is. Men lost in the snow travel in exact circles until they
sink, exhausted, as their footprints have attested. Also, travellers in philosophy and other
mental processes frequently wind up at their starting-point.
It was when Sam Webber was fullest of contrition and good resolves that Mexico, with
a heavy sigh, subsided from his regular, brisk trot into a slow complacent walk. They were
winding up an easy slope covered with brush ten or twelve feet high.
&ldquo;I say now, Mex,&rdquo; demurred Sam, &ldquo;this here won&rsquo;t do. I know you&rsquo;re plumb tired out,
but we got ter git along. Oh, Lordy, ain&rsquo;t there no mo&rsquo; houses in the world!&rdquo; He gave Mexico
a smart kick with his heels.
Mexico gave a protesting grunt as if to say: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of that, now we&rsquo;re so
near?&rdquo; He quickened his gait into a languid trot. Rounding a great clump of black chaparral
he stopped short. Sam dropped the bridle reins and sat, looking into the back door of his
own house, not ten yards away.
Marthy, serene and comfortable, sat in her rocking-chair before the door in the shade
of the house, with her feet resting luxuriously upon the steps. Randy, who was playing with a
pair of spurs on the ground, looked up for a moment at his father and went on spinning the
rowels and singing a little song. Marthy turned her head lazily against the back of the chair
and considered the arrivals with emotionless eyes. She held a book in her lap with her finger
holding the place.
Sam shook himself queerly, like a man coming out of a dream, and slowly dismounted.
He moistened his dry lips.
&ldquo;I see you are still a-settin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a-readin&rsquo; of them billy- by-dam yaller-back
novils.&rdquo;
Sam had traveled round the circle and was himself again.
The Rubber Plant&rsquo;s Story （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>We rubber plants form the connecting link between the vegetable kingdom and the
decorations of a Waldorf-Astoria scene in a Third Avenue theatre. I haven&rsquo;t looked up our
family tree, but I believe we were raised by grafting a gum overshoe on to a 30-cent table
d&rsquo;hote stalk of asparagus. You take a white bulldog with a Bourke Cockran air ofindependence about him and a rubber plant and there you have the fauna and flora of a flat.
What the shamrock is to Ireland the rubber plant is to the dweller in flats and furnished
rooms. We get moved from one place to another so quickly that the only way we can get our
picture taken is with a kinetoscope. We are the vagrant vine and the flitting fig tree. You
know the proverb: &ldquo;Where the rubber plant sits in the window the moving van draws up to
the door.&rdquo;
We are the city equivalent to the woodbine and the honeysuckle. No other vegetable
except the Pittsburg stogie can withstand as much handling as we can. When the family to
which we belong moves into a flat they set us in the front window and we become lares and
penates, fly-paper and the peripatetic emblem of &ldquo;Home Sweet Home.&rdquo; We aren&rsquo;t as green
as we look. I guess we are about what you would call the soubrettes of the conservatory. You
try sitting in the front window of a $40 flat in Manhattan and looking out into the street all
day, and back into the flat at night, and see whether you get wise or not&ndash;hey? Talk about
the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden&ndash;say! suppose there had been a
rubber plant there when Eve&ndash;but I was going to tell you a story.
The first thing I can remember I had only three leaves and belonged to a member of the
pony ballet. I was kept in a sunny window, and was generally watered with seltzer and lemon.
I had plenty of fun in those days. I got cross-eyed trying to watch the numbers of the
automobiles in the street and the dates on the labels inside at the same time.
Well, then the angel that was molting for the musical comedy lost his last feather and
the company broke up. The ponies trotted away and I was left in the window ownerless. The
janitor gave me to a refined comedy team on the eighth floor, and in six weeks I had been
set in the window of five different flats I took on experience and put out two more leaves.
Miss Carruthers, of the refined comedy team&ndash;did you ever see her cross both feet back
of her neck?&ndash;gave me to a friend of hers who had made an unfortunate marriage with a
man in a store. Consequently I was placed in the window of a furnished room, rent in
advance, water two flights up, gas extra after ten o&rsquo;clock at night. Two of my leaves withered
off here. Also, I was moved from one room to another so many times that I got to liking the
odor of the pipes the expressmen smoked.
I don&rsquo;t think I ever had so dull a time as I did with this lady. There was never anything
amusing going on inside&ndash;she was devoted to her husband, and, besides leaning out the
window and flirting with the iceman, she never did a thing toward breaking the monotony.
When the couple broke up they left me with the rest of their goods at a second-hand
store. I was put out in front for sale along with the jobbiest lot you ever heard of being
lumped into one bargain. Think of this little cornucopia of wonders, all for $1.89: Henry
James&rsquo;s works, six talking machine records, one pair of tennis shoes, two bottles of horse
radish, and a rubber plant&ndash;that was me!One afternoon a girl came along and stopped to look at me. She had dark hair and eyes,
and she looked slim, and sad around the mouth.
&ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; she says to herself. &ldquo;I never thought to see one up here.&rdquo;
She pulls out a little purse about as thick as one of my leaves and fingers over some
small silver in it. Old Koen, always on the lockout, is ready, rubbing his hands. This girl
proceeds to turn down Mr. James and the other commodities. Rubber plants or nothing is
the burden of her song. And at last Koen and she come together at 39 cents, and away she
goes with me in her arms.
She was a nice girl, but not my style. Too quiet and sober looking. Thinks I to myself: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
just about land on the fire-escape of a tenement, six stories up. And I&rsquo;ll spend the next six
months looking at clothes on the line.&rdquo;
But she carried me to a nice little room only three flights up in quite a decent street.
And she put me in the window, of course. And then she went to work and cooked dinner for
herself. And what do you suppose she had? Bread and tea and a little dab of jam! Nothing
else. Not a single lobster, nor so much as one bottle of champagne. The Carruthers comedy
team had both every evening, except now and then when they took a notion for pig&rsquo;s
knuckle and kraut.
After she had finished her dinner my new owner came to the window and leaned down
close to my leaves and cried softly to herself for a while. It made me feel funny. I never knew
anybody to cry that way over a rubber plant before. Of course, I&rsquo;ve seen a few of &lsquo;em turn on
the tears for what they could get out of it, but she seemed to be crying just for the pure
enjoyment of it. She touched my leaves like she loved &lsquo;em, and she bent down her head and
kissed each one of &lsquo;em. I guess I&rsquo;m about the toughest specimen of a peripatetic orchid on
earth, but I tell you it made me feel sort of queer. Home never was like that to me before.
Generally I used to get chewed by poodles and have shirt-waists hung on me to dry, and get
watered with coffee grounds and peroxide of hydrogen.
This girl had a piano in the room, and she used to disturb it with both hands while she
made noises with her mouth for hours at a time. I suppose she was practising vocal music.
One day she seemed very much excited and kept looking at the clock. At eleven
somebody knocked and she let in a stout, dark man with towsled black hair. He sat down at
once at the piano and played while she sang for him. When she finished she laid one hand
on her bosom and looked at him. He shook his head, and she leaned against the piano. &ldquo;Two
years already,&rdquo; she said, speaking slowly&ndash;&ldquo;do you think in two more&ndash;or even longer?&rdquo;
The man shook his head again. &ldquo;You waste your time,&rdquo; he said, roughly I thought. &ldquo;The
voice is not there.&rdquo; And then he looked at her in a peculiar way. &ldquo;But the voice is not
everything,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;You have looks. I can place you, as I told you if&ndash;&ldquo;The girl pointed to the door without saying anything, and the dark man left the room.
And then she came over and cried around me again. It&rsquo;s a good thing I had enough rubber in
me to be water-proof.
About that time somebody else knocked at the door. &ldquo;Thank goodness,&rdquo; I said to myself.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a chance to get the water-works turned off. I hope it&rsquo;s somebody that&rsquo;s game
enough to stand a bird and a bottle to liven things up a little.&rdquo; Tell you the truth, this little
girl made me tired. A rubber plant likes to see a little sport now and then. I don&rsquo;t suppose
there&rsquo;s another green thing in New York that sees as much of gay life unless it&rsquo;s the
chartreuse or the sprigs of parsley around the dish.
When the girl opens the door in steps a young chap in a traveling cap and picks her up
in his arms, and she sings out &ldquo;Oh, Dick!&rdquo; and stays there long enough to&ndash;well, you&rsquo;ve been
a rubber plant too, sometimes, I suppose.
&ldquo;Good thing!&rdquo; says I to myself. &ldquo;This is livelier than scales and weeping. Now there&rsquo;ll be
something doing.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to go back with me,&rdquo; says the young man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come two thousand miles
for you. Aren&rsquo;t you tired of it yet. Bess? You&rsquo;ve kept all of us waiting so long. Haven&rsquo;t you
found out yet what is best?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The bubble burst only to-day,&rdquo; says the girl. &ldquo;Come here, Dick, and see what I found
the other day on the sidewalk for sale.&rdquo; She brings him by the hand and exhibits yours truly.
&ldquo;How one ever got away up here who can tell? I bought it with almost the last money I had.&rdquo;
He looked at me, but he couldn&rsquo;t keep his eyes off her for more than a second. &ldquo;Do you
remember the night, Bess,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when we stood under one of those on the bank of the
bayou and what you told me then?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Geewillikins!&rdquo; I said to myself. &ldquo;Both of them stand under a rubber plant! Seems to me
they are stretching matters somewhat!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do I not,&rdquo; says she, looking up at him and sneaking close to his vest, &ldquo;and now I say it
again, and it is to last forever. Look, Dick, at its leaves, how wet they are. Those are my tears,
and it was thinking of you that made them fall.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The dear old magnolias!&rdquo; says the young man, pinching one of my leaves. &ldquo;I love them
all.&rdquo;
Magnolia! Well, wouldn&rsquo;t that&ndash;say! those innocents thought I was a magnolia! What
the&ndash;well, wasn&rsquo;t that tough on a genuine little old New York rubber plant?Rus in Urbe （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Considering men in relation to money, there are three kinds whom I dislike: men who
have more money than they can spend; men who have more money than they do spend;
and men who spend more money than they have. Of the three varieties, I believe I have the
least liking for the first. But, as a man, I liked Spencer Grenville North pretty well, although
he had something like two or ten or thirty millions&ndash; I&rsquo;ve forgotten exactly how many.
I did not leave town that summer. I usually went down to a village on the south shore of
Long Island. The place was surrounded by duck- farms, and the ducks and dogs and
whippoorwills and rusty windmills made so much noise that I could sleep as peacefully as if I
were in my own flat six doors from the elevated railroad in New York. But that summer I did
not go. Remember that. One of my friends asked me why I did not. I replied:
&ldquo;Because, old man, New York is the finest summer resort in the world.&rdquo; You have heard
that phrase before. But that is what I told him.
I was press-agent that year for Binkly &amp; Bing, the theatrical managers and producers. Of
course you know what a press-agent is. Well, he is not. That is the secret of being one.
Binkly was touring France in his new C. &amp; N. Williamson car, and Bing had gone to
Scotland to learn curling, which he seemed to associate in his mind with hot tongs rather
than with ice. Before they left they gave me June and July, on salary, for my vacation, which
act was in accord with their large spirit of liberality. But I remained in New York, which I had
decided was the finest summer resort in&ndash;
But I said that before.
On July the 10th, North came to town from his camp in the Adirondacks. Try to imagine
a camp with sixteen rooms, plumbing, eiderdown quilts, a butler, a garage, solid silver plate,
and a long-distance telephone. Of course it was in the woods&ndash;if Mr. Pinchot wants to
preserve the forests let him give every citizen two or ten or thirty million dollars, and the
trees will all gather around the summer camps, as the Birnam woods came to Dunsinane,
and be preserved.
North came to see me in my three rooms and bath, extra charge for light when used
extravagantly or all night. He slapped me on the back (I would rather have my shins kicked
any day), and greeted me with out-door obstreperousness and revolting good spirits. He was
insolently brown and healthy-looking, and offensively well dressed.&ldquo;Just ran down for a few days,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to sign some papers and stuff like that. My
lawyer wired me to come. Well, you indolent cockney, what are you doing in town? I took a
chance and telephoned, and they said you were here. What&rsquo;s the matter with that Utopia on
Long Island where you used to take your typewriter and your villanous temper every
summer? Anything wrong with the&ndash;er&ndash;swans, weren&rsquo;t they, that used to sing on the farms
at night?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ducks,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The songs of swans are for luckier ears. They swim and curve their
necks in artificial lakes on the estates of the wealthy to delight the eyes of the favorites of
Fortune.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Also in Central Park,&rdquo; said North, &ldquo;to delight the eyes of immigrants and bummers. I&rsquo;ve
seen em there lots of times. But why are you in the city so late in the summer?&rdquo;
&ldquo;New York City,&rdquo; I began to recite, &ldquo;is the finest sum&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said North, emphatically. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t spring that old one on me. I know
you know better. Man, you ought to have gone up with us this summer. The Prestons are
there, and Tom Volney and the Monroes and Lulu Stanford and the Miss Kennedy and her
aunt that you liked so well.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I never liked Miss Kennedy&rsquo;s aunt,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you did,&rdquo; said North. &ldquo;We are having the greatest time we&rsquo;ve ever had. The
pickerel and trout are so ravenous that I believe they would swallow your hook with a
Montana copper-mine prospectus fastened on it. And we&rsquo;ve a couple of electric launches;
and I&rsquo;ll tell you what we do every night or two&ndash;we tow a rowboat behind each one with a
big phonograph and a boy to change the discs in &lsquo;em. On the water, and twenty yards behind
you, they are not so bad. And there are passably good roads through the woods where we
go motoring. I shipped two cars up there. And the Pinecliff Inn is only three miles away. You
know the Pinecliff. Some good people are there this season, and we run over to the dances
twice a week. Can&rsquo;t you go back with me for a week, old man?&rdquo;
I laughed. &ldquo;Northy,&rdquo; said I&ndash;&ldquo;if I may be so familiar with a millionaire, because I hate
both the names Spencer and Grenville&ndash;your invitation is meant kindly, but&ndash;the city in the
summer-time for me. Here, while the bourgeoisie is away, I can live as Nero lived-barring,
thank heaven, the fiddling-while the city burns at ninety in the shade. The tropics and the
zones wait upon me like handmaidens. I sit under Florida palms and eat pomegranates while
Boreas himself, electrically conjured up, blows upon me his Arctic breath. As for trout, you
know, yourself, that Jean, at Maurice&rsquo;s, cooks them better than any one else in the world.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Be advised,&rdquo; said North. &ldquo;My chef has pinched the blue ribbon from the lot. He lays
some slices of bacon inside the trout, wraps it all in corn-husks&ndash;the husks of green corn, youknow&ndash;buries them in hot ashes and covers them with live coals. We build fires on the bank
of the lake and have fish suppers.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And the servants bring down tables and chairs and damask cloths, and
you eat with silver forks. I know the kind of camps that you millionaires have. And therc are
champagne pails set about, disgracing the wild flowers, and, no doubt, Madame Tetrazzini to
sing in the boat pavilion after the trout.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said North, concernedly, &ldquo;we were never as bad as that. We did have a variety
troupe up from the city three or four nights, but they weren&rsquo;t stars by as far as light can
travel in the same length of time. I always like a few home comforts even when I&rsquo;m roughing
it. But don&rsquo;t tell me you prefer to stay in the city during summer. I don&rsquo;t believe it. If you do,
why did you spend your summers there for the last four years, even sneaking away from
town on a night train, and refusing to tell your friends where this Arcadian village was?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they might have followed me and discovered it. But since then I have
learned that Amaryllis has come to town. The coolest things, the freshest, the brightest, the
choicest, are to be found in the city. If you&rsquo;ve nothing on hand this evening I will show you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m free,&rdquo; said North, &ldquo;and I have my light car outside. I suppose, since you&rsquo;ve been
converted to the town, that your idea of rural sport is to have a little whirl between bicycle
cops in Central Park and then a mug of sticky ale in some stuffy rathskeller under a fan that
can&rsquo;t stir up as many revolutions in a week as Nicaragua can in a day.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll begin with the spin through the Park, anyhow,&rdquo; I said. I was choking with the hot,
stale air of my little apartment, and I wanted that breath of the cool to brace me for the task
of proving to my friend that New York was the greatest&ndash;and so forth.
&ldquo;Where can you find air any fresher or purer than this?&rdquo; I asked, as we sped into
Central&rsquo;s boskiest dell.
&ldquo;Air!&rdquo; said North, contemptuously. &ldquo;Do you call this air?&ndash;this muggy vapor, smelling of
garbage and gasoline smoke. Man, I wish you could get one sniff of the real Adirondack
article in the pine woods at daylight.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have heard of it,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But for fragrance and tang and a joy in the nostrils I would
not give one puff of sea breeze across the bay, down on my little boat dock on Long Island,
for ten of your turpentine-scented tornadoes.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; asked North, a little curiously, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you go there instead of staying
cooped up in this Greater Bakery?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said I, doggedly, &ldquo;I have discovered that New York is the greatest summer&ndash;&rdquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that again,&rdquo; interrupted North, &ldquo;unless you&rsquo;ve actually got a job as General
Passenger Agent of the Subway. You can&rsquo;t really believe it.&rdquo;
I went to some trouble to try to prove my theory to my friend. The Weather Bureau and
the season had conspired to make the argument worthy of an able advocate.
The city seemed stretched on a broiler directly above the furnaces of Avernus. There
was a kind of tepid gayety afoot and awheel in the boulevards, mainly evinced by languid
men strolling about in straw hats and evening clothes, and rows of idle taxicabs with their
flags up, looking like a blockaded Fourth of July procession. The hotels kept up a specious
brilliancy and hospitable outlook, but inside one saw vast empty caverns, and the footrails at
the bars gleamed brightly from long disacquaintance with the sole-leather of customers. In
the cross-town streets the steps of the old brownstone houses were swarming with
&ldquo;stoopers,&rdquo; that motley race hailing from sky-light room and basement, bringing out their
straw doorstep mats to sit and fill the air with strange noises and opinions.
North and I dined on the top of a hotel; and here, for a few minutes, I thought I had
made a score. An east wind, almost cool, blew across the roofless roof. A capable orchestra
concealed in a bower of wistaria played with sufficient judgment to make the art of music
probable and the art of conversation possible.
Some ladies in reproachless summer gowns at other tables gave animation and color to
the scene. And an excellent dinner, mainly from the refrigerator, seemed to successfully back
my judgment as to summer resorts. But North grumbled all during the meal, and cursed his
lawyers and prated so of his confounded camp in the woods that I began to wish he would
go back there and leave me in my peaceful city retreat.
After dining we went to a roof-garden vaudeville that was being much praised. There
we found a good bill, an artificially cooled atmosphere, cold drinks, prompt service, and a
gay, well-dressed audience. North was bored.
&ldquo;If this isn&rsquo;t comfortable enough for you on the hottest August night for five years,&rdquo; I
said, a little sarcastically, &ldquo;you might think about the kids down in Delancey and Hester
streets lying out on the fire-escapes with their tongues hanging out, trying to get a breath of
air that hasn&rsquo;t been fried on both sides. The contrast might increase your enjoyment.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk Socialism,&rdquo; said North. &ldquo;I gave five hundred dollars to the free ice fund on
the first of May. I&rsquo;m contrasting these stale, artificial, hollow, wearisome &lsquo;amusements&rsquo; with
the enjoyment a man can get in the woods. You should see the firs and pines do skirtdances during a storm; and lie down flat and drink out of a mountain branch at the end of a
day&rsquo;s tramp after the deer. That&rsquo;s the only way to spend a summer. Get out and live with
nature.&ldquo;&ldquo;I agree with you absolutely,&rdquo; said I, with emphasis.
For one moment I had relaxed my vigilance, and had spoken my true sentiments. North
looked at me long and curiously.
&ldquo;Then why, in the name of Pan and Apollo,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;have you been singing this
deceitful paean to summer in town?&rdquo;
I suppose I looked my guilt.
&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; said North, &ldquo;I see. May I ask her name?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Annie Ashton,&rdquo; said I, simply. &ldquo;She played Nannette in Binkley &amp; Bing&rsquo;s production of
The Silver Cord. She is to have a better part next season.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Take me to see her,&rdquo; said North.
Miss Ashton lived with her mother in a small hotel. They were out of the West, and had
a little money that bridged the seasons. As press- agent of Binkley &amp; Bing I had tried to keep
her before the public. As Robert James Vandiver I had hoped to withdraw her; for if ever one
was made to keep company with said Vandiver and smell the salt breeze on the south shore
of Long Island and listen to the ducks quack in the watches of the night, it was the Ashton
set forth above.
But she had a soul above ducks&ndash;above nightingales; aye, even above birds of paradise.
She was very beautiful, with quiet ways, and seemed genuine. She had both taste and talent
for the stage, and she liked to stay at home and read and make caps for her mother. She was
unvaryingly kind and friendly with Binkley &amp; Bing&rsquo;s press-agent. Since the theatre had closed
she had allowed Mr. Vandiver to call in an unofficial role. I had often spoken to her of my
friend, Spencer Grenville North; and so, as it was early, the first turn of the vaudeville being
not yet over, we left to find a telephone.
Miss Ashton would be very glad to see Mr. Vandiver and Mr. North.
We found her fitting a new cap on her mother. I never saw her look more charming.
North made himself disagreeably entertaining. He was a good talker, and had a way
with him. Besides, he had two, ten, or thirty millions, I&rsquo;ve for gotten which. I incautiously
admired the mother&rsquo;s cap, whereupon she brought out her store of a dozen or two, and I
took a course in edgings and frills. Even though Annie&rsquo;s fingers had pinked, or ruched, or
hemmed, or whatever you do to &lsquo;em, they palled upon me. And I could hear North drivelling
to Annie about his odious Adirondack camp.Two days after that I saw North in his motor-car with Miss Ashton and her mother. On
the next afternoon he dropped in on me.
&ldquo;Bobby,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this old burg isn&rsquo;t such a bad proposition in the summer-time, after
all. Since I&rsquo;ve keen knocking around it looks better to me. There are some first-rate musical
comedies and light operas on the roofs and in the outdoor gardens. And if you hunt up the
right places and stick to soft drinks, you can keep about as cool here as you can in the
country. Hang it! when you come to think of it, there&rsquo;s nothing much to the country, anyhow.
You get tired and sunburned and lonesome, and you have to eat any old thing that the cook
dishes up to you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It makes a difference, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;It certainly does. Now, I found some whitebait yesterday, at Maurice&rsquo;s, with a new
sauce that beats anything in the trout line I ever tasted.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It makes a difference, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Immense. The sauce is the main thing with whitebait.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It makes a difference, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I asked, looking him straight in the eye. He
understood.
&ldquo;Look here, Bob,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was going to tell you. I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;ll play fair with
you, but I&rsquo;m going in to win. She is the &lsquo;one particular&rsquo; for me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fair field. There are no rights for you to encroach upon.&rdquo;
On Thursday afternoon Miss Ashton invited North and myself to have tea in her
apartment. He was devoted, and she was more charming than usual. By avoiding the subject
of caps I managed to get a word or two into and out of the talk. Miss Ashton asked me in a
make- conversational tone something about the next season&rsquo;s tour.
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. I&rsquo;m not going to be with Binkley &amp; Bing next
season.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, I thought,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that they were going to put the Number One road company
under your charge. I thought you told me so.&rdquo;
&ldquo;They were,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but they won&rsquo;t.. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;m going to do. I&rsquo;m going to the
south shore of Long Island and buy a small cottage I know there on the edge of the bay. And
I&rsquo;ll buy a catboat and a rowboat and a shotgun and a yellow dog. I&rsquo;ve got money enough to
do it. And I&rsquo;ll smell the salt wind all day when it blows from the sea and the pine odor when
it blows from the land. And, of course, I&rsquo;ll write plays until I have a trunk full of &lsquo;em on hand.&ldquo;And the next thing and the biggest thing I&rsquo;ll do will be to buy that duck-farm next door.
Few people understand ducks. I can watch &lsquo;em for hours. They can march better than any
company in the National Guard, and they can play &lsquo;follow my leader&rsquo; better than the entire
Democratic party. Their voices don&rsquo;t amount to much, but I like to hear &lsquo;em. They wake you
up a dozen times a night, but there&rsquo;s a homely sound about their quacking that is more
musical to me than the cry of &lsquo;Fresh strawber-rees!&rsquo; under your window in the morning
when you want to sleep.
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; I went on, enthusiastically, &ldquo;do you know the value of ducks besides their beauty
and intelligence and order and sweetness of voice? Picking their feathers gives you an
unfailing and never ceasing income. On a farm that I know the feathers were sold for $400 in
one year. Think of that! And the ones shipped to the market will bring in more money than
that. Yes, I am for the ducks and the salt breeze coming over the bay. I think I shall get a
Chinaman cook, and with him and the dog and the sunsets for company I shall do well. No
more of this dull, baking, senseless, roaring city for me.&rdquo;
Miss Ashton looked surprised. North laughed.
&ldquo;I am going to begin one of my plays tonight,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;so I must be going.&rdquo; And with that
I took my departure.
A few days later Miss Ashton telephoned to me, asking me to call at four in the
afternoon.
I did.
&ldquo;You have been very good to me,&rdquo; she said, hesitatingly, &ldquo;and I thought I would tell you.
I am going to leave the stage.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I suppose you will. They usually do when there&rsquo;s so much money.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There is no money,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or very little. Our money is almost gone.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But I am told,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that he has something like two or ten or thirty millions&ndash;I have
forgotten which.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will not pretend that I do not. I am not going to
marry Mr. North.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then why are you leaving the stage ?&rdquo; I asked, severely. &ldquo;What else can you do to earn
a living?&rdquo;
She came closer to me, and I can see the look in her eyes yet as she spoke.&ldquo;I can pick ducks,&rdquo; she said.
We sold the first year&rsquo;s feathers for $350.
A Sacrifice Hit （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The editor of the Hearthstone Magazine his own ideas about the selection of
manuscript for his publication. His theory is no secret; in fact, he will expound it to you
willingly sitting at his mahogany desk, smiling benignantly and tapping his knee gently with
his gold-rimmed eye- glasses.
&ldquo;The Hearthstone,&rdquo; he will say, &ldquo;does not employ a staff of readers. We obtain opinions
of the manuscripts submitted to us directly from types of the various classes of our readers.&rdquo;
That is the editor&rsquo;s theory; and this is the way he carries it out:
When a batch of MSS. is received the editor stuffs every one of his pockets full of them
and distributes them as he goes about during the day. The office employees, the hall porter,
the janitor, the elevator man, messenger boys, the waiters at the café where the editor has
luncheon, the man at the news-stand where he buys his evening paper, the grocer and
milkman, the guard on the 5.30 uptown elevated train, the ticket-chopper at Sixty &ndash;th street,
the cook and maid at his home &ndash; these are the readers who pass upon MSS. sent in to the
Hearthstone Magazine. If his pockets are not entirely emptied by the time he reaches the
bosom of his family the remaining ones are handed over to his wife to read after the baby
goes to sleep. A few days later the editor gathers in the MSS. during his regular rounds and
con- siders the verdict of his assorted readers.
This system of making up a magazine has been very successful; and the circulation,
paced by the advertising rates, is making a wonderful record of speed.
The Hearthstone Company also publishes books, and its imprint is to be found on
several successful works &ndash; all recommended, says the editor, by the Hearthstone&rsquo;8 army of
volunteer readers. Now and then (according to talkative members of the editorial staff) the
Hearthstone has allowed manuscripts to slip through its fingers on the advice of its
heterogeneous readers, that afterward proved to be famous sellers when brought out by
other houses.For instance (the gossips say), &ldquo;The Rise and Fall of Silas Latham&rdquo; was unfavourably
passed upon by the elevator-man; the office-boy unanimously rejected &ldquo;The Boss&rdquo;; &ldquo;In the
Bishop&rsquo;s Carriage&rdquo; was contemptuously looked upon by the street-car conductor; &ldquo;The
Deliver- ance&rdquo; was turned down by a clerk in the subscription department whose wife&rsquo;s
mother had just begun a two- months&rsquo; visit at his home; &ldquo;The Queen&rsquo;s Quair&rdquo; came back
from the janitor with the comment: &ldquo;So is the book.&rdquo;
But nevertheless the Hearthstone adheres to its theory and system, and it will never
lack volunteer readers; for each one of the widely scattered staff, from the young lady
stenographer in the editorial office to the man who shovels in coal (whose adverse decision
lost to the Hearth- stone Company the manuscript of &ldquo;The Under World&rdquo;), has expectations
of becoming editor of the magazine some day.
This method of the Hearthstone was well known to Allen Slayton when he wrote his
novelette entitled &ldquo;Love Is All.&rdquo; Slayton had hung about the editorial offices of all the
magazines so persistently that he was acquainted with the inner workings of every one in
Gotham.
He knew not only that the editor of the Hearthstone handed his MSS. around among
different types of people for reading, but that the stories of sentimental love- interest went
to Miss Puffkin, the editor&rsquo;s stenographer. Another of the editor&rsquo;s peculiar customs was to
conceal invariably the name of the writer from his readers of MSS. so that a glittering name
might not influence the sincerity of their reports.
Slayton made &ldquo;Love Is All&rdquo; the effort of his life. He gave it six months of the best work of
his heart and brain. It was a pure love-story, fine, elevated, romantic, passionate &ndash; a prose
poem that set the divine blessing of love (I am transposing from the manuscript) high above
all earthly gifts and honours, and listed it in the catalogue of heaven&rsquo;s choicest rewards.
Slayton&rsquo;s literary ambition was intense. He would have sacrificed all other worldly
possessions to have gained fame in his chosen art. He would almost have cut off his right
hand, or have offered himself to the knife of the appendi- citis fancier to have realized his
dream of seeing one of his efforts published in the Hearthstone.
Slayton finished &ldquo;Love Is All,&rdquo; and took it to thy Hearthstone in person. The office of the
magazine was in a large, conglomerate building, presided under by a janitor.
As the writer stepped inside the door on his way to the elevator a potato masher flew
through the hall, wreck- ing, Slayton&rsquo;s hat, and smashing the glass of the door. Closely
following in the wake of the utensil flew the janitor, a bulky, unwholesome man,
suspenderless and sordid, panic-stricken and breathless. A frowsy, tall woman with flying
hair followed the missile. The janitor&rsquo;s foot slipped on the tiled floor, he fell in a heap with
an exclamation of despair. The woman pounced upon him and seized his hair. The man
bellowed lustily.Her vengeance wreaked, the virago rose and stalked triumphant as Minerva, back to
some cryptic domestic retreat at the rear. The janitor got to his feet, blown and humiliated.
&ldquo;This is married life,&rdquo; he said to Slayton, with a certain bruised humour. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the girl I
used to lay awake of nights thinking about. Sorry about your hat, mister. Say, don&rsquo;t snitch to
the tenants about this, will yer? I don&rsquo;t want to lose me job.&rdquo;
Slayton took the elevator at the end of the hall and went up to the offices of the
Hearthstone. He left the MS. of &ldquo;Love Is All&rdquo; with the editor, who agreed to give, him an
answer as to its availability at the end of a week.
Slayton formulated his great winning scheme on his way down. It struck him with one
brilliant flash, and he could not refrain from admiring his own genius in conceiving the idea.
That very night he set about carry- ing it into execution.
Miss Puffkin, the Hearthstone stenographer, boarded in the same house with the
author. She was an oldish, thin, exclusive, languishing, sentimental maid; and Slayton had
been introduced to her some time before.
The writer&rsquo;s daring and self-sacrificing project was this: He knew that the editor of the
Hearthstone relied strongly upon Miss Puffkin&rsquo;s judgment in the manuscript of romantic and
sentimental fiction. Her taste represented the immense average of mediocre women who
devour novels and stories of that type. The central idea and keynote of &ldquo;Love Is All&rdquo; was love
at first sight &ndash; the enrapturing, irresistible, soul-thrilling, feeling that com- pels a man or a
woman to recognize his or her spirit-mate as soon as heart speaks to heart. Suppose he
should impress this divine truth upon Miss Puffkin personally! &ndash; would she not surely
indorse her new and rapturous sensations by recommending highly to the editor of the
Hearthstone the novelette &ldquo;Love Is All&rdquo; ?
Slayton thought so. And that night he took Miss Puffkin to the theatre. The next night
he made vehement love to her in the dim parlour of the boarding-house. He quoted freely
from &ldquo;Love Is All&rdquo;; and he wound up with Miss Puffkin&rsquo;s head on his shoulder, and visions of
literary fame dancing in his head.
But Slayton did not stop at love-making. This, he said to himself, was the turning point
of his life; and, like a true sportsman, he &ldquo;went the limit.&rdquo; On Thursday night he and Miss
Puffkin walked over to the Big Church in the Middle of the Block and were married.
Brave Slayton! Chateaubriand died in a garret, Byron courted a widow, Keats starved to
death, Poe mixed his drinks, De Quincey hit the pipe, Ade lived in Chica-o, James kept on
doing it, Dic Kens wore white socks, De Maupassant wore a strait-jacket, Tom Watson
became a Populist, Jeremiah wept, all these authors did these things for the sake of
literature, but thou didst cap them all; thou marriedst a wife for to carve for thyself a niche
in the temple of fame!On Friday morning Mrs. Slayton said she would go over to the Hearthstone office, hand
in one or two manu- ripts that the editor had given to her to read, and resign her position as
stenographer.
&ldquo;Was there anything &ndash; er &ndash; that &ndash; er &ndash; you particu- larly fancied in the stories you are
going to turn in?&rdquo; asked Slayton with a thumping heart.
&ldquo;There was one a novelette, that I liked so much,&rdquo; said his wife. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t read anything
in years that I thought was half as nice and true to life.&rdquo;
That afternoon Slayton hurried down to the Hearth- stone office. He felt that his reward
was close at hand. With a novelette in the Hearthstone, literary reputation would soon be
his.
The office boy met him at the railing in the outer office. It was not for unsuccessful
authors to hold personal colloquy with the editor except at rare intervals.
Slayton, hugging himself internally, was nursing in his heart the exquisite hope of being
able to crush the office boy with his forthcoming success.
He inquired concerning his novelette. The office boy went into the sacred precincts and
brought forth a large envelope, thick with more than the bulk of a thousand diecks.
&ldquo;The boss told me to tell you he&rsquo;s sorry,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;but your manuscript ain&rsquo;t
available for the magazine.&rdquo;
Slayton stood, dazed. &ldquo;Can you tell me,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;whether or no Miss Puff &ndash;
that is my &ndash; I mean Miss ruffkin &ndash; handed in a novelette this morning that she had been
asked to read?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sure she did,&rdquo; answered the office boy wisely. &ldquo;I heard the old man say that Miss
Puffkin said it was a daisy. The name of it was, &lsquo;Married for the Mazuma, or a Working Girl&rsquo;s
Triumph.&lsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Say, you!&rdquo; said the office boy confidentially, &ldquo;your name&rsquo;s Slayton, ain&rsquo;t it? I guess I
mixed cases on vou without meanin&rsquo; to do it. The boss give me some manu- script to hand
around the other day and I got the ones for Miss Puffkin and the janitor mixed. I guess it&rsquo;s all
right, though.&rdquo;
And then Slayton looked closer and saw on the cover of his manuscript, under the title
&ldquo;Love Is All,&rdquo; the janitor&rsquo;s comment scribbled with a piece of charcoal:
&ldquo;The &ndash; you say!&ldquo;Schools and Schools （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>I
Old Jerome Warren lived in a hundred-thousand-dollar house at 35 East Fifty-Soforth
Street. He was a down-town broker, so rich that he could afford to walk&ndash;for his health&ndash;a few
blocks in the direction of his office every morning, and then call a cab.
He had an adopted son, the son of an old friend named Gilbert&ndash;Cyril Scott could play
him nicely&ndash;who was becoming a successful painter as fast as he could squeeze the paint out
of his tubes. Another member of the household was Barbara Ross, a stepniece. Man is born
to trouble; so, as old Jerome had no family of his own, he took up the burdens of others.
Gilbert and Barbara got along swimmingly. There was a tacit and tactical understanding
all round that the two would stand up under a floral bell some high noon, and promise the
minister to keep old Jerome&rsquo;s money in a state of high commotion. But at this point
complications must be introduced.
Thirty years before, when old Jerome was young Jerome, there was a brother of his
named Dick. Dick went West to seek his or somebody else&rsquo;s fortune. Nothing was heard of
him until one day old Jerome had a letter from his brother. It was badly written on ruled
paper that smelled of salt bacon and coffee-grounds. The writing was asthmatic and the
spelling St. Vitusy.
It appeared that instead of Dick having forced Fortune to stand and deliver, he had been
held up himself, and made to give hostages to the enemy. That is, as his letter disclosed, he
was on the point of pegging out with a complication of disorders that even whiskey had
failed to check. All that his thirty years of prospecting had netted him was one daughter,
nineteen years old, as per invoice, whom he was shipping East, charges prepaid, for Jerome
to clothe, feed, educate, comfort, and cherish for the rest of her natural life or until
matrimony should them part.
Old Jerome was a board-walk. Everybody knows that the world is supported by the
shoulders of Atlas; and that Atlas stands on a rail- fence; and that the rail-fence is built on a
turtle&rsquo;s back. Now, the turtle has to stand on something; and that is a board-walk made of
men like old Jerome.
I do not know whether immortality shall accrue to man; but if not so, I would like to
know when men like old Jerome get what is due them?They met Nevada Warren at the station. She was a little girl, deeply sunburned and
wholesomely good-looking, with a manner that was frankly unsophisticated, yet one that
not even a cigar-drummer would intrude upon without thinking twice. Looking at her,
somehow you would expect to see her in a short skirt and leather leggings, shooting glass
balls or taming mustangs. But in her plain white waist and black skirt she sent you guessing
again. With an easy exhibition of strength she swung along a heavy valise, which the
uniformed porters tried in vain to wrest from her.
&ldquo;I am sure we shall be the best of friends,&rdquo; said Barbara, pecking at the firm, sunburned
cheek.
&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Nevada.
&ldquo;Dear little niece,&rdquo; said old Jerome, &ldquo;you are as welcome to my home as if it were your
father&rsquo;s own.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Nevada.
&ldquo;And I am going to call you &lsquo;cousin,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Gilbert, with his charming smile.
&ldquo;Take the valise, please,&rdquo; said Nevada. &ldquo;It weighs a million pounds. It&rsquo;s got samples from
six of dad&rsquo;s old mines in it,&rdquo; she explained to Barbara. &ldquo;I calculate they&rsquo;d assay about nine
cents to the thousand tons, but I promised him to bring them along.&rdquo;
II
It is a common custom to refer to the usual complication between one man and two
ladies, or one lady and two men, or a lady and a man and a nobleman, or&ndash;well, any of those
problems&ndash;as the triangle. But they are never unqualified triangles. They are always
isosceles&ndash;never equilateral. So, upon the coming of Nevada Warren, she and Gilbert and
Barbara Ross lined up into such a figurative triangle; and of that triangle Barbara formed the
hypotenuse.
One morning old Jerome was lingering long after breakfast over the dullest morning
paper in the city before setting forth to his down- town fly-trap. He had become quite fond
of Nevada, finding in her much of his dead brother&rsquo;s quiet independence and unsuspicious
frankness.
A maid brought in a note for Miss Nevada Warren.
&ldquo;A messenger-boy delivered it at the door, please,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s waiting for an
answer.&ldquo;Nevada, who was whistling a Spanish waltz between her teeth, and watching the
carriages and autos roll by in the street, took the envelope. She knew it was from Gilbert,
before she opened it, by the little gold palette in the upper left-hand corner.
After tearing it open she pored over the contents for a while, absorbedly. Then, with a
serious face, she went and stood at her uncle&rsquo;s elbow.
&ldquo;Uncle Jerome, Gilbert is a nice boy, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, bless the child!&rdquo; said old Jerome, crackling his paper loudly; &ldquo;of course he is. I
raised him myself.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t write anything to anybody that wasn&rsquo;t exactly&ndash;I mean that everybody
couldn&rsquo;t know and read, would he?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just like to see him try it,&rdquo; said uncle, tearing a handful from his newspaper. &ldquo;Why,
what&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Read this note he just sent me, uncle, and see if you think it&rsquo;s all right and proper. You
see, I don&rsquo;t know much about city people and their ways.&rdquo;
Old Jerome threw his paper down and set both his feet upon it. He took Gilbert&rsquo;s note
and fiercely perused it twice, and then a third time.
&ldquo;Why, child,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you had me almost excited, although I was sure of that boy. He&rsquo;s
a duplicate of his father, and he was a gilt-edged diamond. He only asks if you and Barbara
will be ready at four o&rsquo;clock this afternoon for an automobile drive over to Long Island. I
don&rsquo;t see anything to criticise in it except the stationery. I always did hate that shade of
blue.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Would it be all right to go?&rdquo; asked Nevada, eagerly.
&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes, child; of course. Why not? Still, it pleases me to see you so careful and
candid. Go, by all means.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Nevada, demurely. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d ask you. Couldn&rsquo;t you go with us,
uncle?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I? No, no, no, no! I&rsquo;ve ridden once in a car that boy was driving. Never again! But it&rsquo;s
entirely proper for you and Barbara to go. Yes, yes. But I will not. No, no, no, no!&rdquo;
Nevada flew to the door, and said to the maid:&ldquo;You bet we&rsquo;ll go. I&rsquo;ll answer for Miss Barbara. Tell the boy to say to Mr. Warren, &lsquo;You
bet we&rsquo;ll go.&lsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nevada,&rdquo; called old Jerome, &ldquo;pardon me, my dear, but wouldn&rsquo;t it be as well to send
him a note in reply? Just a line would do.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t bother about that,&rdquo; said Nevada, gayly. &ldquo;Gilbert will understand&ndash;he always
does. I never rode in an automobile in my life; but I&rsquo;ve paddled a canoe down Little Devil
River through the Lost Horse Canon, and if it&rsquo;s any livelier than that I&rsquo;d like to know!&rdquo;
III
Two months are supposed to have elapsed.
Barbara sat in the study of the hundred-thousand-dollar house. It was a good place for
her. Many places are provided in the world where men and women may repair for the
purpose of extricating themselves from divers difficulties. There are cloisters, wailing-places,
watering- places, confessionals, hermitages, lawyer&rsquo;s offices, beauty parlors, air-ships, and
studies; and the greatest of these are studies.
It usually takes a hypotenuse a long time to discover that it is the longest side of a
triangle. But it&rsquo;s a long line that has no turning.
Barbara was alone. Uncle Jerome and Nevada had gone to the theatre. Barbara had not
cared to go. She wanted to stay at home and study in the study. If you, miss, were a stunning
New York girl, and saw every day that a brown, ingenuous Western witch was getting
hobbles and a lasso on the young man you wanted for yourself, you, too, would lose taste
for the oxidized-silver setting of a musical comedy.
Barbara sat by the quartered-oak library table. Her right arm rested upon the table, and
her dextral fingers nervously manipulated a sealed letter. The letter was addressed to
Nevada Warren; and in the upper left-hand corner of the envelope was Gilbert&rsquo;s little gold
palette. It had been delivered at nine o&rsquo;clock, after Nevada had left.
Barbara would have given her pearl necklace to know what the letter contained; but
she could not open and read it by the aid of steam, or a pen-handle, or a hair-pin, or any of
the generally approved methods, because her position in society forbade such an act. She
had tried to read some of the lines of the letter by holding the envelope up to a strong light
and pressing it hard against the paper, but Gilbert had too good a taste in stationery to make
that possible.
At eleven-thirty the theatre-goers returned. it was a delicious winter night. Even so far
as from the cab to the door they were powdered thickly with the big flakes downpouring
diagonally from the cast. Old Jerome growled good-naturedly about villanous cab serviceand blockaded streets. Nevada, colored like a rose, with sapphire eyes, babbled of the
stormy nights in the mountains around dad&rsquo;s cabin. During all these wintry apostrophes,
Barbara, cold at heart, sawed wood&ndash;the only appropriate thing she could think of to do.
Old Jerome went immediately up-stairs to hot-water-bottles and quinine. Nevada
fluttered into the study, the only cheerfully lighted room, subsided into an arm-chair, and,
while at the interminable task of unbuttoning her elbow gloves, gave oral testimony as to
the demerits of the &ldquo;show.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, I think Mr. Fields is really amusing&ndash;sometimes,&rdquo; said Barbara. &ldquo;Here is a letter for
you, dear, that came by special delivery just after you had gone.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Who is it from?&rdquo; asked Nevada, tugging at a button.
&ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; said Barbara, with a smile, &ldquo;I can only guess. The envelope has that queer
little thing in one corner that Gilbert calls a palette, but which looks to me rather like a gilt
heart on a school- girl&rsquo;s valentine.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I wonder what he&rsquo;s writing to me about&rdquo; remarked Nevada, listlessly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all alike,&rdquo; said Barbara; &ldquo;all women. We try to find out what is in a letter by
studying the postmark. As a last resort we use scissors, and read it from the bottom upward.
Here it is.&rdquo;
She made a motion as if to toss the letter across the table to Nevada.
&ldquo;Great catamounts!&rdquo; exclaimed Nevada. &ldquo;These centre-fire buttons are a nuisance. I&rsquo;d
rather wear buckskins. Oh, Barbara, please shuck the hide off that letter and read it. It&rsquo;ll be
midnight before I get these gloves off!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, dear, you don&rsquo;t want me to open Gilbert&rsquo;s letter to you? It&rsquo;s for you, and you
wouldn&rsquo;t wish any one else to read it, of course!&rdquo;
Nevada raised her steady, calm, sapphire eyes from her gloves.
&ldquo;Nobody writes me anything that everybody mightn&rsquo;t read,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Go on, Barbara.
Maybe Gilbert wants us to go out in his car again to-morrow.&rdquo;
Curiosity can do more things than kill a cat; and if emotions, well recognized as
feminine, are inimical to feline life, then jealousy would soon leave the whole world catless.
Barbara opened the letter, with an indulgent, slightly bored air.
&ldquo;Well, dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read it if you want me to.&ldquo;She slit the envelope, and read the missive with swift-travelling eyes; read it again, and
cast a quick, shrewd glance at Nevada, who, for the time, seemed to consider gloves as the
world of her interest, and letters from rising artists as no more than messages from Mars.
For a quarter of a minute Barbara looked at Nevada with a strange steadfastness; and
then a smile so small that it widened her mouth only the sixteenth part of an inch, and
narrowed her eyes no more than a twentieth, flashed like an inspired thought across her
face.
Since the beginning no woman has been a mystery to another woman Swift as light
travels, each penetrates the heart and mind of another, sifts her sister&rsquo;s words of their
cunningest disguises, reads her most hidden desires, and plucks the sophistry from her
wiliest talk like hairs from a comb, twiddling them sardonically between her thumb and
fingers before letting them float away on the breezes of fundamental doubt. Long ago Eve&rsquo;s
son rang the door-bell of the family residence in Paradise Park, bearing a strange lady on his
arm, whom he introduced. Eve took her daughter-in-law aside and lifted a classic eyebrow.
&ldquo;The Land of Nod,&rdquo; said the bride, languidly flirting the leaf of a palm. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve
been there, of course?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not lately,&rdquo; said Eve, absolutely unstaggered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think the apple-sauce they
serve over there is execrable? I rather like that mulberry-leaf tunic effect, dear; but, of
course, the real fig goods are not to be had over there. Come over behind this lilac-bush
while the gentlemen split a celery tonic. I think the caterpillar-holes have made your dress
open a little in the back.&rdquo;
So, then and there&ndash;according to the records&ndash;was the alliance formed by the only two
who&rsquo;s-who ladies in the world. Then it was agreed that woman should forever remain as
clear as a pane of glass-though glass was yet to be discovered-to other women, and that she
should palm herself off on man as a mystery.
Barbara seemed to hesitate.
&ldquo;Really, Nevada,&rdquo; she said, with a little show of embarrassment, &ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t have
insisted on my opening this. I-I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t meant for any one else to know.&rdquo;
Nevada forgot her gloves for a moment.
&ldquo;Then read it aloud,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve already read it, what&rsquo;s the difference? If Mr.
Warren has written to me something that any one else oughtn&rsquo;t to know, that is all the more
reason why everybody should know it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Barbara, &ldquo;this is what it says:&lsquo;Dearest Nevada&ndash;Come to my studio at twelve o&rsquo;clock to-night. Do not fail.&lsquo;&rdquo; Barbara
rose and dropped the note in Nevada&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I knew. It isn&rsquo;t
like Gilbert. There must be some mistake. Just consider that I am ignorant of it, will you,
dear? I must go up-stairs now, I have such a headache. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t understand the note.
Perhaps Gilbert has been dining too well, and will explain. Good night!&rdquo;
IV
Nevada tiptoed to the hall, and heard Barbara&rsquo;s door close upstairs. The bronze clock in
the study told the hour of twelve was fifteen minutes away. She ran swiftly to the front door,
and let herself out into the snow-storm. Gilbert Warren&rsquo;s studio was six squares away.
By aerial ferry the white, silent forces of the storm attacked the city from beyond the
sullen East River. Already the snow lay a foot deep on the pavements, the drifts heaping
themselves like scaling- ladders against the walls of the besieged town. The Avenue was as
quiet as a street in Pompeii. Cabs now and then skimmed past like white-winged gulls over a
moonlit ocean; and less frequent motor-cars- -sustaining the comparison&ndash;hissed through
the foaming waves like submarine boats on their jocund, perilous journeys.
Nevada plunged like a wind-driven storm-petrel on her way. She looked up at the
ragged sierras of cloud-capped buildings that rose above the streets, shaded by the night
lights and the congealed vapors to gray, drab, ashen, lavender, dun, and cerulean tints. They
were so like the wintry mountains of her Western home that she felt a satisfaction such as
the hundred-thousand-dollar house had seldom brought her.
A policeman caused her to waver on a corner, just by his eye and weight.
&ldquo;Hello, Mabel!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Kind of late for you to be out, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&ndash;I am just going to the drug store,&rdquo; said Nevada, hurrying past him.
The excuse serves as a passport for the most sophisticated. Does it prove that woman
never progresses, or that she sprang from Adam&rsquo;s rib, full-fledged in intellect and wiles?
Turning eastward, the direct blast cut down Nevada&rsquo;s speed one-half. She made zigzag
tracks in the snow; but she was as tough as a pinon sapling, and bowed to it as gracefully.
Suddenly the studio-building loomed before her, a familiar landmark, like a cliff above some
well- remembered canon. The haunt of business and its hostile neighbor, art, was darkened
and silent. The elevator stopped at ten.
Up eight flights of Stygian stairs Nevada climbed, and rapped firmly at the door
numbered &ldquo;89.&rdquo; She had been there many times before, with Barbara and Uncle Jerome.Gilbert opened the door. He had a crayon pencil in one hand, a green shade over his
eyes, and a pipe in his mouth. The pipe dropped to the floor.
&ldquo;Am I late?&rdquo; asked Nevada. &ldquo;I came as quick as I could. Uncle and me were at the
theatre this evening. Here I am, Gilbert!&rdquo;
Gilbert did a Pygmalion-and-Galatea act. He changed from a statue of stupefaction to a
young man with a problem to tackle. He admitted Nevada, got a whiskbroom, and began to
brush the snow from her clothes. A great lamp, with a green shade, hung over an easel,
where the artist had been sketching in crayon.
&ldquo;You wanted me,&rdquo; said Nevada simply, &ldquo; and I came. You said so in your letter. What did
you send for me for?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You read my letter?&rdquo; inquired Gilbert, sparring for wind.
&ldquo;Barbara read it to me. I saw it afterward. It said: &lsquo;Come to my studio at twelve to-night,
and do not fail.&rsquo; I thought you were sick, of course, but you don&rsquo;t seem to be.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said Gilbert irrelevantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why I asked you to come, Nevada. I want
you to marry me immediately &ndash; to-night. What&rsquo;s a little snow-storm? Will you do it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You might have noticed that I would, long ago,&rdquo; said Nevada. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m rather stuck on
the snow-storm idea, myself. I surely would hate one of these flowery church
noon-weddings. Gilbert, I didn&rsquo;t know you had grit enough to propose it this way. Let&rsquo;s shock
&lsquo;em&ndash;it&rsquo;s our funeral, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; said Gilbert. &ldquo;Where did I hear that expression?&rdquo; he added to himself. &ldquo;Wait
a minute, Nevada; I want to do a little &lsquo;phoning.&rdquo;
He shut himself in a little dressing-room, and called upon the lightnings of tile
heavens&ndash;condensed into unromantic numbers and districts.
&ldquo;That you, Jack? You confounded sleepyhead! Yes, wake up; this is me&ndash;or I&ndash;oh, bother
the difference in grammar! I&rsquo;m going to be married right away. Yes! Wake up your
sister&ndash;don&rsquo;t answer me back; bring her along, too&ndash;you must!. Remind Agnes of the time I
saved her from drowning in Lake Ronkonkoma&ndash;I know it&rsquo;s caddish to refer to it, but she
must come with you. Yes. Nevada is here, waiting. We&rsquo;ve been engaged quite a while. Some
opposition among the relatives, you know, and we have to pull it off this way. We&rsquo;re waiting
here for you. Don&rsquo;t let Agnes out-talk you&ndash;bring her! You will? Good old boy! I&rsquo;ll order a
carriage to call for you, double-quick time. Confound you, Jack, you&rsquo;re all right!&rdquo;
Gilbert returned to the room where Nevada waited.&ldquo;My old friend, Jack Peyton, and his sister were to have been here at a quarter to
twelve,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;but Jack is so confoundedly slow. I&rsquo;ve just &lsquo;phoned them to hurry.
They&rsquo;ll be here in a few minutes. I&rsquo;m the happiest man in the world, Nevada! What did you
do with the letter I sent you to-day ?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it cinched here,&rdquo; said Nevada, pulling it out from beneath her opera-cloak.
Gilbert drew the letter from the envelope and looked it over carefully. Then he looked
at Nevada thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you think it rather queer that I should ask you to come to my studio at
midnight?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Nevada, rounding her eyes. &ldquo;Not if you needed me. Out West, when a
pal sends you a hurry call&ndash;ain&rsquo;t that what you say here ?&ndash;we get there first and talk about it
after the row is over. And it&rsquo;s usually snowing there, too, when things happen. So I didn&rsquo;t
mind.&rdquo;
Gilbert rushed into another room, and came back burdened with overcoats warranted
to turn wind, rain, or snow.
&ldquo;Put this raincoat on,&rdquo; he said, holding it for her. &ldquo;We have a quarter of a mile to go. Old
Jack and his sister will be here in a few minutes.&rdquo; He began to struggle into a heavy coat. &ldquo;Oh,
Nevada,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just look at the head-lines on the front page of that evening paper on the
table, will you? It&rsquo;s about your section of the West, and I know it will interest you.&rdquo;
He waited a full minute, pretending to find trouble in the getting on of his overcoat,
and then turned. Nevada had not moved. She was looking at him with strange and pensive
directness. Her cheeks had a flush on them beyond the color that had been contributed by
the wind and snow; but her eyes were steady.
&ldquo;I was going to tell you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;anyhow, before you&ndash;before we&ndash; before-well, before
anything. Dad never gave me a day of schooling. I never learned to read or write a darned
word. Now if&ndash;&rdquo; Pounding their uncertain way up-stairs, the feet of Jack, the somnolent, and
Agnes, the grateful, were heard.
V
When Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert Warren were spinning softly homeward in a closed carriage,
after the ceremony, Gilbert s said:
&ldquo;Nevada, would you really like to know what I wrote you in the letter that you received
to-night?&ldquo;&ldquo;Fire away!&rdquo; said his bride.
&ldquo;Word for word,&rdquo; said Gilbert, &ldquo;it was this: &lsquo;My dear Miss Warren-You were right about
the flower. It was a hydrangea, and not a lilac.&rsquo;
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Nevada. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s forget it. The joke&rsquo;s on Barbara, anyway!&rdquo;
Seats of the Haughty （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Golden by day and silver by night, a new trail now leads to us across the Indian Ocean.
Dusky kings and princes have found our Bombay of the West; and few be their trails that do
not lead down to Broadway on their journey for to admire and for to see.
If chance should ever lead you near a hotel that transiently shelters some one of these
splendid touring grandees, I counsel you to seek Lucullus Polk among the republican
tuft-hunters that besiege its entrances. He will be there. You will know him by his red, alert,
Wellington-nosed face, by his manner of nervous caution mingled with determination, by his
assumed promoter&rsquo;s or broker&rsquo;s air of busy impatience, and by his bright-red necktie,
gallantly redressing the wrongs of his maltreated blue serge suit, like a battle standard still
waving above a lost cause. I found him profitable; and so may you. When you do look for
him, look among the light-horse troop of Bedouins that besiege the picket-line of the
travelling potentate&rsquo;s guards and secretaries&ndash;among the wild-eyed genii of Arabian
Afternoons that gather to make astounding and egregrious demands upon the prince&rsquo;s
coffers.
I first saw Mr. Polk coming down the steps of the hotel at which sojourned His Highness
the Gaekwar of Baroda, most enlightened of the Mahratta princes, who, of late, ate bread
and salt in our Metropolis of the Occident.
Lucullus moved rapidly, as though propelled by some potent moral force that
imminently threatened to become physical. Behind him closely followed the impetus&ndash;a
hotel detective, if ever white Alpine hat, hawk&rsquo;s nose, implacable watch chain, and loud
refinement of manner spoke the truth. A brace of uniformed porters at his heels preserved
the smooth decorum of the hotel, repudiating by their air of disengagement any suspicion
that they formed a reserve squad of ejectment.
Safe on the sidewalk, Lucullus Polk turned and shook a freckled fist at the caravansary.
And, to my joy, he began to breathe deep invective in strange words:&ldquo;Rides in howdays, does he?&rdquo; he cried loudly and sneeringly. &ldquo;Rides on elephants in
howdahs and calls himself a prince! Kings&ndash;yah! Comes over here and talks horse till you
would think he was a president; and then goes home and rides in a private dining-room
strapped onto an elephant. Well, well, well!&rdquo;
The ejecting committee quietly retired. The scorner of princes turned to me and
snapped his fingers.
&ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; he shouted derisively. &ldquo;The Gaekwar of Baroda rides in an
elephant in a howdah! And there&rsquo;s old Bikram Shamsher Jang scorching up and down the
pig-paths of Khatmandu on a motor-cycle. Wouldn&rsquo;t that maharajah you? And the Shah of
Persia, that ought to have been Muley-on-the-spot for at least three, he&rsquo;s got the palanquin
habit. And that funny-hat prince from Korea&ndash;wouldn&rsquo;t you think he could afford to amble
around on a milk-white palfrey once in a dynasty or two? Nothing doing! His idea of a
Balaklava charge is to tuck his skirts under him and do his mile in six days over the hogwallows of Seoul in a bull-cart. That&rsquo;s the kind of visiting potentates that come to this
country now. It&rsquo;s a hard deal, friend.&rdquo;
I murmured a few words of sympathy. But it was uncomprehending, for I did not know
his grievance against the rulers who flash, meteor-like, now and then upon our shores.
&ldquo;The last one I sold,&rdquo; continued the displeased one, &ldquo;was to that three-horse-tailed
Turkish pasha that came over a year ago. Five hundred dollars he paid for it, easy. I says to
his executioner or secretary&ndash;he was a kind of a Jew or a Chinaman&ndash;&lsquo;His Turkey Gibbets is
fond of horses, then?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Him?&rsquo; says the secretary. &lsquo;Well, no. He&rsquo;s got a big, fat wife in the harem named Bad
Dora that he don&rsquo;t like. I believe he intends to saddle her up and ride her up and down the
board-walk in the Bulbul Gardens a few times every day. You haven&rsquo;t got a pair of extra-long
spurs you could throw in on the deal, have you?&rsquo; Yes, sir; there&rsquo;s mighty few real
rough-riders among the royal sports these days.&rdquo;
As soon as Lucullus Polk got cool enough I picked him up, and with no greater effort
than you would employ in persuading a drowning man to clutch a straw, I inveigled him into
accompanying me to a cool corner in a dim cafe.
And it came to pass that man-servants set before us brewage; and Lucullus Polk spake
unto me, relating the wherefores of his beleaguering the antechambers of the princes of the
earth.
&ldquo;Did you ever hear of the S.A. &amp; A.P. Railroad in Texas? Well, that don&rsquo;t stand for
Samaritan Actor&rsquo;s Aid Philanthropy. I was down that way managing a summer bunch of the
gum and syntax-chewers that play the Idlewild Parks in the Western hamlets. Of course, we
went to pieces when the soubrette ran away with a prominent barber of Beeville. I don&rsquo;tknow what became of the rest of the company. I believe there were some salaries due; and
the last I saw of the troupe was when I told them that forty-three cents was all the treasury
contained. I say I never saw any of them after that; but I heard them for about twenty
minutes. I didn&rsquo;t have time to look back. But after dark I came out of the woods and struck
the S.A. &amp; A.P. agent for means of transportation. He at once extended to me the courtesies
of the entire railroad, kindly warning me, however, not to get aboard any of the rolling stock.
&ldquo;About ten the next morning I steps off the ties into a village that calls itself Atascosa
City. I bought a thirty-cent breakfast and a ten-cent cigar, and stood on the Main Street
jingling the three pennies in my pocket&ndash;dead broke. A man in Texas with only three cents in
his pocket is no better off than a man that has no money and owes two cents.
&ldquo;One of luck&rsquo;s favourite tricks is to soak a man for his last dollar so quick that he don&rsquo;t
have time to look it. There I was in a swell St. Louis tailor-made, blue-and-green plaid suit,
and an eighteen- carat sulphate-of-copper scarf-pin, with no hope in sight except the two
great Texas industries, the cotton fields and grading new railroads. I never picked cotton, and
I never cottoned to a pick, so the outlook had ultramarine edges.
&ldquo;All of a sudden, while I was standing on the edge of the wooden sidewalk, down out of
the sky falls two fine gold watches in the middle of the street. One hits a chunk of mud and
sticks. The other falls hard and flies open, making a fine drizzle of little springs and screws
and wheels. I looks up for a balloon or an airship; but not seeing any, I steps off the sidewalk
to investigate.
&ldquo;But I hear a couple of yells and see two men running up the street in leather overalls
and high-heeled boots and cartwheel hats. One man is six or eight feet high, with
open-plumbed joints and a heartbroken cast of countenance. He picks up the watch that has
stuck in the mud. The other man, who is little, with pink hair and white eyes, goes for the
empty case, and says, &lsquo;I win.&rsquo; Then the elevated pessimist goes down under his leather
leg-holsters and hands a handful of twenty- dollar gold pieces to his albino friend. I don&rsquo;t
know how much money it was; it looked as big as an earthquake-relief fund to me.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have this here case filled up with works,&rsquo; says Shorty, &lsquo;and throw you again for five
hundred.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m your company,&rsquo; says the high man. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you at the Smoked Dog Saloon an
hour from now.&rsquo;
&ldquo;The little man hustles away with a kind of Swiss movement toward a jewelry store. The
heartbroken person stoops over and takes a telescopic view of my haberdashery.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Them&rsquo;s a mighty slick outfit of habiliments you have got on, Mr. Man,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bet
a hoss you never acquired the right, title, and interest in and to them clothes in Atascosa
City.&lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, no,&rsquo; says I, being ready enough to exchange personalities with this moneyed
monument of melancholy. &lsquo;I had this suit tailored from a special line of coatericks, vestures,
and pantings in St. Louis. Would you mind putting me sane,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;on this watch-throwing
contest? I&rsquo;ve been used to seeing time-pieces treated with more politeness and
esteem&ndash;except women&rsquo;s watches, of course, which by nature they abuse by cracking
walnuts with &lsquo;em and having &lsquo;em taken showing in tintype pictures.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Me and George,&rsquo; he explains, &lsquo;are up from the ranch, having a spell of fun. Up to last
month we owned four sections of watered grazing down on the San Miguel. But along
comes one of these oil prospectors and begins to bore. He strikes a gusher that flows out
twenty thousand &ndash;or maybe it was twenty million&ndash;barrels of oil a day. And me and George
gets one hundred and fifty thousand dollars&ndash;seventy-five thousand dollars apiece&ndash;for the
land. So now and then we saddles up and hits the breeze for Atascosa City for a few days of
excitement and damage. Here&rsquo;s a little bunch of the dinero that I drawed out of the bank
this morning,&rsquo; says he, and shows a roll of twenties and fifties as big around as a sleeping-car
pillow. The yellowbacks glowed like a sunset on the gable end of John D.&rsquo;s barn. My knees
got weak, and I sat down on the edge of the board sidewalk.
&ldquo;&lsquo;You must have knocked around a right smart,&rsquo; goes on this oil Grease-us. &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
be surprised if you have saw towns more livelier than what Atascosa City is. Sometimes it
seems to me that there ought to be some more ways of having a good time than there is
here, &lsquo;specially when you&rsquo;ve got plenty of money and don&rsquo;t mind spending it.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Then this Mother Cary&rsquo;s chick of the desert sits down by me and we hold a
conversationfest. It seems that he was money-poor. He&rsquo;d lived in ranch camps all his life; and
he confessed to me that his supreme idea of luxury was to ride into camp, tired out from a
round-up, eat a peck of Mexican beans, hobble his brains with a pint of raw whisky, and go
to sleep with his boots for a pillow. When this barge-load of unexpected money came to him
and his pink but perky partner, George, and they hied themselves to this clump of outhouses
called Atascosa City, you know what happened to them. They had money to buy anything
they wanted; but they didn&rsquo;t know what to want. Their ideas of spendthriftiness were
limited to three&ndash;whisky, saddles, and gold watches. If there was anything else in the world
to throw away fortunes on, they had never heard about it. So, when they wanted to have a
hot time, they&rsquo;d ride into town and get a city directory and stand in front of the principal
saloon and call up the population alphabetically for free drinks. Then they would order three
or four new California saddles from the storekeeper, and play crack-loo on the sidewalk with
twenty-dollar gold pieces. Betting who could throw his gold watch the farthest was an
inspiration of George&rsquo;s; but even that was getting to be monotonous.
&ldquo;Was I on to the opportunity? Listen.
&ldquo;In thirty minutes I had dashed off a word picture of metropolitan joys that made life in
Atascosa City look as dull as a trip to Coney Island with your own wife. In ten minutes morewe shook hands on an agreement that I was to act as his guide, interpreter and friend in and
to the aforesaid wassail and amenity. And Solomon Mills, which was his name, was to pay all
expenses for a month. At the end of that time, if I had made good as director-general of the
rowdy life, he was to pay me one thousand dollars. And then, to clinch the bargain, we
called the roll of Atascosa City and put all of its citizens except the ladies and minors under
the table, except one man named Horace Westervelt St. Clair. Just for that we bought a
couple of hatfuls of cheap silver watches and egged him out of town with &lsquo;em. We wound up
by dragging the harness-maker out of bed and setting him to work on three new saddles;
and then we went to sleep across the railroad track at the depot, just to annoy the S.A. &amp; A.P.
Think of having seventy- five thousand dollars and trying to avoid the disgrace of dying rich
in a town like that!
&ldquo;The next day George, who was married or something, started back to the ranch. Me
and Solly, as I now called him, prepared to shake off our moth balls and wing our way against
the arc-lights of the joyous and tuneful East.
&ldquo;&lsquo;No way-stops,&rsquo; says I to Solly, &lsquo;except long enough to get you barbered and
haberdashed. This is no Texas feet shampetter,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;where you eat
chili-concarne-con-huevos and then holler &ldquo;Whoopee!&rdquo; across the plaza. We&rsquo;re now going
against the real high life. We&rsquo;re going to mingle with the set that carries a Spitz, wears spats,
and hits the ground in high spots.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Solly puts six thousand dollars in century bills in one pocket of his brown ducks, and
bills of lading for ten thousand dollars on Eastern banks in another. Then I resume diplomatic
relations with the S.A. &amp; A.P., and we hike in a northwesterly direction on our circuitous
route to the spice gardens of the Yankee Orient.
&ldquo;We stopped in San Antonio long enough for Solly to buy some clothes, and eight
rounds of drinks for the guests and employees of the Menger Hotel, and order four Mexican
saddles with silver trimmings and white Angora suaderos to be shipped down to the ranch.
From there we made a big jump to St. Louis. We got there in time for dinner; and I put our
thumb-prints on the register of the most expensive hotel in the city.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; says I to Solly, with a wink at myself, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s the first dinner-station we&rsquo;ve struck
where we can get a real good plate of beans.&rsquo; And while he was up in his room trying to
draw water out of the gas-pipe, I got one finger in the buttonhole of the head waiter&rsquo;s
Tuxedo, drew him apart, inserted a two-dollar bill, and closed him up again.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Frankoyse,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I have a pal here for dinner that&rsquo;s been subsisting for years on
cereals and short stogies. You see the chef and order a dinner for us such as you serve to
Dave Francis and the general passenger agent of the Iron Mountain when they eat here.
We&rsquo;ve got more than Bernhardt&rsquo;s tent full of money; and we want the nose- bags crammed
with all the Chief Deveries de cuisine. Object is no expense. Now, show us.&lsquo;&ldquo;At six o&rsquo;clock me and Solly sat down to dinner. Spread! There&rsquo;s nothing been seen like
it since the Cambon snack. It was all served at once. The chef called it dinnay a la poker. It&rsquo;s a
famous thing among the gormands of the West. The dinner comes in threes of a kind. There
was guinea-fowls, guinea-pigs, and Guinness&rsquo;s stout; roast veal, mock turtle soup, and
chicken pate; shad-roe, caviar, and tapioca; canvas-back duck, canvas-back ham, and
cotton-tail rabbit; Philadelphia capon, fried snails, and sloe-gin&ndash;and so on, in threes. The
idea was that you eat nearly all you can of them, and then the waiter takes away the discard
and gives you pears to fill on.
&ldquo;I was sure Solly would be tickled to death with these hands, after the bobtail flushes
he&rsquo;d been eating on the ranch; and I was a little anxious that he should, for I didn&rsquo;t
remember his having honoured my efforts with a smile since we left Atascosa City.
&ldquo;We were in the main dining-room, and there was a fine-dressed crowd there, all
talking loud and enjoyable about the two St. Louis topics, the water supply and the colour
line. They mix the two subjects so fast that strangers often think they are discussing
water-colours; and that has given the old town something of a rep as an art centre. And over
in the corner was a fine brass band playing; and now, thinks I, Solly will become conscious of
the spiritual oats of life nourishing and exhilarating his system. But nong, mong frang.
&ldquo;He gazed across the table at me. There was four square yards of it, looking like the
path of a cyclone that has wandered through a stock- yard, a poultry-farm, a
vegetable-garden, and an Irish linen mill. Solly gets up and comes around to me.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Luke,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m pretty hungry after our ride. I thought you said they had some
beans here. I&rsquo;m going out and get something I can eat. You can stay and monkey with this
artificial layout of grub if you want to.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;I called the waiter, and slapped &rsquo;S. Mills&rsquo; on the back of the check for thirteen dollars
and fifty cents.
&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you mean,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;by serving gentlemen with a lot of truck only suitable for
deck-hands on a Mississippi steamboat? We&rsquo;re going out to get something decent to eat.&rsquo;
&ldquo;I walked up the street with the unhappy plainsman. He saw a saddle- shop open, and
some of the sadness faded from his eyes. We went in, and he ordered and paid for two more
saddles&ndash;one with a solid silver horn and nails and ornaments and a six-inch border of
rhinestones and imitation rubies around the flaps. The other one had to have a goldmounted horn, quadruple-plated stirrups, and the leather inlaid with silver beadwork
wherever it would stand it. Eleven hundred dollars the two cost him.&ldquo;Then he goes out and heads toward the river, following his nose. In a little side street,
where there was no street and no sidewalks and no houses, he finds what he is looking for.
We go into a shanty and sit on high stools among stevedores and boatmen, and eat beans
with tin spoons. Yes, sir, beans&ndash;beans boiled with salt pork.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I kind of thought we&rsquo;d strike some over this way,&rsquo; says Solly.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Delightful,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;That stylish hotel grub may appeal to some; but for me, give me
the husky /table d&rsquo;goat.&rsquo;
&ldquo;When we had succumbed to the beans I leads him out of the tarpaulin- steam under a
lamp post and pulls out a daily paper with the amusement column folded out.
&ldquo;&lsquo;But now, what ho for a merry round of pleasure,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s one of Hall Caine&rsquo;s
shows, and a stock-yard company in &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; and skating at the Hollowhorn Rink, and
Sarah Bernhardt, and the Shapely Syrens Burlesque Company. I should think, now, that the
Shapely&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;But what does this healthy, wealthy, and wise man do but reach his arms up to the
second-story windows and gape noisily.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Reckon I&rsquo;ll be going to bed,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s about my time. St. Louis is a kind of quiet
place, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;ever since the railroads ran in here the town&rsquo;s been practically ruined.
And the building-and-loan associations and the fair have about killed it. Guess we might as
well go to bed. Wait till you see Chicago, though. Shall we get tickets for the Big Breeze
to-morrow?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mought as well,&rsquo; says Solly. &lsquo;I reckon all these towns are about alike.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Well, maybe the wise cicerone and personal conductor didn&rsquo;t fall hard in Chicago!
Loolooville-on-the-Lake is supposed to have one or two things in it calculated to keep the
rural visitor awake after the curfew rings. But not for the grass-fed man of the pampas! I
tried him with theatres, rides in automobiles, sails on the lake, champagne suppers, and all
those little inventions that hold the simple life in check; but in vain. Solly grew sadder day by
day. And I got fearful about my salary, and knew I must play my trump card. So I mentioned
New York to him, and informed him that these Western towns were no more than gateways
to the great walled city of the whirling dervishes.
&ldquo;After I bought the tickets I missed Solly. I knew his habits by then; so in a couple of
hours I found him in a saddle-shop. They had some new ideas there in the way of trees and
girths that had strayed down from the Canadian mounted police; and Solly was so interested
that he almost looked reconciled to live. He invested about nine hundred dollars in there.&ldquo;At the depot I telegraphed a cigar-store man I knew in New York to meet me at the
Twenty-third Street ferry with a list of all the saddle-stores in the city. I wanted to know
where to look for Solly when he got lost.
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell you what happened in New York. I says to myself: &lsquo;Friend Heherezade, you
want to get busy and make Bagdad look pretty to the sad sultan of the sour countenance, or
it&rsquo;ll be the bowstring for yours.&rsquo; But I never had any doubt I could do it.
&ldquo;I began with him like you&rsquo;d feed a starving man. I showed him the horse-cars on
Broadway and the Staten Island ferry-boats. And then I piled up the sensations on him, but
always keeping a lot of warmer ones up my sleeve.
&ldquo;At the end of the third day he looked like a composite picture of five thousand
orphans too late to catch a picnic steamboat, and I was wilting down a collar every two
hours wondering how I could please him and whether I was going to get my thou. He went
to sleep looking at the Brooklyn Bridge; he disregarded the sky-scrapers above the third
story; it took three ushers to wake him up at the liveliest vaudeville in town.
&ldquo;Once I thought I had him. I nailed a pair of cuffs on him one morning before he was
awake; and I dragged him that evening to the palm-cage of one of the biggest hotels in the
city&ndash;to see the Johnnies and the Alice-sit-by-the-hours. They were out in numerous
quantities, with the fat of the land showing in their clothes. While we were looking them
over, Solly divested himself of a fearful, rusty kind of laugh&ndash;like moving a folding bed with
one roller broken. It was his first in two weeks, and it gave me hope.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Right you are,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re a funny lot of post-cards, aren&rsquo;t they?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of them dudes and culls on the hoof,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I was thinking of
the time me and George put sheep-dip in Horsehead Johnson&rsquo;s whisky. I wish I was back in
Atascosa City,&rsquo; says he.
&ldquo;I felt a cold chill run down my back. &lsquo;Me to play and mate in one move,&rsquo; says I to
myself.
&ldquo;I made Solly promise to stay in the cafe for half an hour and I hiked out in a cab to
Lolabelle Delatour&rsquo;s flat on Forty-third Street. I knew her well. She was a chorus-girl in a
Broadway musical comedy.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Jane,&rsquo; says I when I found her, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a friend from Texas here. He&rsquo;s all right,
but&ndash;well, he carries weight. I&rsquo;d like to give him a little whirl after the show this
evening&ndash;bubbles, you know, and a buzz out to a casino for the whitebait and pickled
walnuts. Is it a go?&lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;Can he sing?&rsquo; asks Lolabelle.
&ldquo;&lsquo;You know,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;that I wouldn&rsquo;t take him away from home unless his notes were
good. He&rsquo;s got pots of money&ndash;bean-pots full of it.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Bring him around after the second act,&rsquo; says Lolabelle, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll examine his credentials
and securities.&rsquo;
&ldquo;So about ten o&rsquo;clock that evening I led Solly to Miss Delatour&rsquo;s dressing-room, and her
maid let us in. In ten minutes in comes Lolabelle, fresh from the stage, looking stunning in
the costume she wears when she steps from the ranks of the lady grenadiers and says to the
king, &lsquo;Welcome to our May-day revels.&rsquo; And you can bet it wasn&rsquo;t the way she spoke the lines
that got her the part.
&ldquo;As soon as Solly saw her he got up and walked straight out through the stage entrance
into the street. I followed him. Lolabelle wasn&rsquo;t paying my salary. I wondered whether
anybody was.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Luke,&rsquo; says Solly, outside, &lsquo;that was an awful mistake. We must have got into the lady&rsquo;s
private room. I hope I&rsquo;m gentleman enough to do anything possible in the way of apologies.
Do you reckon she&rsquo;d ever forgive us?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;She may forget it,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Of course it was a mistake. Let&rsquo;s go find some beans.&rsquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it went. But pretty soon afterward Solly failed to show up at
dinner-time for several days. I cornered him. He confessed that he had found a restaurant on
Third Avenue where they cooked beans in Texas style. I made him take me there. The minute
I set foot inside the door I threw up my hands.
&ldquo;There was a young woman at the desk, and Solly introduced me to her. And then we
sat down and had beans.
&ldquo;Yes, sir, sitting at the desk was the kind of a young woman that can catch any man in
the world as easy as lifting a finger. There&rsquo;s a way of doing it. She knew. I saw her working it.
She was healthy-looking and plain dressed. She had her hair drawn back from her forehead
and face&ndash;no curls or frizzes; that&rsquo;s the way she looked. Now I&rsquo;ll tell you the way they work
the game; it&rsquo;s simple. When she wants a man, she manages it so that every time he looks at
her he finds her looking at him. That&rsquo;s all.
&ldquo;The next evening Solly was to go to Coney Island with me at seven. At eight o&rsquo;clock he
hadn&rsquo;t showed up. I went out and found a cab. I felt sure there was something wrong.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Drive to the Back Home Restaurant on Third Avenue,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;And if I don&rsquo;t find what I
want there, take in these saddle-shops.&rsquo; I handed him the list.&ldquo;&lsquo;Boss,&rsquo; says the cabby, &lsquo;I et a steak in that restaurant once. If you&rsquo;re real hungry, I
advise you to try the saddle-shops first.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m a detective,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and I don&rsquo;t eat. Hurry up!&rsquo;
&ldquo;As soon as I got to the restaurant I felt in the lines of my palms that I should beware of
a tall, red, damfool man, and I was going to lose a sum of money.
&ldquo;Solly wasn&rsquo;t there. Neither was the smooth-haired lady.
&ldquo;I waited; and in an hour they came in a cab and got out, hand in hand. I asked Solly to
step around the corner for a few words. He was grinning clear across his face; but I had not
administered the grin.
&ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s the greatest that ever sniffed the breeze,&rsquo; says he.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Congrats,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to have my thousand now, if you please.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Luke,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve had such a skyhoodlin&rsquo; fine time under
your tutelage and dispensation. But I&rsquo;ll do the best I can for you&ndash;I&rsquo;ll do the best I can,&rsquo; he
repeats. &lsquo;Me and Miss Skinner was married an hour ago. We&rsquo;re leaving for Texas in the
morning.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Great!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Consider yourself covered with rice and Congress gaiters. But don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s
tie so many satin bows on our business relations that we lose sight of &lsquo;em. How about my
honorarium?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Missis Mills,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;has taken possession of my money and papers except six bits. I
told her what I&rsquo;d agreed to give you; but she says it&rsquo;s an irreligious and illegal contract, and
she won&rsquo;t pay a cent of it. But I ain&rsquo;t going to see you treated unfair,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got
eighty-seven saddles on the ranch what I&rsquo;ve bought on this trip; and when I get back I&rsquo;m
going to pick out the best six in the lot and send &lsquo;em to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;And did he?&rdquo; I asked, when Lucullus ceased talking.
&ldquo;He did. And they are fit for kings to ride on. The six he sent me must have cost him
three thousand dollars. But where is the market for &lsquo;em? Who would buy one except one of
these rajahs and princes of Asia and Africa? I&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;em all on the list. I know every tan royal
dub and smoked princerino from Mindanao to the Caspian Sea.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long time between customers,&rdquo; I ventured.&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming faster,&rdquo; said Polk. &ldquo;Nowadays, when one of the murdering mutts gets
civilised enough to abolish suttee and quit using his whiskers for a napkin, he calls himself
the Roosevelt of the East, and comes over to investigate our Chautauquas and cocktails. I&rsquo;ll
place &lsquo;em all yet. Now look here.&rdquo;
From an inside pocket he drew a tightly folded newspaper with much- worn edges, and
indicated a paragraph.
&ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; said the saddler to royalty. The paragraph ran thus:
His Highness Seyyid Feysal bin Turkee, Imam of Muskat, is one of the most progressive
and enlightened rulers of the Old World. His stables contain more than a thousand horses of
the purest Persian breeds. It is said that this powerful prince contemplates a visit to the
United States at an early date.
&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Mr. Polk triumphantly. &ldquo;My best saddle is as good as sold&ndash;the one with
turquoises set in the rim of the cantle. Have you three dollars that you could loan me for a
short time?&rdquo;
It happened that I had; and I did.
If this should meet the eye of the Imam of Muskat, may it quicken his whim to visit the
land of the free! Otherwise I fear that I shall be longer than a short time separated from my
dollars three.
A Service of Love （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>When one loves one&rsquo;s Art no service seems too hard.
That is our premise. This story shall draw a conclusion from it, and show at the same
time that the premise is incorrect. That will be a new thing in logic, and a feat in story-telling
somewhat older than the great wall of China.
Joe Larrabee came out of the post-oak flats of the Middle West pulsing with a genius
for pictorial art. At six he drew a picture of the town pump with a prominent citizen passing
it hastily. This effort was framed and hung in the drug store window by the side of the ear of
corn with an uneven number of rows. At twenty he left for New York with a flowing necktie
and a capital tied up somewhat closer.Delia Caruthers did things in six octaves so promisingly in a pine- tree village in the
South that her relatives chipped in enough in her chip hat for her to go &ldquo;North&rdquo; and &ldquo;finish.&rdquo;
They could not see her f&ndash;, but that is our story.
Joe and Delia met in an atelier where a number of art and music students had gathered
to discuss chiaroscuro, Wagner, music, Rembrandt&rsquo;s works, pictures, Waldteufel, wall paper,
Chopin and Oolong.
Joe and Delia became enamoured one of the other, or each of the other, as you please,
and in a short time were married&ndash;for (see above), when one loves one&rsquo;s Art no service
seems too hard.
Mr. and Mrs. Larrabee began housekeeping in a flat. It was a lonesome flat&ndash;something
like the A sharp way down at the left-hand end of the keyboard. And they were happy; for
they had their Art, and they had each other. And my advice to the rich young man would
be&ndash;sell all thou hast, and give it to the poor&ndash;janitor for the privilege of living in a flat with
your Art and your Delia.
Flat-dwellers shall indorse my dictum that theirs is the only true happiness. If a home is
happy it cannot fit too close&ndash;let the dresser collapse and become a billiard table; let the
mantel turn to a rowing machine, the escritoire to a spare bedchamber, the washstand to an
upright piano; let the four walls come together, if they will, so you and your Delia are
between. But if home be the other kind, let it be wide and long&ndash;enter you at the Golden
Gate, hang your hat on Hatteras, your cape on Cape Horn and go out by the Labrador.
Joe was painting in the class of the great Magister&ndash;you know his fame. His fees are high;
his lessons are light&ndash;his high-lights have brought him renown. Delia was studying under
Rosenstock&ndash;you know his repute as a disturber of the piano keys.
They were mighty happy as long as their money lasted. So is every&ndash; but I will not be
cynical. Their aims were very clear and defined. Joe was to become capable very soon of
turning out pictures that old gentlemen with thin side-whiskers and thick pocketbooks
would sandbag one another in his studio for the privilege of buying. Delia was to become
familiar and then contemptuous with Music, so that when she saw the orchestra seats and
boxes unsold she could have sore throat and lobster in a private dining-room and refuse to
go on the stage.
But the best, in my opinion, was the home life in the little flat&ndash; the ardent, voluble
chats after the day&rsquo;s study; the cozy dinners and fresh, light breakfasts; the interchange of
ambitions&ndash;ambitions interwoven each with the other&rsquo;s or else inconsiderable&ndash;the mutual
help and inspiration; and&ndash;overlook my artlessness&ndash;stuffed olives and cheese sandwiches at
11 p.m.But after a while Art flagged. It sometimes does, even if some switchman doesn&rsquo;t flag it.
Everything going out and nothing coming in, as the vulgarians say. Money was lacking to pay
Mr. Magister and Herr Rosenstock their prices. When one loves one&rsquo;s Art no service seems
too hard. So, Delia said she must give music lessons to keep the chafing dish bubbling.
For two or three days she went out canvassing for pupils. One evening she came home
elated.
&ldquo;Joe, dear,&rdquo; she said, gleefully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a pupil. And, oh, the loveliest people!
General&ndash;General A. B. Pinkney&rsquo;s daughter&ndash;on Seventy-first street. Such a splendid house,
Joe&ndash;you ought to see the front door! Byzantine I think you would call it. And inside! Oh, Joe,
I never saw anything like it before.
&ldquo;My pupil is his daughter Clementina. I dearly love her already. She&rsquo;s a delicate
thing-dresses always in white; and the sweetest, simplest manners! Only eighteen years old.
I&rsquo;m to give three lessons a week; and, just think, Joe! $5 a lesson. I don&rsquo;t mind it a bit; for
when I get two or three more pupils I can resume my lessons with Herr Rosenstock. Now,
smooth out that wrinkle between your brows, dear, and let&rsquo;s have a nice supper.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right for you, Dele,&rdquo; said Joe, attacking a can of peas with a carving knife and
a hatchet, &ldquo;but how about me? Do you think I&rsquo;m going to let you hustle for wages while I
philander in the regions of high art? Not by the bones of Benvenuto Cellini! I guess I can sell
papers or lay cobblestones, and bring in a dollar or two.&rdquo;
Delia came and hung about his neck.
&ldquo;Joe, dear, you are silly. You must keep on at your studies. It is not as if I had quit my
music and gone to work at something else. While I teach I learn. I am always with my music.
And we can live as happily as millionaires on $15 a week. You mustn&rsquo;t think of leaving Mr.
Magister.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Joe, reaching for the blue scalloped vegetable dish. &ldquo;But I hate for you
to be giving lessons. It isn&rsquo;t Art. But you&rsquo;re a trump and a dear to do it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;When one loves one&rsquo;s Art no service seems too hard,&rdquo; said Delia.
&ldquo;Magister praised the sky in that sketch I made in the park,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;And Tinkle gave
me permission to hang two of them in his window. I may sell one if the right kind of a
moneyed idiot sees them.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you will,&rdquo; said Delia, sweetly. &ldquo;And now let&rsquo;s be thankful for Gen. Pinkney and
this veal roast.&ldquo;During all of the next week the Larrabees had an early breakfast. Joe was enthusiastic
about some morning-effect sketches he was doing in Central Park, and Delia packed him off
breakfasted, coddled, praised and kissed at 7 o&rsquo;clock. Art is an engaging mistress. It was most
times 7 o&rsquo;clock when he returned in the evening.
At the end of the week Delia, sweetly proud but languid, triumphantly tossed three
five-dollar bills on the 8x10 (inches) centre table of the 8x10 (feet) flat parlour.
Sometimes,&rdquo; she said, a little wearily, &ldquo;Clementina tries me. I&rsquo;m afraid she doesn&rsquo;t
practise enough, and I have to tell her the same things so often. And then she always
dresses entirely in white, and that does get monotonous. But Gen. Pinkney is the dearest old
man! I wish you could know him, Joe. He comes in sometimes when I am with Clementina at
the piano&ndash;he is a widower, you know&ndash;and stands there pulling his white goatee. &lsquo;And how
are the semiquavers and the demisemiquavers progressing?&rsquo; he always asks.
&ldquo;I wish you could see the wainscoting in that drawing-room, Joe! And those Astrakhan
rug portieres. And Clementina has such a funny little cough. I hope she is stronger than she
looks. Oh, I really am getting attached to her, she is so gentle and high bred. Gen. Pinkney&rsquo;s
brother was once Minister to Bolivia.&rdquo;
And then Joe, with the air of a Monte Cristo, drew forth a ten, a five, a two and a
one&ndash;all legal tender notes&ndash;and laid them beside Delia&rsquo;s earnings.
&ldquo;Sold that watercolour of the obelisk to a man from Peoria,&rdquo; he announced
overwhelmingly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t joke with me,&rdquo; said Delia, &ldquo;not from Peoria!&rdquo;
&ldquo;All the way. I wish you could see him, Dele. Fat man with a woollen muffler and a quill
toothpick. He saw the sketch in Tinkle&rsquo;s window and thought it was a windmill at first, he
was game, though, and bought it anyhow. He ordered another&ndash;an oil sketch of the
Lackawanna freight depot&ndash;to take back with him. Music lessons! Oh, I guess Art is still in it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve kept on,&rdquo; said Delia, heartily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bound to win, dear.
Thirty-three dollars! We never had so much to spend before. We&rsquo;ll have oysters to-night.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And filet mignon with champignons,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Were is the olive fork?&rdquo;
On the next Saturday evening Joe reached home first. He spread his $18 on the parlour
table and washed what seemed to be a great deal of dark paint from his hands.
Half an hour later Delia arrived, her right hand tied up in a shapeless bundle of wraps
and bandages.&ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; asked Joe after the usual greetings. Delia laughed, but not very joyously.
Clementina,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;insisted upon a Welsh rabbit after her lesson. She is such
a queer girl. Welsh rabbits at 5 in the afternoon. The General was there. You should have
seen him run for the chafing dish, Joe, just as if there wasn&rsquo;t a servant in the house. I know
Clementina isn&rsquo;t in good health; she is so nervous. In serving the rabbit she spilled a great lot
of it, boiling hot, over my hand and wrist. It hurt awfully, Joe. And the dear girl was so sorry!
But Gen. Pinkney!&ndash;Joe, that old man nearly went distracted. He rushed downstairs and sent
somebody&ndash;they said the furnace man or somebody in the basement&ndash;out to a drug store for
some oil and things to bind it up with. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt so much now.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked Joe, taking the hand tenderly and pulling at some white strands
beneath the bandages.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something soft,&rdquo; said Delia, &ldquo;that had oil on it. Oh, Joe, did you sell another
sketch?&rdquo; She had seen the money on the table.
&ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;just ask the man from Peoria. He got his depot to-day, and he isn&rsquo;t
sure but he thinks he wants another parkscape and a view on the Hudson. What time this
afternoon did you burn your hand, Dele?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Five o&rsquo;clock, I think,&rdquo; said Dele, plaintively. &ldquo;The iron&ndash;I mean the rabbit came off the
fire about that time. You ought to have seen Gen. Pinkney, Joe, when&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sit down here a moment, Dele,&rdquo; said Joe. He drew her to the couch, sat beside her and
put his arm across her shoulders.
&ldquo;What have you been doing for the last two weeks, Dele?&rdquo; he asked.
She braved it for a moment or two with an eye full of love and stubbornness, and
murmured a phrase or two vaguely of Gen. Pinkney; but at length down went her head and
out came the truth and tears.
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get any pupils,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;And I couldn&rsquo;t bear to have you give up your
lessons; and I got a place ironing shirts in that big Twentyfourth street laundry. And I think I
did very well to make up both General Pinkney and Clementina, don&rsquo;t you, Joe? And when a
girl in the laundry set down a hot iron on my hand this afternoon I was all the way home
making up that story about the Welsh rabbit. You&rsquo;re not angry, are you, Joe? And if I hadn&rsquo;t
got the work you mightn&rsquo;t have sold your sketches to that man from Peoria.
&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t from Peoria,&rdquo; said Joe, slowly.
&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where he was from. How clever you are, Joe &ndash;and&ndash;kiss me,
Joe&ndash;and what made you ever suspect that I wasn&rsquo;t giving music lessons to Clementina?&ldquo;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;until to-night. And I wouldn&rsquo;t have then, only I sent up this cotton
waste and oil from the engine-room this afternoon for a girl upstairs who had her hand
burned with a smoothing-iron. I&rsquo;ve been firing the engine in that laundry for the last two
weeks.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And then you didn&rsquo;t&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;My purchaser from Peoria,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;and Gen. Pinkney are both creations of the
same art&ndash;but you wouldn&rsquo;t call it either painting or music.
And then they both laughed, and Joe began:
&ldquo;When one loves one&rsquo;s Art no service seems&ndash;&rdquo;
But Delia stopped him with her hand on his lips. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said&ndash; &ldquo;just &lsquo;When one
loves.&lsquo;&rdquo;
Sisters of the Golden Circle （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The Rubberneck Auto was about ready to start. The merry top-riders had been assigned
to their seats by the gentlemanly conductor. The sidewalk was blockaded with sightseers
who had gathered to stare at sightseers, justifying the natural law that every creature on
earth is preyed upon by some other creature.
The megaphone man raised his instrument of torture; the inside of the great
automobile began to thump and throb like the heart of a coffee drinker. The top-riders
nervously clung to the seats; the old lady from Valparaiso, Indiana, shrieked to be put ashore.
But, before a wheel turns, listen to a brief preamble through the cardiaphone, which shall
point out to you an object of interest on life&rsquo;s sightseeing tour.
Swift and comprehensive is the recognition of white man for white man in African wilds;
instant and sure is the spiritual greeting between mother and babe; unhesitatingly do
master and dog commune across the slight gulf between animal and man; immeasurably
quick and sapient are the brief messages between one and one&rsquo;s beloved. But all these
instances set forth only slow and groping interchange of sympathy and thought beside one
other instance which the Rubberneck coach shall disclose. You shall learn (if you have not
learned already) what two beings of all earth&rsquo;s living inhabitants most quickly look into each
other&rsquo;s hearts and souls when they meet face to face.The gong whirred, and the Glaring-at-Gotham car moved majestically upon its
instructive tour.
On the highest, rear seat was James Williams, of Cloverdale, Missouri, and his Bride.
Capitalise it, friend typo&ndash;that last word&ndash;word of words in the epiphany of life and love.
The scent of the flowers, the booty of the bee, the primal drip of spring waters, the overture
of the lark, the twist of lemon peel on the cocktail of creation&ndash;such is the bride. Holy is the
wife; revered the mother; galliptious is the summer girl&ndash;but the bride is the certified check
among the wedding presents that the gods send in when man is married to mortality.
The car glided up the Golden Way. On the bridge of the great cruiser the captain stood,
trumpeting the sights of the big city to his passengers. Wide-mouthed and open-eared, they
heard the sights of the metropolis thundered forth to their eyes. Confused, delirious with
excitement and provincial longings, they tried to make ocular responses to the megaphonic
ritual. In the solemn spires of spreading cathedrals they saw the home of the Vanderbilts; in
the busy bulk of the Grand Central depot they viewed, wonderingly, the frugal cot of Russell
Sage. Bidden to observe the highlands of the Hudson, they gaped, unsuspecting, at the
upturned mountains of a new- laid sewer. To many the elevated railroad was the Rialto, on
the stations of which uniformed men sat and made chop suey of your tickets. And to this day
in the outlying districts many have it that Chuck Connors, with his hand on his heart, leads
reform; and that but for the noble municipal efforts of one Parkhurst, a district attorney, the
notorious &ldquo;Bishop&rdquo; Potter gang would have destroyed law and order from the Bowery to the
Harlem River.
But I beg you to observe Mrs. James Williams&ndash;Hattie Chalmers that was&ndash;once the belle
of Cloverdale. Pale-blue is the bride&rsquo;s, if she will; and this colour she had honoured. Willingly
had the moss rosebud loaned to her cheeks of its pink&ndash;and as for the violet!&ndash;her eyes will
do very well as they are, thank you. A useless strip of white chaf&ndash;oh, no, he was guiding the
auto car&ndash;of white chiffon&ndash;or perhaps it was grenadine or tulle&ndash;was tied beneath her chin,
pretending to hold her bonnet in place. But you know as well as I do that the hatpins did the
work.
And on Mrs. James Williams&rsquo;s face was recorded a little library of the world&rsquo;s best
thoughts in three volumes. Volume No. 1 contained the belief that James Williams was
about the right sort of thing. Volume No. 2 was an essay on the world, declaring it to be a
very excellent place. Volume No. 3 disclosed the belief that in occupying the highest seat in a
Rubberneck auto they were travelling the pace that passes all understanding.
James Williams, you would have guessed, was about twenty-four. It will gratify you to
know that your estimate was so accurate. He was exactly twenty-three years, eleven months
and twenty-nine days old. He was well built, active, strong-jawed, good-natured and rising.
He was on his wedding trip.Dear kind fairy, please cut out those orders for money and 40 H. P. touring cars and
fame and a new growth of hair and the presidency of the boat club. Instead of any of them
turn backward&ndash;oh, turn backward and give us just a teeny-weeny bit of our wedding trip
over again. Just an hour, dear fairy, so we can remember how the grass and poplar trees
looked, and the bow of those bonnet strings tied beneath her chin&ndash;even if it was the
hatpins that did the work. Can&rsquo;t do it? Very well; hurry up with that touring car and the oil
stock, then.
Just in front of Mrs. James Williams sat a girl in a loose tan jacket and a straw hat
adorned with grapes and roses. Only in dreams and milliners&rsquo; shops do we, alas! gather
grapes and roses at one swipe. This girl gazed with large blue eyes, credulous, when the
megaphone man roared his doctrine that millionaires were things about which we should be
concerned. Between blasts she resorted to Epictetian philosophy in the form of pepsin
chewing gum.
At this girl&rsquo;s right hand sat a young man about twenty-four. He was well-built, active,
strong-jawed and good-natured. But if his description seems to follow that of James
Williams, divest it of anything Cloverdalian. This man belonged to hard streets and sharp
corners. He looked keenly about him, seeming to begrudge the asphalt under the feet of
those upon whom he looked down from his perch.
While the megaphone barks at a famous hostelry, let me whisper you through the
low-tuned cardiaphone to sit tight; for now things are about to happen, and the great city
will close over them again as over a scrap of ticker tape floating down from the den of a
Broad street bear.
The girl in the tan jacket twisted around to view the pilgrims on the last seat. The other
passengers she had absorbed; the seat behind her was her Bluebeard&rsquo;s chamber.
Her eyes met those of Mrs. James Williams. Between two ticks of a watch they
exchanged their life&rsquo;s experiences, histories, hopes and fancies. And all, mind you, with the
eye, before two men could have decided whether to draw steel or borrow a match.
The bride leaned forward low. She and the girl spoke rapidly together, their tongues
moving quickly like those of two serpents&ndash; a comparison that is not meant to go further.
Two smiles and a dozen nods closed the conference.
And now in the broad, quiet avenue in front of the Rubberneck car a man in dark
clothes stood with uplifted hand. From the sidewalk another hurried to join him.
The girl in the fruitful hat quickly seized her companion by the arm and whispered in his
ear. That young man exhibited proof of ability to act promptly. Crouching low, he slid over
the edge of the car, hung lightly for an instant, and then disappeared. Half a dozen of the
top-riders observed his feat, wonderingly, but made no comment, deeming it prudent not toexpress surprise at what might be the conventional manner of alighting in this bewildering
city. The truant passenger dodged a hansom and then floated past, like a leaf on a stream
between a furniture van and a florist&rsquo;s delivery wagon.
The girl in the tan jacket turned again, and looked in the eyes of Mrs. James Williams.
Then she faced about and sat still while the Rubberneck auto stopped at the flash of the
badge under the coat of the plainclothes man.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; you?&rdquo; demanded the megaphonist, abandoning his professional
discourse for pure English.
&ldquo;Keep her at anchor for a minute,&rdquo; ordered the officer. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man on board we
want&ndash;a Philadelphia burglar called &lsquo;Pinky&rsquo; McGuire. There he is on the back seat. Look out
for the side, Donovan.&rdquo;
Donovan went to the hind wheel and looked up at James Williams.
&ldquo;Come down, old sport,&rdquo; he said, pleasantly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got you. Back to Sleepytown for
yours. It ain&rsquo;t a bad idea, hidin&rsquo; on a Rubberneck, though. I&rsquo;ll remember that.&rdquo;
Softly through the megaphone came the advice of the conductor:
&ldquo;Better step off, sir, and explain. The car must proceed on its tour.&rdquo;
James Williams belonged among the level heads. With necessary slowness he picked
his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front of the car. His wife followed,
but she first turned her eyes and saw the escaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van
and slip behind a tree on the edge of the little park, not fifty feet away.
Descended to the ground, James Williams faced his captors with a smile. He was
thinking what a good story he would have to tell in Cloverdale about having been mistaken
for a burglar. The Rubberneck coach lingered, out of respect for its patrons. What could be a
more interesting sight than this?
&ldquo;My name is James Williams, of Cloverdale, Missouri,&rdquo; he said kindly, so that they
would not be too greatly mortified. &ldquo;I have letters here that will show&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come with us, please,&rdquo; announced the plainclothes man. &ldquo;&lsquo;Pinky&rsquo; McGuire&rsquo;s
description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds. A detective saw you on the Rubberneck
up at Central Park and &lsquo;phoned down to take you in. Do your explaining at the stationhouse.&rdquo;
James Williams&rsquo;s wife&ndash;his bride of two weeks&ndash;looked him in the face with a strange,
soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks, looked him in the face and said:&ldquo;Go with &lsquo;em quietly, &lsquo;Pinky,&rsquo; and maybe it&rsquo;ll be in your favour.&rdquo;
And then as the Glaring-at-Gotham car rolled away she turned and threw a kiss&ndash;his
wife threw a kiss&ndash;at some one high up on the seats of the Rubberneck.
&ldquo;Your girl gives you good advice, McGuire,&rdquo; said Donovan. &ldquo;Come on, now.&rdquo;
And then madness descended upon and occupied James Williams. He pushed his hat
far upon the back of his head.
&ldquo;My wife seems to think I am a burglar,&rdquo; he said, recklessly. &ldquo;I never heard of her being
crazy; therefore I must be. And if I&rsquo;m crazy, they can&rsquo;t do anything to me for killing you two
fools in my madness.&rdquo;
Whereupon he resisted arrest so cheerfully and industriously that cops had to be
whistled for, and afterwards the reserves, to disperse a few thousand delighted spectators.
At the station-house the desk sergeant asked for his name.
&ldquo;McDoodle, the Pink, or Pinky the Brute, I forget which,&rdquo; was James Williams&rsquo;s answer.
&ldquo;But you can bet I&rsquo;m a burglar; don&rsquo;t leave that out. And you might add that it took five of
&lsquo;em to pluck the Pink. I&rsquo;d especially like to have that in the records.&rdquo;
In an hour came Mrs. James Williams, with Uncle Thomas, of Madison Avenue, in a
respect-compelling motor car and proofs of the hero&rsquo;s innocence&ndash;for all the world like the
third act of a drama backed by an automobile mfg. co.
After the police had sternly reprimanded James Williams for imitating a copyrighted
burglar and given him as honourable a discharge as the department was capable of, Mrs.
Williams rearrested him and swept him into an angle of the station-house. James Williams
regarded her with one eye. He always said that Donovan closed the other while somebody
was holding his good right hand. Never before had he given her a word of reproach or of
reproof.
&ldquo;If you can explain,&rdquo; he began rather stiffly, &ldquo;why you&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;listen. It was an hour&rsquo;s pain and trial to you. I did it for her&ndash;I
mean the girl who spoke to me on the coach. I was so happy, Jim&ndash;so happy with you that I
didn&rsquo;t dare to refuse that happiness to another. Jim, they were married only this morning
&ndash;those two; and I wanted him to get away. While they were struggling with you I saw him
slip from behind his tree and hurry across the park. That&rsquo;s all of it, dear&ndash;I had to do it.&ldquo;Thus does one sister of the plain gold band know another who stands in the enchanted
light that shines but once and briefly for each one. By rice and satin bows does mere man
become aware of weddings. But bride knoweth bride at the glance of an eye. And between
them swiftly passes comfort and meaning in a language that man and widows wot not of.
The Skylight Room （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>First Mrs. Parker would show you the double parlours. You would not dare to interrupt
her description of their advantages and of the merits of the gentleman who had occupied
them for eight years. Then you would manage to stammer forth the confession that you
were neither a doctor nor a dentist. Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s manner of receiving the admission was
such that you could never afterward entertain the same feeling toward your parents, who
had neglected to train you up in one of the professions that fitted Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s parlours.
Next you ascended one flight of stairs and looked at the second- floor-back at $8.
Convinced by her second-floor manner that it was worth the $12 that Mr. Toosenberry
always paid for it until he left to take charge of his brother&rsquo;s orange plantation in Florida
near Palm Beach, where Mrs. McIntyre always spent the winters that had the double front
room with private bath, you managed to babble that you wanted something still cheaper.
If you survived Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s scorn, you were taken to look at Mr. Skidder&rsquo;s large hall
room on the third floor. Mr. Skidder&rsquo;s room was not vacant. He wrote plays and smoked
cigarettes in it all day long. But every room-hunter was made to visit his room to admire the
lambrequins. After each visit, Mr. Skidder, from the fright caused by possible eviction, would
pay something on his rent.
Then&ndash;oh, then&ndash;if you still stood on one foot, with your hot hand clutching the three
moist dollars in your pocket, and hoarsely proclaimed your hideous and culpable poverty,
nevermore would Mrs. Parker be cicerone of yours. She would honk loudly the word&rdquo; Clara,&rdquo;
she would show you her back, and march downstairs. Then Clara, the coloured maid, would
escort you up the carpeted ladder that served for the fourth flight, and show you the
Skylight Room. It occupied 7x8 feet of floor space at the middle of the hall. On each side of it
was a dark lumber closet or storeroom.
In it was an iron cot, a washstand and a chair. A shelf was the dresser. Its four bare walls
seemed to close in upon you like the sides of a coffin. Your hand crept to your throat, you
gasped, you looked up as from a well&ndash;and breathed once more. Through the glass of the
little skylight you saw a square of blue infinity.
&ldquo;Two dollars, suh,&rdquo; Clara would say in her half-contemptuous, half- Tuskegeenial tones.One day Miss Leeson came hunting for a room. She carried a typewriter made to be
lugged around by a much larger lady. She was a very little girl, with eyes and hair that had
kept on growing after she had stopped and that always looked as if they were saying:
&ldquo;Goodness me ! Why didn&rsquo;t you keep up with us?&rdquo;
Mrs. Parker showed her the double parlours. &ldquo;In this closet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;one could keep
a skeleton or anaesthetic or coal &ldquo;
&ldquo;But I am neither a doctor nor a dentist,&rdquo; said Miss Leeson, with a shiver.
Mrs. Parker gave her the incredulous, pitying, sneering, icy stare that she kept for those
who failed to qualify as doctors or dentists, and led the way to the second floor back.
&ldquo;Eight dollars?&rdquo; said Miss Leeson. &ldquo;Dear me! I&rsquo;m not Hetty if I do look green. I&rsquo;m just a
poor little working girl. Show me something higher and lower.&rdquo;
Mr. Skidder jumped and strewed the floor with cigarette stubs at the rap on his door.
&ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Skidder,&rdquo; said Mrs. Parker, with her demon&rsquo;s smile at his pale looks. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know you were in. I asked the lady to have a look at your lambrequins.&rdquo;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re too lovely for anything,&rdquo; said Miss Leeson, smiling in exactly the way the
angels do.
After they had gone Mr. Skidder got very busy erasing the tall, black-haired heroine
from his latest (unproduced) play and inserting a small, roguish one with heavy, bright hair
and vivacious features.
&ldquo;Anna Held&rsquo;ll jump at it,&rdquo; said Mr. Skidder to himself, putting his feet up against the
lambrequins and disappearing in a cloud of smoke like an aerial cuttlefish.
Presently the tocsin call of &ldquo;Clara!&rdquo; sounded to the world the state of Miss Leeson&rsquo;s
purse. A dark goblin seized her, mounted a Stygian stairway, thrust her into a vault with a
glimmer of light in its top and muttered the menacing and cabalistic words &ldquo;Two dollars!&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it!&rdquo; sighed Miss Leeson, sinking down upon the squeaky iron bed.
Every day Miss Leeson went out to work. At night she brought home papers with
handwriting on them and made copies with her typewriter. Sometimes she had no work at
night, and then she would sit on the steps of the high stoop with the other roomers. Miss
Leeson was not intended for a sky-light room when the plans were drawn for her creation.
She was gay-hearted and full of tender, whimsical fancies. Once she let Mr. Skidder read to
her three acts of his great (unpublished) comedy, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s No Kid; or, The Heir of the Subway.&ldquo;There was rejoicing among the gentlemen roomers whenever Miss Leeson had time to
sit on the steps for an hour or two. But Miss Longnecker, the tall blonde who taught in a
public school and said, &ldquo;Well, really!&rdquo; to everything you said, sat on the top step and sniffed.
And Miss Dorn, who shot at the moving ducks at Coney every Sunday and worked in a
department store, sat on the bottom step and sniffed. Miss Leeson sat on the middle step
and the men would quickly group around her.
Especially Mr. Skidder, who had cast her in his mind for the star part in a private,
romantic (unspoken) drama in real life. And especially Mr. Hoover, who was forty-five, fat,
flush and foolish. And especially very young Mr. Evans, who set up a hollow cough to induce
her to ask him to leave off cigarettes. The men voted her &ldquo;the funniest and jolliest ever,&rdquo; but
the sniffs on the top step and the lower step were implacable.</p>

<hr />

<p>I pray you let the drama halt while Chorus stalks to the footlights and drops an
epicedian tear upon the fatness of Mr. Hoover. Tune the pipes to the tragedy of tallow, the
bane of bulk, the calamity of corpulence. Tried out, Falstaff might have rendered more
romance to the ton than would have Romeo&rsquo;s rickety ribs to the ounce. A lover may sigh,
but he must not puff. To the train of Momus are the fat men remanded. In vain beats the
faithfullest heart above a 52-inch belt. Avaunt, Hoover! Hoover, forty-five, flush and foolish,
might carry off Helen herself; Hoover, forty-five, flush, foolish and fat is meat for perdition.
There was never a chance for you, Hoover.
As Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s roomers sat thus one summer&rsquo;s evening, Miss Leeson looked up into
the firmament and cried with her little gay laugh:
&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s Billy Jackson! I can see him from down here, too.&rdquo;
All looked up&ndash;some at the windows of skyscrapers, some casting about for an airship,
Jackson-guided.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that star,&rdquo; explained Miss Leeson, pointing with a tiny finger. &ldquo;Not the big one that
twinkles&ndash;the steady blue one near it. I can see it every night through my skylight. I named it
Billy Jackson.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, really!&rdquo; said Miss Longnecker. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were an astronomer, Miss
Leeson.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the small star gazer, &ldquo;I know as much as any of them about the style of
sleeves they&rsquo;re going to wear next fall in Mars.&ldquo;&ldquo;Well, really!&rdquo; said Miss Longnecker. &ldquo;The star you refer to is Gamma, of the
constellation Cassiopeia. It is nearly of the second magnitude, and its meridian passage is&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the very young Mr. Evans, &ldquo;I think Billy Jackson is a much better name for it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; said Mr. Hoover, loudly breathing defiance to Miss Longnecker. &ldquo;I think
Miss Leeson has just as much right to name stars as any of those old astrologers had.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, really!&rdquo; said Miss Longnecker.
&ldquo;I wonder whether it&rsquo;s a shooting star,&rdquo; remarked Miss Dorn. &ldquo;I hit nine ducks and a
rabbit out of ten in the gallery at Coney Sunday.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t show up very well from down here,&rdquo; said Miss Leeson. &ldquo;You ought to see
him from my room. You know you can see stars even in the daytime from the bottom of a
well. At night my room is like the shaft of a coal mine, and it makes Billy Jackson look like the
big diamond pin that Night fastens her kimono with.&rdquo;
There came a time after that when Miss Leeson brought no formidable papers home to
copy. And when she went out in the morning, instead of working, she went from office to
office and let her heart melt away in the drip of cold refusals transmitted through insolent
office boys. This went on.
There came an evening when she wearily climbed Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s stoop at the hour when
she always returned from her dinner at the restaurant. But she had had no dinner.
As she stepped into the hall Mr. Hoover met her and seized his chance. He asked her to
marry him, and his fatness hovered above her like an avalanche. She dodged, and caught the
balustrade. He tried for her hand, and she raised it and smote him weakly in the face. Step
by step she went up, dragging herself by the railing. She passed Mr. Skidder&rsquo;s door as he was
red-inking a stage direction for Myrtle Delorme (Miss Leeson) in his (unaccepted) comedy, to
&ldquo;pirouette across stage from L to the side of the Count.&rdquo; Up the carpeted ladder she crawled
at last and opened the door of the skylight room.
She was too weak to light the lamp or to undress. She fell upon the iron cot, her fragile
body scarcely hollowing the worn springs. And in that Erebus of the skylight room, she
slowly raised her heavy eyelids, and smiled.
For Billy Jackson was shining down on her, calm and bright and constant through the
skylight. There was no world about her. She was sunk in a pit of blackness, with but that
small square of pallid light framing the star that she had so whimsically and oh, so
ineffectually named. Miss Longnecker must be right; it was Gamma, of the constellation
Cassiopeia, and not Billy Jackson. And yet she could not let it be Gamma.As she lay on her back she tried twice to raise her arm. The third time she got two thin
fingers to her lips and blew a kiss out of the black pit to Billy Jackson. Her arm fell back
limply.
&ldquo;Good-bye, Billy,&rdquo; she murmured faintly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re millions of miles away and you won&rsquo;t
even twinkle once. But you kept where I could see you most of the time up there when
there wasn&rsquo;t anything else but darkness to look at, didn&rsquo;t you? &hellip; Millions of miles&hellip; .
Good-bye, Billy Jackson.&rdquo;
Clara, the coloured maid, found the door locked at 10 the next day, and they forced it
open. Vinegar, and the slapping of wrists and burnt feathers proving of no avail, some one
ran to &lsquo;phone for an ambulance.
In due time it backed up to the door with much gong-clanging, and the capable young
medico, in his white linen coat, ready, active, confident, with his smooth face half debonair,
half grim, danced up the steps.
&ldquo;Ambulance call to 49,&rdquo; he said briefly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, yes, doctor,&rdquo; sniffed Mrs. Parker, as though her trouble that there should be
trouble in the house was the greater. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what can be the matter with her. Nothing
we could do would bring her to. It&rsquo;s a young woman, a Miss Elsie&ndash;yes, a Miss Elsie Leeson.
Never before in my house&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;What room?&rdquo; cried the doctor in a terrible voice, to which Mrs. Parker was a stranger.
&ldquo;The skylight room. It&ndash;
Evidently the ambulance doctor was familiar with the location of skylight rooms. He
was gone up the stairs, four at a time. Mrs. Parker followed slowly, as her dignity demanded.
On the first landing she met him coming back bearing the astronomer in his arms. He
stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his tongue, not loudly. Gradually Mrs. Parker
crumpled as a stiff garment that slips down from a nail. Ever afterward there remained
crumples in her mind and body. Sometimes her curious roomers would ask her what the
doctor said to her.
&ldquo;Let that be,&rdquo; she would answer. &ldquo;If I can get forgiveness for having heard it I will be
satisfied.&rdquo;
The ambulance physician strode with his burden through the pack of hounds that
follow the curiosity chase, and even they fell back along the sidewalk abashed, for his face
was that of one who bears his own dead.They noticed that he did not lay down upon the bed prepared for it in the ambulance
the form that he carried, and all that he said was: &ldquo;Drive like h**l, Wilson,&rdquo; to the driver.
That is all. Is it a story? In the next morning&rsquo;s paper I saw a little news item, and the last
sentence of it may help you (as it helped me) to weld the incidents together.
It recounted the reception into Bellevue Hospital of a young woman who had been
removed from No. 49 East &ndash; street, suffering from debility induced by starvation. It
concluded with these words:
&ldquo;Dr. William Jackson, the ambulance physician who attended the case, says the patient
will recover.&rdquo;
The Snow Man （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>EDITORIAL NOTE.&ndash;Before the fatal illness of William Sydney Porter (known through his
literary work as &ldquo;O. Henry&rdquo;) this American master of short-story writing had begun for
Hampton&rsquo;s Magazine the story printed below. Illness crept upon him rapidly and he was
compelled to give up writing about at the point where the girl enters the story.
When he realized that he could do no more (it was his lifelong habit to write with a
pencil, never dictating to a stenographer), O. Henry told in detail the remainder of The Snow
Man to Harris Merton Lyon, whom he had often spoken of as one of the most effective
short-story writers of the present time. Mr. Porter had delineated all of the characters,
leaving only the rounding out of the plot in the final pages to Mr. Lyon.
Housed and windowpaned from it, the greatest wonder to little children is the snow. To
men, it is something like a crucible in which their world melts into a white star ten million
miles away. The man who can stand the test is a Snow Man; and this is his reading by
Fahrenheit, Reaumur, or Moses&rsquo;s carven tablets of stone.
Night had fluttered a sable pinion above the canyon of Big Lost River, and I urged my
horse toward the Bay Horse Ranch because the snow was deepening. The flakes were as
large as an hour&rsquo;s circular tatting by Miss Wilkins&rsquo;s ablest spinster, betokening a heavy
snowfall and less entertainment and more adventure than the completion of the tatting
could promise. I knew Ross Curtis of the Bay Horse, and that I would be welcome as a
snow-bound pilgrim, both for hospitality&rsquo;s sake and because Ross had few chances to
confide in living creatures who did not neigh, bellow, bleat, yelp, or howl during his
discourse.The ranch house was just within the jaws of the canyon where its builder may have
fatuously fancied that the timbered and rocky walls on both sides would have protected it
from the wintry Colorado winds; but I feared the drift. Even now through the endless,
bottomless rift in the hills&ndash;the speaking tube of the four winds&ndash;came roaring the voice of
the proprietor to the little room on the top floor.
At my &ldquo;hello,&rdquo; a ranch hand came from an outer building and received my thankful
horse. In another minute, Ross and I sat by a stove in the dining-room of the four-room
ranch house, while the big, simple welcome of the household lay at my disposal. Fanned by
the whizzing norther, the fine, dry snow was sifted and bolted through the cracks and
knotholes of the logs. The cook room, without a separating door, appended.
In there I could see a short, sturdy, leisurely and weather-beaten man moving with
professional sureness about his red-hot stove. His face was stolid and
unreadable&ndash;something like that of a great thinker, or of one who had no thoughts to conceal.
I thought his eye seemed unwarrantably superior to the elements and to the man, but
quickly attributed that to the characteristic self-importance of a petty chef. &ldquo;Camp cook&rdquo; was
the niche that I gave him in the Hall of Types; and he fitted it as an apple fits a dumpling.
Cold it was in spite of the glowing stove; and Ross and I sat and talked, shuddering
frequently, half from nerves and half from the freezing draughts. So he brought the bottle
and the cook brought boiling water, and we made prodigious hot toddies against the attacks
of Boreas. We clinked glasses often. They sounded like icicles dropping from the eaves, or
like the tinkle of a thousand prisms on a Louis XIV chandelier that I once heard at a boarder&rsquo;s
dance in the parlor of a ten-a-week boarding-house in Gramercy Square. Sic transit.
Silence in the terrible beauty of the snow and of the Sphinx and of the stars; but they
who believe that all things, from a without-wine table d&rsquo;hote to the crucifixion, may be
interpreted through music, might have found a nocturne or a symphony to express the
isolation of that blotted-out world. The clink of glass and bottle, the aeolian chorus of the
wind in the house crannies, its deeper trombone through the canyon below, and the
Wagnerian crash of the cook&rsquo;s pots and pans, united in a fit, discordant melody, I thought.
No less welcome an accompaniment was the sizzling of broiling ham and venison cutlet
indorsed by the solvent fumes of true Java, bringing rich promises of comfort to our yearning
souls.
The cook brought the smoking supper to the table. He nodded to me democratically as
he cast the heavy plates around as though he were pitching quoits or hurling the discus. I
looked at him with some appraisement and curiosity and much conciliation. There was no
prophet to tell us when that drifting evil outside might cease to fall; and it is well, when
snow-bound, to stand somewhere within the radius of the cook&rsquo;s favorable consideration.
But I could read neither favor nor disapproval in the face and manner of our pot-wrestler.He was about five feet nine inches, and two hundred pounds of commonplace,
bull-necked, pink-faced, callous calm. He wore brown duck trousers too tight and too short,
and a blue flannel shirt with sleeves rolled above his elbows. There was a sort of grim,
steady scowl on his features that looked to me as though he had fixed it there purposely as a
protection against the weakness of an inherent amiability that, he fancied, were better
concealed. And then I let supper usurp his brief occupancy of my thoughts.
&ldquo;Draw up, George,&rdquo; said Ross. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all eat while the grub&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You fellows go on and chew,&rdquo; answered the cook. &ldquo;I ate mine in the kitchen before
sun-down.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Think it&rsquo;ll be a big snow, George?&rdquo; asked the ranchman.
George had turned to reenter the cook room. He moved slowly around and, looking at
his face, it seemed to me that he was turning over the wisdom and knowledge of centuries
in his head.
&ldquo;It might,&rdquo; was his delayed reply.
At the door of the kitchen he stopped and looked back at us. Both Ross and I held our
knives and forks poised and gave him our regard. Some men have the power of drawing the
attention of others without speaking a word. Their attitude is more effective than a shout.
&ldquo;And again it mightn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said George, and went back to his stove.
After we had eaten, he came in and gathered the emptied dishes. He stood for a
moment, while his spurious frown deepened.
&ldquo;It might stop any minute,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or it might keep up for days.&rdquo;
At the farther end of the cook room I saw George pour hot water into his dishpan, light
his pipe, and put the tableware through its required lavation. He then carefully unwrapped
from a piece of old saddle blanket a paperback book, and settled himself to read by his dim
oil lamp.
And then the ranchman threw tobacco on the cleared table and set forth again the
bottles and glasses; and I saw that I stood in a deep channel through which the long
dammed flood of his discourse would soon be booming. But I was half content, comparing
my fate with that of the late Thomas Tucker, who had to sing for his supper, thus doubling
the burdens of both himself and his host.
&ldquo;Snow is a hell of a thing,&rdquo; said Ross, by way of a foreword. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t, somehow, it seems
to me, salubrious. I can stand water and mud and two inches below zero and a hundred andten in the shade and medium-sized cyclones, but this here fuzzy white stuff naturally gets
me all locoed. I reckon the reason it rattles you is because it changes the look of things so
much. It&rsquo;s like you had a wife and left her in the morning with the same old blue cotton
wrapper on, and rides in of a night and runs across her all outfitted in a white silk evening
frock, waving an ostrich-feather fan, and monkeying with a posy of lily flowers. Wouldn&rsquo;t it
make you look for your pocket compass? You&rsquo;d be liable to kiss her before you collected your
presence of mind.&rdquo;
By and by, the flood of Ross&rsquo;s talk was drawn up into the clouds (so it pleased me to
fancy) and there condensed into the finer snowflakes of thought; and we sat silent about the
stove, as good friends and bitter enemies will do. I thought of Boss&rsquo;s preamble about the
mysterious influence upon man exerted by that ermine-lined monster that now covered our
little world, and knew he was right.
Of all the curious knickknacks, mysteries, puzzles, Indian gifts, rat-traps, and
well-disguised blessings that the gods chuck down to us from the Olympian peaks, the most
disquieting and evil-bringing is the snow. By scientific analysis it is absolute beauty and
purity &ndash;so, at the beginning we look doubtfully at chemistry.
It falls upon the world, and lo! we live in another. It hides in a night the old scars and
familiar places with which we have grown heart-sick or enamored. So, as quietly as we can,
we hustle on our embroidered robes and hie us on Prince Camaralzaman&rsquo;s horse or in the
reindeer sleigh into the white country where the seven colors converge. This is when our
fancy can overcome the bane of it.
But in certain spots of the earth comes the snow-madness, made known by people
turned wild and distracted by the bewildering veil that has obscured the only world they
know. In the cities, the white fairy who sets the brains of her dupes whirling by a wave of her
wand is cast for the comedy role. Her diamond shoe buckles glitter like frost; with a
pirouette she invites the spotless carnival.
But in the waste places the snow is sardonic. Sponging out the world of the outliers, it
gives no foothold on another sphere in return. It makes of the earth a firmament under foot;
it leaves us clawing and stumbling in space in an inimical fifth element whose evil outdoes
its strangeness and beauty, There Nature, low comedienne, plays her tricks on man. Though
she has put him forth as her highest product, it appears that she has fashioned him with
what seems almost incredible carelessness and indexterity. One-sided and without balance,
with his two halves unequally fashioned and joined, must he ever jog his eccentric way. The
snow falls, the darkness caps it, and the ridiculous man-biped strays in accurate circles until
he succumbs in the ruins of his defective architecture.
In the throat of the thirsty the snow is vitriol. In appearance as plausible as the
breakfast food of the angels, it is as hot in the mouth as ginger, increasing the pangs of the
water-famished. It is a derivative from water, air, and some cold, uncanny fire from whichthe caloric has been extracted. Good has been said of it; even the poets, crazed by its spell
and shivering in their attics under its touch, have indited permanent melodies
commemorative of its beauty.
Still, to the saddest overcoated optimist it is a plague&ndash;a corroding plague that Pharaoh
successfully side-stepped. It beneficently covers the wheat fields, swelling the crop&ndash;and the
Flour Trust gets us by the throat like a sudden quinsy. It spreads the tail of its white kirtle
over the red seams of the rugged north&ndash;and the Alaskan short story is born. Etiolated
perfidy, it shelters the mountain traveler burrowing from the icy air&ndash;and, melting to-morrow,
drowns his brother in the valley below.
At its worst it is lock and key and crucible, and the wand of Circe. When it corrals man
in lonely ranches, mountain cabins, and forest huts, the snow makes apes and tigers of the
hardiest. It turns the bosoms of weaker ones to glass, their tongues to infants&rsquo; rattles, their
hearts to lawlessness and spleen. It is not all from the isolation; the snow is not merely a
blockader; it is a Chemical Test. It is a good man who can show a reaction that is not chiefly
composed of a drachm or two of potash and magnesia, with traces of Adam, Ananias,
Nebuchadnezzar, and the fretful porcupine.
This is no story, you say; well, let it begin.
There was a knock at the door (is the opening not full of context and reminiscence oh,
best buyers of best sellers?).
We drew the latch, and in stumbled Etienne Girod (as he afterward named himself). But
just then he was no more than a worm struggling for life, enveloped in a killing white
chrysalis.
We dug down through snow, overcoats, mufflers, and waterproofs, and dragged forth a
living thing with a Van Dyck beard and marvellous diamond rings. We put it through the
approved curriculum of snow- rubbing, hot milk, and teaspoonful doses of whiskey, working
him up to a graduating class entitled to a diploma of three fingers of rye in half a glassful of
hot water. One of the ranch boys had already come from the quarters at Ross&rsquo;s bugle-like
yell and kicked the stranger&rsquo;s staggering pony to some sheltered corral where beasts were
entertained.
Let a paragraphic biography of Girod intervene.
Etienne was an opera singer originally, we gathered; but adversity and the snow had
made him non compos vocis. The adversity consisted of the stranded San Salvador Opera
Company, a period of hotel second- story work, and then a career as a professional palmist,
jumping from town to town. For, like other professional palmists, every time he worked the
Heart Line too strongly he immediately moved along the Line of Least Resistance. Though
Etienne did not confide this to us, we surmised that he had moved out into the dusk abouttwenty minutes ahead of a constable, and had thus encountered the snow. In his most
sacred blue language he dilated upon the subject of snow; for Etienne was Paris-born and
loved the snow with the same passion that an orchid does.
&ldquo;Mee-ser-rhable!&rdquo; commented Etienne, and took another three fingers.
&ldquo;Complete, cast-iron, pussy-footed, blank&hellip; blank!&rdquo; said Ross, and followed suit.
&ldquo;Rotten,&rdquo; said I.
The cook said nothing. He stood in the door weighing our outburst; and insistently from
behind that frozen visage I got two messages (via the M. A. M wireless). One was that
George considered our vituperation against the snow childish; the other was that George did
not love Dagoes. Inasmuch as Etienne was a Frenchman, I concluded I had the message
wrong. So I queried the other: &ldquo;Bright eyes, you don&rsquo;t really mean Dagoes, do you?&rdquo; and
over the wireless came three deathly, psychic taps: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Then I reflected that to George all
foreigners were probably &ldquo;Dagoes.&rdquo; I had once known another camp cook who had thought
Mons., Sig., and Millie (Trans-Mississippi for Mlle.) were Italian given names; this cook used
to marvel therefore at the paucity of Neo-Roman precognomens, and therefore why not&ndash;
I have said that snow is a test of men. For one day, two days, Etienne stood at the
window, Fletcherizing his finger nails and shrieking and moaning at the monotony. To me,
Etienne was just about as unbearable as the snow; and so, seeking relief, I went out on the
second day to look at my horse, slipped on a stone, broke my collarbone, and thereafter
underwent not the snow test, but the test of flat-on-the-back. A test that comes once too
often for any man to stand.
However, I bore up cheerfully. I was now merely a spectator, and from my couch in the
big room I could lie and watch the human interplay with that detached, impassive,
impersonal feeling which French writers tell us is so valuable to the litterateur, and American
writers to the faro-dealer.
&ldquo;I shall go crazy in this abominable, mee-ser-rhable place!&rdquo; was Etienne&rsquo;s constant
prediction.
&ldquo;Never knew Mark Twain to bore me before,&rdquo; said Ross, over and over. He sat by the
other window, hour after hour, a box of Pittsburg stogies of the length, strength, and odor of
a Pittsburg graft scandal deposited on one side of him, and &ldquo;Roughing It,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Jumping
Frog,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life on the Mississippi&rdquo; on the other. For every chapter he lit a new stogy,
puffing furiously. This in time, gave him a recurrent premonition of cramps, gastritis,
smoker&rsquo;s colic or whatever it is they have in Pittsburg after a too deep indulgence in graft
scandals. To fend off the colic, Ross resorted time and again to Old Doctor Still&rsquo;s
Amber-Colored U. S. A. Colic Cure. Result, after forty-eight hours&ndash;nerves.&ldquo;Positive fact I never knew Mark Twain to make me tired before. Positive fact.&rdquo; Ross
slammed &ldquo;Roughing It&rdquo; on the floor. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re snowbound this-away you want tragedy, I
guess. Humor just seems to bring out all your cussedness. You read a man&rsquo;s poor, pitiful
attempts to be funny and it makes you so nervous you want to tear the book up, get out
your bandana, and have a good, long cry.&rdquo;
At the other end of the room, the Frenchman took his finger nails out of his mouth long
enough to exclaim: &ldquo;Humor! Humor at such a time as thees! My God, I shall go crazy in thees
abominable&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Supper,&rdquo; announced George.
These meals were not the meals of Rabelais who said, &ldquo;the great God makes the
planets and we make the platters neat.&rdquo; By that time, the ranch-house meals were not
affairs of gusto; they were mental distraction, not bodily provender. What they were to be
later shall never be forgotten by Ross or me or Etienne.
After supper, the stogies and finger nails began again. My shoulder ached wretchedly,
and with half-closed eyes I tried to forget it by watching the deft movements of the stolid
cook.
Suddenly I saw him cock his ear, like a dog. Then, with a swift step, he moved to the
door, threw it open, and stood there.
The rest of us had heard nothing.
&ldquo;What is it, George?&rdquo; asked Ross.
The cook reached out his hand into the darkness alongside the jamb. With careful
precision he prodded something. Then he made one careful step into the snow. His back
muscles bulged a little under the arms as he stooped and lightly lifted a burden. Another
step inside the door, which he shut methodically behind him, and he dumped the burden at
a safe distance from the fire.
He stood up and fixed us with a solemn eye. None of us moved under that Orphic
suspense until,
&ldquo;A woman,&rdquo; remarked George.
Miss Willie Adams was her name. Vocation, school-teacher. Present avocation, getting
lost in the snow. Age, yum-yum (the Persian for twenty). Take to the woods if you would
describe Miss Adams. A willow for grace; a hickory for fibre; a birch for the clear whiteness
of her skin; for eyes, the blue sky seen through treetops; the silk in cocoons for her hair; her
voice, the murmur of the evening June wind in the leaves; her mouth, the berries of thewintergreen; fingers as light as ferns; her toe as small as a deer track. General impression
upon the dazed beholder&ndash;you could not see the forest for the trees.
Psychology, with a capital P and the foot of a lynx, at this juncture stalks into the ranch
house. Three men, a cook, a pretty young woman &ndash;all snowbound. Count me out of it, as I
did not count, anyway. I never did, with women. Count the cook out, if you like. But note the
effect upon Ross and Etienne Girod.
Ross dumped Mark Twain in a trunk and locked the trunk. Also, he discarded the
Pittsburg scandals. Also, he shaved off a three days&rsquo; beard.
Etienne, being French, began on the beard first. He pomaded it, from a little tube of
grease Hongroise in his vest pocket. He combed it with a little aluminum comb from the
same vest pocket. He trimmed it with manicure scissors from the same vest pocket. His light
and Gallic spirits underwent a sudden, miraculous change. He hummed a blithe San Salvador
Opera Company tune; he grinned, smirked, bowed, pirouetted, twiddled, twaddled, twisted,
and tooralooed. Gayly, the notorious troubadour, could not have equalled Etienne.
Ross&rsquo;s method of advance was brusque, domineering. &ldquo;Little woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
welcome here!&ldquo;&ndash;and with what he thought subtle double meaning&ndash;&ldquo;welcome to stay here
as long as you like, snow or no snow.&rdquo;
Miss Adams thanked him a little wildly, some of the wintergreen berries creeping into
the birch bark. She looked around hurriedly as if seeking escape. But there was none, save
the kitchen and the room allotted her. She made an excuse and disappeared into her own
room.
Later I, feigning sleep, heard the following:
&ldquo;Mees Adams, I was almost to perislh-die-of monotony w&rsquo;en your fair and beautiful
face appear in thees mee-ser-rhable house.&rdquo; I opened my starboard eye. The beard was
being curled furiously around a finger, the Svengali eye was rolling, the chair was being
hunched closer to the school-teacher&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I am French&ndash;you see&ndash;temperamental&ndash;nervous! I
cannot endure thees dull hours in thees ranch house; but&ndash;a woman comes! Ah!&rdquo; The
shoulders gave nine &lsquo;rahs and a tiger. &ldquo;What a difference! All is light and gay; ever&rsquo;ting smile
w&rsquo;en you smile. You have &lsquo;eart, beauty, grace. My &lsquo;eart comes back to me w&rsquo;en I feel your
&lsquo;eart. So!&rdquo; He laid his hand upon his vest pocket. From this vantage point he suddenly
snatched at the school-teacher&rsquo;s own hand, &ldquo;Ah! Mees Adams, if I could only tell you how I
ad&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dinner,&rdquo; remarked George. He was standing just behind the Frenchman&rsquo;s ear. His eyes
looked straight into the school-teacher&rsquo;s eyes. After thirty seconds of survey, his lips moved,
deep in the flinty, frozen maelstrom of his face: &ldquo;Dinner,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;will be ready in two
minutes.&ldquo;Miss Adams jumped to her feet, relieved. &ldquo;I must get ready for dinner,&rdquo; she said brightly,
and went into her room.
Ross came in fifteen minutes late. After the dishes had been cleaned away, I waited
until a propitious time when the room was temporarily ours alone, and told him what had
happened.
He became so excited that he lit a stogy without thinking. &ldquo;Yeller- hided, unwashed,
palm-readin&rsquo; skunk,&rdquo; he said under his breath. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shoot him full o&rsquo; holes if he don&rsquo;t watch
out&ndash;talkin&rsquo; that way to my wife!&rdquo;
I gave a jump that set my collarbone back another week. &ldquo;Your wife!&rdquo; I gasped.
&ldquo;Well, I mean to make her that,&rdquo; he announced.
The air in the ranch house the rest of that day was tense with pent-up emotions, oh,
best buyers of best sellers.
Ross watched Miss Adams as a hawk does a hen; he watched Etienne as a hawk does a
scarecrow, Etienne watched Miss Adams as a weasel does a henhouse. He paid no attention
to Ross.
The condition of Miss Adams, in the role of sought-after, was feverish. Lately escaped
from the agony and long torture of the white cold, where for hours Nature had kept the little
school-teacher&rsquo;s vision locked in and turned upon herself, nobody knows through what
profound feminine introspections she had gone. Now, suddenly cast among men, instead of
finding relief and security, she beheld herself plunged anew into other discomforts. Even in
her own room she could hear the loud voices of her imposed suitors. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll blow you full o&rsquo;
holes!&rdquo; shouted Ross. &ldquo;Witnesses,&rdquo; shrieked Etienne, waving his hand at the cook and me.
She could not have known the previous harassed condition of the men, fretting under
indoor conditions. All she knew was, that where she had expected the frank freemasonry of
the West, she found the subtle tangle of two men&rsquo;s minds, bent upon exacting whatever
romance there might be in her situation.
She tried to dodge Ross and the Frenchman by spells of nursing me. They also came
over to help nurse. This combination aroused such a natural state of invalid cussedness on
my part that they were all forced to retire. Once she did manage to whisper: &ldquo;I am so
worried here. I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;
To which I replied, gently, hitching up my shoulder, that I was a hunch-savant and that
the Eighth House under this sign, the Moon being in Virgo, showed that everything would
turn out all right.But twenty minutes later I saw Etienne reading her palm and felt that perhaps I might
have to recast her horoscope, and try for a dark man coming with a bundle.
Toward sunset, Etienne left the house for a few moments and Ross, who had been
sitting taciturn and morose, having unlocked Mark Twain, made another dash. It was typical
Ross talk.
He stood in front of her and looked down majestically at that cool and perfect spot
where Miss Adams&rsquo; forehead met the neat part in her fragrant hair. First, however, he cast a
desperate glance at me. I was in a profound slumber.
&ldquo;Little woman,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s certainly tough for a man like me to see you bothered
this way. You&rdquo;&ndash;gulp&ndash;&ldquo;you have been alone in this world too long. You need a protector. I
might say that at a time like this you need a protector the worst kind&ndash;a protector who
would take a three-ring delight in smashing the saffron-colored kisser off of any
yeller-skinned skunk that made himself obnoxious to you. Hem. Hem. I am a lonely man,
Miss Adams. I have so far had to carry on my life without the&rdquo;&ndash;gulp&ndash;&ldquo;sweet
radiance&rdquo;&ndash;gulp&ndash;&ldquo;of a woman around the house. I feel especially doggoned lonely at a time
like this, when I am pretty near locoed from havin&rsquo; to stall indoors, and hence it was with
delight I welcomed your first appearance in this here shack. Since then I have been packed
jam full of more different kinds of feelings, ornery, mean, dizzy, and superb, than has fallen
my way in years.&rdquo;
Miss Adams made a useless movement toward escape. The Ross chin stuck firm. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to annoy you, Miss Adams, but, by heck, if it comes to that you&rsquo;ll have to be
annoyed. And I&rsquo;ll have to have my say. This palm-ticklin&rsquo; slob of a Frenchman ought to be
kicked off the place and if you&rsquo;ll say the word, off he goes. But I don&rsquo;t want to do the wrong
thing. You&rsquo;ve got to show a preference. I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; around to the point, Miss&ndash;Miss Willie, in
my own brick fashion. I&rsquo;ve stood about all I can stand these last two days and somethin&rsquo;s got
to happen. The suspense hereabouts is enough to hang a sheepherder. Miss Willie&rdquo;&ndash;he
lassooed her hand by main force&ndash;&ldquo;just say the word. You need somebody to take your part
all your life long. Will you mar&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Supper,&rdquo; remarked George, tersely, from the kitchen door.
Miss Adams hurried away.
Ross turned angrily. &ldquo;You&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have been revolving it in my head,&rdquo; said George.
He brought the coffee pot forward heavily. Then bravely the big platter of pork and
beans. Then somberly the potatoes. Then profoundly the biscuits. &ldquo;I have been revolving it
in my mind. There ain&rsquo;t no use waitin&rsquo; any longer for Swengalley. Might as well eat now.&ldquo;&gt;From my excellent vantage-point on the couch I watched the progress of that meal.
Ross, muddled, glowering, disappointed; Etienne, eternally blandishing, attentive, ogling;
Miss Adams, nervous, picking at her food, hesitant about answering questions, almost
hysterical; now and then the solid, flitting shadow of the cook, passing behind their backs
like a Dreadnaught in a fog.
I used to own a clock which gurgled in its throat three minutes before it struck the hour.
I know, therefore, the slow freight of Anticipation. For I have awakened at three in the
morning, heard the clock gurgle, and waited those three minutes for the three strokes I
knew were to come. Alors. In Ross&rsquo;s ranch house that night the slow freight of Climax
whistled in the distance.
Etienne began it after supper. Miss Aclams had suddenly displayed a lively interest in
the kitchen layout and I could see her in there, chatting brightly at George&ndash;not with
him&ndash;the while he ducked his head and rattled his pans.
&ldquo;My fren&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Etienne, exhaling a large cloud from his cigarette and patting Ross
lightly on the shoulder with a bediamonded hand which, hung limp from a yard or more of
bony arm, &ldquo;I see I mus&rsquo; be frank with you. Firs&rsquo;, because we are rivals; second, because you
take these matters so serious. I&ndash;I am Frenchman. I love the women&rdquo; &ndash;he threw back his
curls, bared his yellow teeth, and blew an unsavory kiss toward the kitchen. &ldquo;It is, I suppose,
a trait of my nation. All Frenchmen love the women&ndash;pretty women. Now, look: Here I am!&rdquo;
He spread out his arms. &ldquo;Cold outside! I detes&rsquo; the col-l-l! Snow! I abominate the
mees-ser-rhable snow! Two men! This&ndash;&rdquo; pointing to me&ndash;&ldquo;an&rsquo; this!&rdquo; Pointing to&rsquo; Ross. &ldquo;I am
distracted! For two whole days I stan&rsquo; at the window an&rsquo; tear my &lsquo;air! I am nervous, upset,
pr-r-ro-foun&rsquo;ly distress inside my &lsquo;ead! An&rsquo; suddenly&ndash;be&rsquo;old! A woman, a nice, pretty,
charming, innocen&rsquo; young woman! I, naturally, rejoice. I become myself again&ndash;gay,
light-&lsquo;earted, &ldquo;appy. I address myself to mademoiselle; it passes the time. That, m&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;, is
wot the women are for&ndash;pass the time! Entertainment&ndash;like the music, like the wine!
&ldquo;They appeal to the mood, the caprice, the temperamen&rsquo;. To play with thees woman,
follow her through her humor, pursue her&ndash;ah! that is the mos&rsquo; delightful way to sen&rsquo; the
hours about their business.&rdquo;
Ross banged the table. &ldquo;Shut up, you miserable yeller pup!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;I object to your
pursuin&rsquo; anything or anybody in my house. Now, you listen to me, you&ndash;&rdquo; He picked up the
box of stogies and used it on the table as an emphasizer. The noise of it awoke the attention
of the girl in the kitchen. Unheeded, she crept into the room. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about
your French ways of lovemakin&rsquo; an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t care. In my section of the country, it&rsquo;s the best
man wins. And I&rsquo;m the best man here, and don&rsquo;t you forget it! This girl&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be mine.
There ain&rsquo;t g&rsquo;oing to be any playing, or philandering, or palm reading about it. I&rsquo;ve made up
my mind I&rsquo;ll have this girl, and that settles it. My word is the law in this neck o&rsquo; the woods.She&rsquo;s mine, and as soon as she says she&rsquo;s mine, you pull out.&rdquo; The box made one final,
tremendous punctuation point.
Etienne&rsquo;s bravado was unruffled. &ldquo;Ah! that is no way to win a woman,&rdquo; he smiled, easily.
&ldquo;I make prophecy you will never win &lsquo;er that way. No. Not thees woman. She mus&rsquo; be played
along an&rsquo; then keessed, this charming, delicious little creature. One kees! An&rsquo; then you &lsquo;ave
her.&rdquo; Again he displayed his unpleasant teeth. &ldquo;I make you a bet I will kees her&ndash;&rdquo;
As a cheerful chronicler of deeds done well, it joys me to relate that the hand which fell
upon Etienne&rsquo;s amorous lips was not his own. There was one sudden sound, as of a mule
kicking a lath fence, and then&ndash;through the swinging doors of oblivion for Etienne.
I had seen this blow delivered. It was an aloof, unstudied, almost absent-minded affair. I
had thought the cook was rehearsing the proper method of turning a flapjack.
Silently, lost in thought, he stood there scratching his head. Then he began rolling down
his sleeves.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get your things on, Miss, and we&rsquo;ll get out of here,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;Wrap up
warm.&rdquo;
I heard her heave a little sigh of relief as she went to get her cloak, sweater, and hat.
Ross jumped to his feet, and said: &ldquo;George, what are you goin&rsquo; to do?&rdquo;
George, who had been headed in my direction, slowly swivelled around and faced his
employer. &ldquo;Bein&rsquo; a camp cook, I ain&rsquo;t over-burdened with hosses,&rdquo; George enlightened us.
&ldquo;Therefore, I am going to try to borrow this feller&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;
For the first time in four days my soul gave a genuine cheer. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s for Lochinvar
purposes, go as far as you like,&rdquo; I said, grandly.
The cook studied me a moment, as if trying to find an insult in my words. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for mine and the young lady&rsquo;s purposes, and we&rsquo;ll go only three miles&ndash;to
Hicksville. Now let me tell you somethin&rsquo;, Ross.&rdquo; Suddenly I was confronted with the cook&rsquo;s
chunky back and I heard a low, curt, carrying voice shoot through the room at my host.
George had wheeled just as Ross started to speak. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re nutty. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter
with you. You can&rsquo;t stand the snow. You&rsquo;re getting nervouser, and nuttier every day. That and
this Dago&rdquo;&ndash;he jerked a thumb at the half-dead Frenchman in the corner&ndash;&ldquo;has got you to the
point where I thought I better horn in. I got to revolving it around in my mind and I seen if
somethin&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t done, and done soon, there&rsquo;d be murder around here and maybe&rdquo; &ndash;his
head gave an imperceptible list toward the girl&rsquo;s room&ndash;&ldquo;worse.&ldquo;He stopped, but he held up a stubby finger to keep any one else from speaking. Then
he plowed slowly through the drift of his ideas. &ldquo;About this here woman. I know you, Ross,
and I know what you reely think about women. If she hadn&rsquo;t happened in here durin&rsquo; this
here snow, you&rsquo;d never have given two thoughts to the whole woman question. Likewise,
when the storm clears, and you and the boys go hustlin&rsquo; out, this here whole business &rsquo;ll
clear out of your head and you won&rsquo;t think of a skirt again until Kingdom Come. Just because
o&rsquo; this snow here, don&rsquo;t forget you&rsquo;re living in the selfsame world you was in four days ago.
And you&rsquo;re the same man, too. Now, what&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; getting all snarled up over four days
of stickin&rsquo; in the house? That there&rsquo;s what I been revolvin&rsquo; in my mind and this here&rsquo;s the
decision I&rsquo;ve come to.&rdquo;
He plodded to the door and shouted to one of the ranch hands to saddle my horse.
Ross lit a stogy and stood thoughtful in the middle of the room. Then he began: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a
durn good notion, George, to knock your confounded head off and throw you into that
snowbank, if&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, mister. That ain&rsquo;t a durned good notion you&rsquo;ve got. It&rsquo;s durned bad. Look
here!&rdquo; He pointed steadily out of doors until we were both forced to follow his finger.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in here for more&rsquo;n a week yet.&rdquo; After allowing this fact to sink in, he barked out at
Ross: &ldquo;Can you cook?&rdquo; Then at me: &ldquo;Can you cook?&rdquo; Then he looked at the wreck of Etienne
and sniffed.
There was an embarrassing silence as Ross and I thought solemnly of a foodless week.
&ldquo;If you just use hoss sense,&rdquo; concluded George, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t go for to hurt my feelin&rsquo;s, all
I want to do is to take this young gal down to Hicksville; and then I&rsquo;ll head back here and
cook fer you.&rdquo;
The horse and Miss Adams arrived simultaneously, both of them very serious and quiet.
The horse because he knew what he had before him in that weather; the girl because of
what she had left behind.
Then all at once I awoke to a realization of what the cook was doing. &ldquo;My God, man!&rdquo; I
cried, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you afraid to go out in that snow?&rdquo;
Behind my back I heard Ross mutter, &ldquo;Not him.&rdquo;
George lifted the girl daintily up behind the saddle, drew on his gloves, put his foot in
the stirrup, and turned to inspect me leisurely.
As I passed slowly in his review, I saw in my mind&rsquo;s eye the algebraic equation of Snow,
the equals sign, and the answer in the man before me.&ldquo;Snow is my last name,&rdquo; said George. He swung into the saddle and they started
cautiously out into the darkening swirl of fresh new currency just issuing from the Snowdrop
Mint. The girl, to keep her place, clung happily to the sturdy figure of the camp cook.
I brought three things away from Ross Curtis&rsquo;s ranch house&ndash;yes, four. One was the
appreciation of snow, which I have so humbly tried here to render; (2) was a collarbone, of
which I am extra careful; (3) was a memory of what it is to eat very extremely bad food for a
week; and (4) was the cause of (3) a little note delivered at the end of the week and
hand-painted in blue pencil on a sheet of meat paper.
&ldquo;I cannot come back there to that there job. Mrs. Snow say no, George. I been revolvin&rsquo;
it in my mind; considerin&rsquo; circumstances she&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
Sociology in Serge and Straw （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The season of irresponsibility is at hand. Come, let us twine round our brows wreaths of
poison ivy (that is for idiocy), and wander hand in hand with sociology in the summer fields.
Likely as not the world is flat. The wise men have tried to prove that it is round, with
indifferent success. They pointed out to us a ship going to sea, and bade us observe that, at
length, the convexity of the earth hid from our view all but the vessel&rsquo;s topmast. But we
picked up a telescope and looked, and saw the decks and hull again. Then the wise men said:
&ldquo;Oh, pshaw! anyhow, the variation of the intersection of the equator and the ecliptic proves
it.&rdquo; We could not see this through our telescope, so we remained silent. But it stands to
reason that, if the world were round, the queues of China-Men would stand straight up from
their heads instead of hanging down their backs, as travellers assure us they do.
Another hot-weather corroboration of the flat theory is the fact that all of life, as we
know it, moves in little, unavailing circles. More justly than to anything else, it can be likened
to the game of baseball. Crack! we hit the ball, and away we go. If we earn a run (in life we
call it success) we get back to the home plate and sit upon a bench. If we are thrown out, we
walk back to the home plate &ndash; and sit upon a bench.
The circumnavigators of the alleged globe may have sailed the rim of a watery circle
back to the same port again. The truly great return at the high tide of their attainments to
the simplicity of a child. The billionaire sits down at his mahogany to his bowl of bread and
milk. When you reach the end of your career, just take down the sign &ldquo;Goal&rdquo; and look at the
other side of it. You will find &ldquo;Beginning Point&rdquo; there. It has been reversed while you were
going around the track.But this is humour, and must be stopped. Let us get back to the serious questions that
arise whenever Sociology turns summer boarder. You are invited to consider the scene of
the story-wild, Atlantic waves, thundering against a wooded and rock-bound shore &ndash; in the
Greater City of New York.
The town of Fishampton, on the south shore of Long Island, is noted for its clam fritters
and the summer residence of the Van Plushvelts.
The Van Plushvelts have a hundred million dollars, and their name is a household word
with tradesmen and photographers.
On the fifteenth of June the Van Plushvelts boarded up the front door of their city
house, carefully deposited their cat on the sidewalk, instructed the caretaker not to allow it
to eat any of the ivy on the walls, and whizzed away in a 40-horse-power to Fishampton to
stray alone the shade &ndash; Amaryllis not being in their class. If a subscriber to the Toadies&rsquo;
Magazine, you have often &ndash; You say you are not? Well, you buy it at a news-stand, thinking
that the newsdealer is not wise to you. But he knows about it all. HE knows &ndash; HE knows! I
say that you have often seen in the Toadies&rsquo; Magazine pictures of the Van Plushvelts&rsquo;
summer home; so it will not be described here. Our business is with young Haywood Van
Plushvelt, sixteen years old, heir to the century of millions, darling of the financial gods and
great grandson of Peter Van Plushvelt, former owner of a particularly fine cabbage patch
that has been ruined by an intrusive lot of downtown skyscrapers.
One afternoon young Haywood Van Plushvelt strolled out between the granite gate
posts of &ldquo;Dolce far Niente&rdquo; &ndash; that&rsquo;s what they called the place; and it was an improvement
on dolce Far Rockaway, I can tell you.
Haywood walked down into the village. He was human, after all, and his prospective
millions weighed upon him. Wealth had wreaked upon him its direfullest. He was the
product of private tutors. Even under his first hobby-horse had tan bark been strewn. He had
been born with a gold spoon, lobster fork and fish-set in his mouth. For which I hope, later,
to submit justification, I must ask your consideration of his haberdashery and tailoring.
Young Fortunatus was dressed in a neat suit of dark blue serge, a neat, white straw hat,
neat low-cut tan shoes, of the well-known &ldquo;immaculate&rdquo; trade mark, a neat, narrow
four-in-hand tie, and carried a slender, neat, bamboo cane.
Down Persimmon Street (there&rsquo;s never tree north of Hagerstown, Md.) came from the
village &ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; Dodson, fifteen and a half, worst boy in Fishampton. &ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; was dressed
in a ragged red sweater, wrecked and weather-worn golf cap, run-over shoes, and trousers of
the &ldquo;serviceable&rdquo; brand. Dust, clinging to the moisture induced by free exercise, darkened
wide areas of his face. &ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; carried a baseball bat, and a league ball that advertised itself
in the rotundity of his trousers pocket. Haywood stopped and passed the time of day.&ldquo;Going to play ball?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Smoky&rsquo;s&rdquo; eyes and countenance confronted him with a frank blue-and-freckled
scrutiny.
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; he said, with deadly mildness; &ldquo;sure not. Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;ve got a divin&rsquo; suit on?
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; up in a submarine balloon to catch butterflies with a two-inch auger.
&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Haywood, with the insulting politeness of his caste, &ldquo;for mistaking
you for a gentleman. I might have known better.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How might you have known better if you thought I was one?&rdquo; said &ldquo;Smoky,&rdquo;
unconsciously a logician.
&ldquo;By your appearances,&rdquo; said Haywood. &ldquo;No gentleman is dirty, ragged and a liar.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; hooted once like a ferry-boat, spat on his hand, got a firm grip on his baseball
bat and then dropped it against the fence.
&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I knows you. You&rsquo;re the pup that belongs in that swell private summer
sanitarium for city-guys over there. I seen you come out of the gate. You can&rsquo;t bluff nobody
because you&rsquo;re rich. And because you got on swell clothes. Arabella! Yah!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ragamuffin!&rdquo; said Hay-wood.
&ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; picked up a fence-rail splinter and laid it on his shoulder.
&ldquo;Dare you to knock it off,&rdquo; he challenged.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t soil my hands with you,&rdquo; said the aristocrat.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Fraid,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; concisely. &ldquo;Youse city-ducks ain&rsquo;t got the I sand. I kin lick you with
one hand.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to have any trouble with you,&rdquo; said Haywood. &ldquo;I asked you a civil question;
and you replied, like a &ndash; like a &ndash; a cad.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s a cad?&rdquo; asked &ldquo;Smoky.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A cad is a disagreeable person,&rdquo; answered Haywood, &ldquo;who lacks manners and doesn&rsquo;t
know his place. They, sometimes play baseball.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I can tell you what a mollycoddle is,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Smoky.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a monkey dressed up by its
mother and sent out too pick daisies on the lawn.&ldquo;&ldquo;When you have the honour to refer to the members of my family,&rdquo; said Haywood, with
some dim ideas of a code in his mind, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better leave the ladies out of your remarks.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ho! ladies!&rdquo; mocked the rude one. &ldquo;I say ladies! I know what them rich women in the
city does. They, drink cocktails and swear and give parties to gorillas. The papers says so.&rdquo;
Then Haywood knew that it must be. He took off his coat, folded it neatly and laid it on
the roadside grass, placed his hat upon it and began to unknot his blue silk tie.
&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t yer better ring fer yer maid, Arabella?&rdquo; taunted &ldquo;Smoky.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wot yer going to do
&ndash; go to bed?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give you a good trouncing,&rdquo; said the hero. He did not hesitate, although
the enemy was far beneath him socially. He remembered that his father once thrashed a
cabman, and the papers gave it two columns, first page. And the Toadies&rsquo; Magazine had a
special article on Upper Cuts by the Upper Classes, and ran new pictures of the Van Plushvelt
country seat, at Fishampton.
&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s trouncing?&rdquo; asked &ldquo;Smoky,&rdquo; suspiciously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your old clothes. I&rsquo;m no &ndash;
oh, you mean to scrap! My, my! I won&rsquo;t do a thing to mamma&rsquo;s pet. Criminy! I&rsquo;d hate to be a
hand-laundered thing like you.
&ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; waited with some awkwardness for his adversary to prepare for battle. His
own decks were always clear for action. When he should spit upon the palm of his terrible
right it was equivalent to &ldquo;You may fire now, Gridley.&rdquo;
The hated patrician advanced, with his shirt sleeves neatly rolled up. &ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; waited, in
an attitude of ease, expecting the affair to be conducted according to Fishampton&rsquo;s rules of
war. These allowed combat to be prefaced by stigma, recrimination, epithet, abuse and
insult gradually increasing in emphasis and degree. After a round of these &ldquo;you&rsquo;re anothers&rdquo;
would come the chip knocked from the shoulder, or the advance across the &ldquo;dare&rdquo; line
drawn with a toe on the ground. Next light taps given and taken, these also increasing in
force until finally the blood was up and fists going at their best.
But Haywood did not know Fishampton&rsquo;s rules. Noblesse oblige kept a faint smile on
his face as he walked slowly up to &ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; and said:
&ldquo;Going to play ball?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; quickly understood this to be a putting of the previous question, giving him
the chance to make practical apology by answering it with civility and relevance.&ldquo;Listen this time,&rsquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; skatin&rsquo; on the river. Don&rsquo;t you see me automobile
with Chinese lanterns on it standin&rsquo; and waitin&rsquo; for me?&rdquo;
Haywood knocked him down.
&ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; felt wronged. To thus deprive him of preliminary wrangle and objurgation was
to send an armoured knight full tilt against a crashing lance without permitting him first to
caracole around the list to the flourish of trumpets. But he scrambled up and fell upon his
foe, head, feet and fists.
The fight lasted one round of an hour and ten minutes. It was lengthened until it was
more like a war or a family feud than a fight. Haywood had learned some of the science of
boxing and wrestling from his tutors, but these he discarded for the more instinctive
methods of battle handed down by the cave-dwelling Van Plushvelts.
So, when he found himself, during the mêlée, seated upon the kicking and roaring
&ldquo;Smoky&rsquo;s&rdquo; chest, he improved the opportunity by vigorously kneading handfuls of sand and
soil into his adversary&rsquo;s ears, eyes and mouth, and when &ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; got the proper leg hold
and &ldquo;turned&rdquo; him, he fastened both hands in the Plushvelt hair and pounded the Plushvelt
head against the lap of mother earth. Of course, the strife was not incessantly active. There
were seasons when one sat upon the other, holding him down, while each blew like a
grampus, spat out the more inconveniently large sections of gravel and and strove to subdue
the spirit of his opponent with a frightful and soul-paralyzing glare.
At last, it seemed that in the language of the ring, their efforts lacked steam. They broke
away, and each disappeared in a cloud as he brushed away the dust of the conflict. As soon
as his breath permitted, Haywood walked close to &ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; and said:
&ldquo;Going to play ball?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; looked pensively at the sky, at his bat lying on the ground, and at the &ldquo;leaguer&rdquo;
rounding his pocket.
&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he said, offhandedly. &ldquo;The &lsquo;Yellowjackets&rsquo;&rdquo; plays the &lsquo;Long Islands.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m cap&rsquo;n of
the &lsquo;Long Islands.&rsquo;
&ldquo;I guess I didn&rsquo;t mean to say you were ragged,&rdquo; said Haywood. &ldquo;But you are dirty, you
know.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Smoky.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yer get that way knockin&rsquo; around. Say, I don&rsquo;t believe them New
York papers about ladies drinkin&rsquo; and havin&rsquo; monkeys dinin&rsquo; at the table with &lsquo;em. I guess
they&rsquo;re lies, like they print about people eatin&rsquo; out of silver plates, and ownin&rsquo; dogs that cost
$100.&ldquo;&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Haywood. &ldquo;What do you play on your team?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ketcher. Ever play any?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Never in my life,&rdquo; said Haywood. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never known any fellows except one or two of
my cousins.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Jer like to learn? We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to have a practice- game before the match. Wanter come
along? I&rsquo;ll put yer in left-field, and yer won&rsquo;t be long ketchin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like it bully,&rdquo; said Haywood. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve alway wanted to play baseball.&rdquo;
The ladies&rsquo; maids of New York and the families of Western mine owners with social
ambitions will remember well the sensation that was created by the report that the young
multi-millionaire, Haywood Van Plushvelt, was playing ball with the village youths of
Fishampton. It was conceded that the millennium of democracy had come. Reporters and
photographers swarmed to the island. The papers printed half-page pictures of him as
short-stop stopping a hot grounder. The Toadies&rsquo; Magazine got out a Bat and Ball number
that covered the subject historically, beginning with the vampire bat and ending with the
Patriarchs&rsquo; ball &ndash; illustrated with interior views of the Van Plushvelt country seat. Ministers,
educators and sociologists everywhere hailed the event as the tocsin call that proclaimed
the universal brotherhood of man.
One afternoon I was reclining under the trees near the shore at Fishampton in the
esteemed company of an eminent, bald-headed young sociologist. By way of note it may be
inserted that all sociologists are more or less bald, and exactly thirty-two. Look &lsquo;em over.
The sociologist was citing the Van Plushvelt case as the most important &ldquo;uplift&rdquo;
symptom of a generation, and as an excuse for his own existence.
Immediately before us were the village baseball grounds. And now came the sportive
youth of Fishampton and distributed themselves, shouting, about the diamond. &ldquo;There,&rdquo;
said the sociologist, pointing, &ldquo;there is young Van Plushvelt.&rdquo;
I raised myself (so far a cosycophant with Mary Ann) and gazed.
Young Van Plushvelt sat upon the ground. He was dressed in a ragged red sweater,
wrecked and weather- worn golf cap, run-over shoes, and trousers of the &ldquo;serviceable&rdquo;
brand. Dust clinging to the moisture induced by free exercise, darkened wide areas of his
face.
&ldquo;That is he,&rdquo; repeated the sociologist. If he had said &ldquo;him&rdquo; I could have been less
vindictive.On a bench, with an air, sat the young millionaire&rsquo;s chum.
He was dressed in a neat suit of dark blue serge, a neat white straw hat, neat low-cut
tan shoes, linen of the well-known &ldquo;immaculate&rdquo; trade mark, a neat, narrow four-in-hand tie,
and carried a- slender, neat bamboo cane.
I laughed loudly and vulgarly.
&ldquo;What you want to do,&rdquo; said I to the sociologist, &ldquo;is to establish a reformatory for the
Logical Vicious Circle. Or else I&rsquo;ve got wheels. It looks to me as if things are running round
and round in circles instead of getting anywhere.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the man of progress.
&ldquo;Why, look what he has done to &ldquo;Smoky,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;You will always be a fool,&rdquo; said my friend, the sociologist, getting up and walking away.
The Song and the Sergeant （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Half a dozen people supping at a table in one of the upper-Broadway all-night
restaurants were making too much noise. Three times the manager walked past them with a
politely warning glance; but their argument had waxed too warm to be quelled by a
manager&rsquo;s gaze. It was midnight, and the restaurant was filled with patrons from the
theatres of that district. Some among the dispersed audiences must have recognized among
the quarrelsome sextet the faces of the players belonging to the Carroll Comedy Company.
Four of the six made up the company. Another was the author of the comedietta, &ldquo;A
Gay Coquette,&rdquo; which the quartette of layers had been presenting with fair success at
several vaudeville houses in the city. The sixth at the table was a person inconsequent in the
realm of art, but one at whose bidding many lobsters had perished.
Loudly the six maintained their clamorous debate. No one of the Party was silent
except when answers were stormed from him by the excited ones. That was the comedian of
&ldquo;A Gay Coquette.&rdquo; He was a young man with a face even too melancholy for his profession.
The oral warfare of four immoderate tongues was directed at Miss Clarice Carroll, the
twinkling star of the small aggregation. Excepting the downcast comedian, all members of
the party united in casting upon her with vehemence the blame of some momentous
misfortune. Fifty times they told her: &ldquo;It is your fault, Clarice- it is you alone who spoilt thescene. It is only of late that you have acted this way. At this rate the sketch will have to be
taken off.&rdquo;
Miss Carroll was a match for any four. Gallic ancestry gave her a vivacity that could
easily mount to fury. Her large eyes flashed a scorching denial at her accusers. Her slender,
eloquent arms constantly menaced the tableware. Her high, clear soprano voice rose to
what would have been a scream had it not possessed so pure a musical quality. She hurled
back at the attacking four their denunciations in tones sweet, but of too great carrying
power for a Broadway restaurant.
Finally they exhausted her patience both as a woman and an artist. She sprang up like a
panther, managed to smash half a dozen plates and glasses with one royal sweep of her arm,
and defied her critics. They rose and wrangled more loudly. The comedian sighed and looked
a trifle sadder and disinterested. The manager came tripping and suggested peace. He was
told to go to the popular synonym for war so promptly that the affair might have happened
at The Hague.
Thus was the manager angered. He made a sign with his hand and a waiter slipped out
of the door. In twenty minutes the party of six was in a police station facing a grizzled and
philosophical desk sergeant.
&ldquo;Disorderly conduct in a restaurant,&rdquo; said the police- man who had brought the party
in.
The author of &ldquo;A Gay Coquette&rdquo; stepped to the front. He wore nose-glasses and
evening clothes, even if his shoes had been tans before they met the patent-leather-polish
bottle.
&ldquo;Mr. Sergeant,&rdquo; said he, out of his throat, like Actor Irving, &ldquo;I would like to protest
against this arrest. The company of actors who are performing in a little play that I have
written, in company with a friend and myself were having a little supper. We became deeply
interested in the discussion as to which one of the cast is responsible for a scene in the
sketch that lately has fallen so flat that the piece is about to become a failure. We may have
been rather noisy and intolerant of interruption by the restaurant people; but the matter
was of considerable importance to all of us. You see that we are sober and are not the kind
of people who desire to raise disturbances. I hope that the case will not be pressed and that
we may be allowed to go.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Who makes the charge?&rdquo; asked the sergeant.
&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; said a white-aproned voice in the rear. &ldquo;De restaurant sent me to. De gang was
raisin&rsquo; a rough- house and breakin&rsquo; dishes.&ldquo;&ldquo;The dishes were paid for,&rdquo; said the playwright. &ldquo;They were not broken purposely. In
her anger, because we remonstrated with her for spoiling the scene, Miss &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true, sergeant,&rdquo; cried the clear voice of Miss. Clarice Carroll. In a long coat of
tan silk and a red- plumed hat, she bounded before the desk.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault,&rdquo; she cried indignantly. &ldquo;How- dare they say such a thing! I&rsquo;ve played
the title r?le ever since it was staged, and if you want to know who made it a success, ask
the public &ndash; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What Miss Carroll says is true in part,&rdquo; said the author. &ldquo;For five months the
comedietta was a drawing- card in the best houses. But during the last two weeks it has lost
favour. There is one scene in it in which Miss Carroll made a big hit. Now she hardly gets a
hand out of it. She spoils it by acting it entirely different from her old way.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is not my fault,&rdquo; reiterated the actress.
&ldquo;There are only two of you on in the scene,&rdquo; argued the playwright hotly, &ldquo;you and
Delmars, here &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s his fault,&rdquo; declared Miss Carroll, with a lightning glance of scorn from her
dark eyes. The comedian caught it, and gazed with increased melancholy at the panels of the
sergeant&rsquo;s desk.
The night was a dull one in that particular police station.
The sergeant&rsquo;s long-blunted curiosity awoke a little.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard you,&rdquo; he said to the author. And then he addressed the thin-faced and
ascetic-looking lady of the company who played &ldquo;Aunt Turnip-top&rdquo; in the little comedy.
&ldquo;Who do you think spoils the scene you are fussing about?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no knocker,&rdquo; said that lady, &ldquo;and everybody knows it. So, when I say that Clarice
falls down every time in that scene I&rsquo;m judging her art and not herself. She was great in it
once. She does it something fierce now. It&rsquo;ll dope the show if she keeps it up.&rdquo;
The sergeant looked at the comedian.
&ldquo;You and the lady have this scene together, I under- stand. I suppose there&rsquo;s no use
asking you which one of you queers it?&rdquo;
The comedian avoided the direct rays from the two fixed stars of Miss Carroll&rsquo;s eyes.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, looking down at his patent- leather toes.
&ldquo;Are you one of the actors?&rdquo; asked the sergeant of a dwarfish youth with a middle-aged
face.
&ldquo;Why, say!&rdquo; replied the last Thespian witness, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t notice any tin spear in my
hands, do you? You haven&rsquo;t heard me shout: &lsquo;See, the Emperor comes!&rsquo; since I&rsquo;ve been in
here, have you? I guess I&rsquo;m on the stage long enough for &lsquo;em not to start a panic by
mistaking me for a thin curl of smoke rising above the footlights.&rdquo;
&ldquo;In your opinion, if you&rsquo;ve got one,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;is the frost that gathers on the
scene in question the work of the lady or the gentleman who takes part in it?&rdquo;
The middle-aged youth looked pained.
&ldquo;I regret to say,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that Miss Carroll seems to have lost her grip on that
scene. She&rsquo;s all right in the rest of the play, but &ndash; but I tell you, sergeant, she can do it &ndash; she
has done it equal to any of &lsquo;em &ndash; and she can do it again.&rdquo;
Miss Carroll ran forward, glowing and palpitating.
&ldquo;Thank you, Jimmy, for the first good word I&rsquo;ve had in many a day,&rdquo; she cried. And then
she turned her eager face toward the desk.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you, sergeant, whether I am to blame. I&rsquo;ll show them whether I can do that
same. Come, Mr. Delmars; let us begin. You will let us, won&rsquo;t you, sergeant?&rdquo;
&ldquo;How long will it take?&rdquo; asked the sergeant, dubiously.
&ldquo;Eight minutes,&rdquo; said the playwright. &ldquo;The entire play consumes but thirty.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You may go ahead,&rdquo; said the sergeant. &ldquo;Most of you seem to side against the little lady.
Maybe she had a right to crack up a saucer or two in that restaurant. We&rsquo;ll see how she does
the turn before we take that up.&rdquo;
The matron of the police station had been standing near, listening to the singular
argument. She came nigher and stood near the sergeant&rsquo;s chair. Two or three of the reserves
strolled in, big and yawning.
&ldquo;Before beginning the scene,&rdquo; said the playwright, &ldquo;and assuming that you have not
seen a production of &lsquo;A Gay Coquette,&rsquo; I will make a brief but necessary explanation. It is a
musical-farce-comedy &ndash; burlesque-comedietta. As the title implies, Miss Carroll&rsquo;s r?le is that
of a gay, rollicking, mischievous, heartless coquette. She sustains that character throughoutthe entire comedy part of the production. And I have designed the extravaganza features so
that she may preserve and present the same coquettish idea.
&ldquo;Now, the scene in which we take exception to Miss Carroll&rsquo;s acting is called the &lsquo;gorilla
dance.&rsquo; She is costumed to represent a wood nymph, and there is a great song-and-dance
scene with a gorilla &ndash; played by Mr. Delmars, the comedian. A tropical-forest stage is set.
&ldquo;That used to get four and five recalls. The main thing was the acting and the dance &ndash; it
was the funniest thing in New York for five months. Delmars&rsquo;s song, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll Woo Thee to My
Sylvan Home,&rsquo; while he and Miss Carroll were cutting hide-and-seek capers among the
tropical plants, was a winner.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble with the scene now?&rdquo; asked the sergeant.
&ldquo;Miss Carroll spoils it right in the middle of it,&rdquo; said the playwright wrathfully.
With a wide gesture of her ever-moving arms the actress waved back the little group of
spectators, leaving a space in front of the desk for the scene of her vindication or fall. Then
she whipped off her long tan cloak and tossed it across the arm of the policeman who still
stood officially among them.
Miss Carroll had gone to supper well cloaked, but in the costume of the tropic wood
nymph. A skirt of fern leaves touched her knee; she was like a humming- bird &ndash; green and
golden and purple.
And then she danced a fluttering, fantastic dance, so agile and light and mazy in her
steps that the other three members of the Carroll Comedy Company broke into applause at
the art of it.
And at the proper time Delmars leaped out at her side, mimicking the uncouth, hideous
bounds of the gorilla so funnily that the grizzled sergeant himself gave a short laugh like the
closing of a padlock. They danced together the gorilla dance, and won a hand from all.
Then began the most fantastic part of the scene &ndash; the wooing of the nymph by the
gorilla. It was a kind of dance itself &ndash; eccentric and prankish, with the nymph coquettish and
seductive retreat, followed by the gorilla as he sang &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Woo Thee to My Sylvan Home.&rdquo;
The song was a lyric of merit. The words were non- sense, as befitted the play, but the
music was worthy of something better. Delmars struck into it in a rich tenor that owned a
quality that shamed the flippant words.
During one verse of the song the wood nymph per- formed the grotesque evolutions
designed for the scene. At the middle of the second verse she stood still, with a strange look
on her face, seeming to gaze dreamily into the depths of the scenic forest. The gorilla&rsquo;s lastleap had brought him to her feet, and there he knelt, holding her hand, until he had finished
the haunting-lyric that was set in the absurd comedy like a diamond in a piece of putty.
When Delmars ceased Miss Carroll started, and covered a sudden flow of tears with
both hands.
&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried the playwright, gesticulating with violence; &ldquo;there you have it, sergeant.
For two weeks she has spoiled that scene in just that manner at every performance. I have
begged her to consider that it is not Ophelia or Juliet that she is playing. Do you wonder now
at our impatience? Tears for the gorilla song! The play is lost!&rdquo;
Out of her bewitchment, whatever it was, the wood nymph flared suddenly, and
pointed a desperate finger at Delmars.
&ldquo;It is you &ndash; you who have done this,&rdquo; she cried wildly. &ldquo;You never sang that song that
way until lately. It is your doing.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I give it up,&rdquo; said the sergeant.
And then the gray-haired matron of the police station came forward from behind the
sergeant&rsquo;s chair.
&ldquo;Must an old woman teach you all?&rdquo; she said. She went up to Miss Carroll and took her
hand.
&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s wearing his heart out for you, my dear. Couldn&rsquo;t you tell it the first note you
heard him sing? All of his monkey flip-flops wouldn&rsquo;t have kept it from me. Must you be deaf
as well as blind? That&rsquo;s why you couldn&rsquo;t act your part, child. Do you love him or must he be
a gorilla for the rest of his days?&rdquo;
Miss Carroll whirled around and caught Delmars with a lightning glance of her eye. He
came toward her, melancholy.
&ldquo;Did you hear, Mr. Delmars?&rdquo; she asked, with a catching breath.
&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said the comedian. &ldquo;It is true. I didn&rsquo;t think there was any use. I tried to let you
know with the song.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Silly!&rdquo; said the matron; &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried the wood nymph, &ldquo;his way was the best. I didn&rsquo;t know, but &ndash; it was just
what I wanted, Bobby.&rdquo;
She sprang like a green grasshopper; and the comedian opened his arms, and &ndash; smiled.&ldquo;Get out of this,&rdquo; roared the desk sergeant to the waiting waiter from the restaurant.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing doing here for you.&rdquo;
The Sparrows in Madison Square （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The young man in straitened circumstances who comes to New York City to enter
literature has but one thing to do, provided he has studied carefully his field in advance. He
must go straight to Madison Square, write an article about the sparrows there, and sell it to
the Sun for $15.
I cannot recall either a novel or a story dealing with the popular theme of the young
writer from the provinces who comes to the metropolis to win fame and fortune with his
pen in which the hero does not get his start that way. It does seem strange that some author,
in casting about for startlingly original plots, has not hit upon the idea of having his hero
write about the bluebirds in Union Square and sell it to the Herald. But a search through the
files of metropolitan fiction counts up overwhelmingly for the sparrows and the old Garden
Square, and the Sun always writes the check.
Of course it is easy to understand why this first city venture of the budding author is
always successful. He is primed by necessity to a superlative effort; mid the iron and stone
and marble of the roaring city he has found this spot of singing birds and green grass and
trees; every tender sentiment in his nature is baffling with the sweet pain of homesickness;
his genius is aroused as it never may be again; the birds chirp, the tree branches sway, the
noise of wheels is forgotten; he writes with his soul in his pen&ndash;and he sells it to the Sun for
$15.
I had read of this custom during many years before I came to New York. When my
friends were using their strongest arguments to dissuade me from coming, I only smiled
serenely. They did not know of that sparrow graft I had up my sleeve.
When I arrived in New York, and the car took me straight from the ferry up
Twenty-third Street to Madison Square, I could hear that $15 check rustling in my inside
pocket.
I obtained lodging at an unhyphenated hostelry, and the next morning I was on a bench
in Madison Square almost by the time the sparrows were awake. Their melodious chirping,
the benignant spring foliage of the noble trees and the clean, fragrant grass reminded me so
potently of the old farm I had left that tears almost came into my eyes.Then, all in a moment, I felt my inspiration. The brave, piercing notes of those cheerful
small birds formed a keynote to a wonderful, light, fanciful song of hope and joy and
altruism. Like myself, they were creatures with hearts pitched to the tune of woods and
fields; as I was, so were they captives by circumstance in the discordant, dull city&ndash;yet with
how much grace and glee they bore the restraint!
And then the early morning people began to pass through the square to their
work&ndash;sullen people, with sidelong glances and glum faces, hurrying, hurrying, hurrying. And
I got my theme cut out clear from the bird notes, and wrought it into a lesson, and a poem,
and a carnival dance, and a lullaby; and then translated it all into prose and began to write.
For two hours my pencil traveled over my pad with scarcely a rest. Then I went to the
little room I had rented for two days, and there I cut it to half, and then mailed it, white-hot,
to the Sun.
The next morning I was up by daylight and spent two cents of my capital for a paper. If
the word &ldquo;sparrow&rdquo; was in it I was unable to find it. I took it up to my room and spread it out
on the bed and went over it, column by column. Something was wrong.
Three hours afterward the postman brought me a large envelope containing my MS.
and a piece of inexpensive paper, about 3 inches by 4&ndash;I suppose some of you have seen
them&ndash;upon which was written in violet ink, &ldquo;With the Sun&rsquo;s thanks.&rdquo;
I went over to the square and sat upon a bench. No; I did not think it necessary to eat
any breakfast that morning. The confounded pests of sparrows were making the square
hideous with their idiotic &ldquo;cheep, cheep.&rdquo; I never saw birds so persistently noisy, impudent,
and disagreeable in all my life.
By this time, according to all traditions, I should have been standing in the office of the
editor of the Sun. That personage&ndash;a tall, grave, white-haired man&ndash;would strike a silver bell
as he grasped my hand and wiped a suspicious moisture from his glasses.
&ldquo;Mr. McChesney,&rdquo; he would be saying when a subordinate appeared, &ldquo;this is Mr. Henry,
the young man who sent in that exquisite gem about the sparrows in Madison Square. You
may give him a desk at once. Your salary, sir, will be $80 a week, to begin with.&rdquo;
This was what I had been led to expect by all writers who have evolved romances of
literary New York.
Something was decidedly wrong with tradition. I could not assume the blame, so I fixed
it upon the sparrows. I began to hate them with intensity and heat.
At that moment an individual wearing an excess of whiskers, two hats, and a
pestilential air slid into the seat beside me.&ldquo;Say, Willie,&rdquo; he muttered cajolingly, &ldquo;could you cough up a dime out of your coffers for
a cup of coffee this morning?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m lung-weary, my friend,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The best I can do is three cents.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And you look like a gentleman, too,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What brung you down?&ndash;boozer?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Birds,&rdquo; I said fiercely. &ldquo;The brown-throated songsters carolling songs of hope and cheer
to weary man toiling amid the city&rsquo;s dust and din. The little feathered couriers from the
meadows and woods chirping sweetly to us of blue skies and flowering fields. The
confounded little squint-eyed nuisances yawping like a flock of steam pianos, and stuffing
themselves like aldermen with grass seeds and bugs, while a man sits on a bench and goes
without his breakfast. Yes, sir, birds! look at them!&rdquo;
As I spoke I picked up a dead tree branch that lay by the bench, and hurled it with all
my force into a close congregation of the sparrows on the grass. The flock flew to the trees
with a babel of shrill cries; but two of them remained prostrate upon the turf.
In a moment my unsavory friend had leaped over the row of benches and secured the
fluttering victims, which he thrust hurriedly into his pockets. Then he beckoned me with a
dirty forefinger.
&ldquo;Come on, cully,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in on the feed.&rdquo;
Thank you very much!
Weakly I followed my dingy acquaintance. He led me away from the park down a side
street and through a crack in a fence into a vacant lot where some excavating had been
going on. Behind a pile of old stones and lumber he paused, and took out his birds.
&ldquo;I got matches,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You got any paper to start a fire with?&rdquo;
I drew forth my manuscript story of the sparrows, and offered it for burnt sacrifice.
There were old planks, splinters, and chips for our fire. My frowsy friend produced from
some interior of his frayed clothing half a loaf of bread, pepper, and salt.
In ten minutes each of us was holding a sparrow spitted upon a stick over the leaping
flames.
&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said my fellow bivouacker, &ldquo;this ain&rsquo;t so bad when a fellow&rsquo;s hungry. It reminds
me of when I struck New York first&ndash;about fifteen years ago. I come in from the West to see if
I could get a job on a newspaper. I hit the Madison Square Park the first mornin&rsquo; after, and
was sitting around on the benches. I noticed the sparrows chirpin&rsquo;, and the grass and treesso nice and green that I thought I was back in the country again. Then I got some papers out
of my pocket, and&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;You sent it to the Sun and got $15.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said my friend, suspiciously, &ldquo;you seem to know a good deal. Where was you? I
went to sleep on the bench there, in the sun, and somebody touched me for every cent I
had&ndash;$15.&rdquo;
The Sphinx Apple （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Twenty miles out from Paradise, and fifteen miles short of Sunrise City, Bildad Rose, the
stage-driver, stopped his team. A furious snow had been falling all day. Eight inches it
measured now, on a level. The remainder of the road was not without peril in daylight,
creeping along the ribs of a bijou range of ragged mountains. Now, when both snow and
night masked its dangers, further travel was not to be thought of, said Bildad Rose. So he
pulled up his four stout horses, and delivered to his five passengers oral deductions of his
wisdom.
Judge Menefee, to whom men granted leadership and the initiatory as upon a silver
salver, sprang from the coach at once. Four of his fellow-passengers followed, inspired by his
example, ready to explore, to objurgate, to resist, to submit, to proceed, according as their
prime factor might be inclined to sway them. The fifth passenger, a young woman, remained
in the coach.
Bildad had halted upon the shoulder of the first mountain spur. Two rail-fences,
ragged-black, hemmed the road. Fifty yards above the upper fence, showing a dark blot in
the white drifts, stood a small house. Upon this house descended&ndash;or rather
ascended&ndash;Judge Menefee and his cohorts with boyish whoops born of the snow and stress.
They called; they pounded at window and door. At the inhospitable silence they waxed
restive; they assaulted and forced the pregnable barriers, and invaded the premises.
The watchers from the coach heard stumblings and shoutings from the interior of the
ravaged house. Before long a light within flickered, glowed, flamed high and bright and
cheerful. Then came running back through the driving flakes the exuberant explorers. More
deeply pitched than the clarion&ndash;even orchestral in volume&ndash;the voice of Judge Menefee
proclaimed the succour that lay in apposition with their state of travail. The one room of the
house was uninhabited, he said, and bare of furniture; but it contained a great fireplace, and
they had discovered an ample store of chopped wood in a lean-to at the rear. Housing andwarmth against the shivering night were thus assured. For the placation of Bildad Rose there
was news of a stable, not ruined beyond service, with hay in a loft, near the house.
&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; cried Bildad Rose from his seat, swathed in coats and robes, &ldquo;tear me
down two panels of that fence, so I can drive in. That is old man Redruth&rsquo;s shanty. I thought
we must be nigh it. They took him to the foolish house in August.&rdquo;
Cheerfully the four passengers sprang at the snow-capped rails. The exhorted team
tugged the coach up the slant to the door of the edifice from which a mid-summer madness
had ravished its proprietor. The driver and two of the passengers began to unhitch. Judge
Menefee opened the door of the coach, and removed his hat.
&ldquo;I have to announce, Miss Garland,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the enforced suspension of our journey.
The driver asserts that the risk in travelling the mountain road by night is too great even to
consider. It will be necessary to remain in the shelter of this house until morning. I beg that
you will feel that there is nothing to fear beyond a temporary inconvenience. I have
personally inspected the house, and find that there are means to provide against the rigour
of the weather, at least. You shall be made as comfortable as possible. Permit me to assist
you to alight.&rdquo;
To the Judge&rsquo;s side came the passenger whose pursuit in life was the placing of the
Little Goliath windmill. His name was Dunwoody; but that matters not much. In travelling
merely from Paradise to Sunrise City one needs little or no name. Still, one who would seek
to divide honours with Judge Madison L. Menefee deserves a cognomenal peg upon which
Fame may hang a wreath. Thus spake, loudly and buoyantly, the aerial miller:
&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll have to climb out of the ark, Mrs. McFarland. This wigwam isn&rsquo;t exactly
the Palmer House, but it turns snow, and they won&rsquo;t search your grip for souvenir spoons
when you leave. We&rsquo;ve got a fire going; and we&rsquo;ll fix you up with dry Tilbys and keep the
mice away, anyhow, all right, all right.&rdquo;
One of the two passengers who were struggling in a melee of horses, harness, snow,
and the sarcastic injunctions of Bildad Rose, called loudly from the whirl of his volunteer
duties: &ldquo;Say! some of you fellows get Miss Solomon into the house, will you? Whoa, there!
you confounded brute!&rdquo;
Again must it be gently urged that in travelling from Paradise to Sunrise City an accurate
name is prodigality. When Judge Menefee&ndash; sanctioned to the act by his grey hair and
widespread repute&ndash;had introduced himself to the lady passenger, she had, herself, sweetly
breathed a name, in response, that the hearing of the male passengers had variously
interpreted. In the not unjealous spirit of rivalry that eventuated, each clung stubbornly to
his own theory. For the lady passenger to have reasseverated or corrected would have
seemed didactic if not unduly solicitous of a specific acquaintance. Therefore the lady
passenger permitted herself to be Garlanded and McFarlanded and Solomoned with equaland discreet complacency. It is thirty-five miles from Paradise to Sunrise City. Compagnon de
voyage is name enough, by the gripsack of the Wandering Jew! for so brief a journey.
Soon the little party of wayfarers were happily seated in a cheerful arc before the
roaring fire. The robes, cushions, and removable portions of the coach had been brought in
and put to service. The lady passenger chose a place near the hearth at one end of the arc.
There she graced almost a throne that her subjects had prepared. She sat upon cushions and
leaned against an empty box and barrel, robe bespread, which formed a defence from the
invading draughts. She extended her feet, delectably shod, to the cordial heat. She ungloved
her hands, but retained about her neck her long fur boa. The unstable flames half revealed,
while the warding boa half submerged, her face&ndash; a youthful face, altogether feminine,
clearly moulded and calm with beauty&rsquo;s unchallenged confidence. Chivalry and manhood
were here vying to please and comfort her. She seemed to accept their devoirs&ndash;not
piquantly, as one courted and attended; nor preeningly, as many of her sex unworthily reap
their honours; not yet stolidly, as the ox receives his hay; but concordantly with nature&rsquo;s own
plan&ndash;as the lily ingests the drop of dew foreordained to its refreshment.
Outside the wind roared mightily, the fine snow whizzed through the cracks, the cold
besieged the backs of the immolated six; but the elements did not lack a champion that
night. Judge Menefee was attorney for the storm. The weather was his client, and he strove
by special pleading to convince his companions in that frigid jury-box that they sojourned in
a bower of roses, beset only by benignant zephyrs. He drew upon a fund of gaiety, wit, and
anecdote, sophistical, but crowned with success. His cheerfulness communicated itself
irresistibly. Each one hastened to contribute his own quota toward the general optimism.
Even the lady passenger was moved to expression.
&ldquo;I think it is quite charming,&rdquo; she said, in her slow, crystal tones.
At intervals some one of the passengers would rise and humorously explore the room.
There was little evidence to be collected of its habitation by old man Redruth.
Bildad Rose was called upon vivaciously for the ex-hermit&rsquo;s history. Now, since the
stage-driver&rsquo;s horses were fairly comfortable and his passengers appeared to be so, peace
and comity returned to him.
&ldquo;The old didapper,&rdquo; began Bildad, somewhat irreverently, &ldquo;infested this here house
about twenty year. He never allowed nobody to come nigh him. He&rsquo;d duck his head inside
and slam the door whenever a team drove along. There was spinning-wheels up in his loft,
all right. He used to buy his groceries and tobacco at Sam Tilly&rsquo;s store, on the Little Muddy.
Last August he went up there dressed in a red bedquilt, and told Sam he was King Solomon,
and that the Queen of Sheba was coming to visit him. He fetched along all the money he
had&ndash;a little bag full of silver&ndash;and dropped it in Sam&rsquo;s well. &lsquo;She won&rsquo;t come,&rsquo; says old man
Redruth to Sam, &lsquo;if she knows I&rsquo;ve got any money.&rsquo;&ldquo;As soon as folks heard he had that sort of a theory about women and money they
knowed he was crazy; so they sent down and packed him to the foolish asylum.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Was there a romance in his life that drove him to a solitary existence?&rdquo; asked one of
the passengers, a young man who had an Agency.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bildad, &ldquo;not that I ever heard spoke of. Just ordinary trouble. They say he had
had unfortunateness in the way of love derangements with a young lady when he was young;
before he contracted red bed-quilts and had his financial conclusions disqualified. I never
heard of no romance.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Judge Menefee, impressively; &ldquo;a case of unrequited affection, no
doubt.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; returned Bildad, &ldquo;not at all. She never married him. Marmaduke Mulligan,
down at Paradise, seen a man once that come from old Redruth&rsquo;s town. He said Redruth was
a fine young man, but when you kicked him on the pocket all you could hear jingle was a
cuff-fastener and a bunch of keys. He was engaged to this young lady&ndash;Miss Alice&ndash;
something was her name; I&rsquo;ve forgot. This man said she was the kind of girl you like to have
reach across you in a car to pay the fare. Well, there come to the town a young chap all
affluent and easy, and fixed up with buggies and mining stock and leisure time. Although she
was a staked claim, Miss Alice and the new entry seemed to strike a mutual kind of a clip.
They had calls and coincidences of going to the post office and such things as sometimes
make a girl send back the engagement ring and other presents&ndash;&lsquo;a rift within the loot,&rsquo; the
poetry man calls it.
&ldquo;One day folks seen Redruth and Miss Alice standing talking at the gate. Then he lifts
his hat and walks away, and that was the last anybody in that town seen of him, as far as this
man knew.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What about the young lady?&rdquo; asked the young man who had an Agency.
&ldquo;Never heard,&rdquo; answered Bildad. &ldquo;Right there is where my lode of information turns to
an old spavined crowbait, and folds its wings, for I&rsquo;ve pumped it dry.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A very sad&ndash;&rdquo; began Judge Menefee, but his remark was curtailed by a higher
authority.
&ldquo;What a charming story!&rdquo; said the lady passenger, in flute-like tones.
A little silence followed, except for the wind and the crackling of the fire.The men were seated upon the floor, having slightly mitigated its inhospitable surface
with wraps and stray pieces of boards. The man who was placing Little Goliath windmills
arose and walked about to ease his cramped muscles.
Suddenly a triumphant shout came from him. He hurried back from a dusky corner of
the room, bearing aloft something in his hand. It was an apple&ndash;a large, red-mottled, firm
pippin, pleasing to behold. In a paper bag on a high shelf in that corner he had found it. It
could have been no relic of the lovewrecked Redruth, for its glorious soundness repudiated
the theory that it had lain on that musty shelf since August. No doubt some recent
bivouackers, lunching in the deserted house, had left it there.
Dunwoody&ndash;again his exploits demand for him the honours of nomenclature&ndash;flaunted
his apple in the faces of his fellow-marooners. &ldquo;See what I found, Mrs. McFarland!&rdquo; he cried,
vaingloriously. He held the apple high up in the light of the fire, where it glowed a still richer
red. The lady passenger smiled calmly&ndash;always calmly.
&ldquo;What a charming apple!&rdquo; she murmured, clearly.
For a brief space Judge Menefee felt crushed, humiliated, relegated. Second place
galled him. Why had this blatant, obtrusive, unpolished man of windmills been selected by
Fate instead of himself to discover the sensational apple? He could have made of the act a
scene, a function, a setting for some impromptu, fanciful discourse or piece of comedy&ndash;and
have retained the role of cynosure. Actually, the lady passenger was regarding this ridiculous
Dunboddy or Woodbundy with an admiring smile, as if the fellow had performed a feat! And
the windmill man swelled and gyrated like a sample of his own goods, puffed up with the
wind that ever blows from the chorus land toward the domain of the star.
While the transported Dunwoody, with his Aladdin&rsquo;s apple, was receiving the fickle
attentions of all, the resourceful jurist formed a plan to recover his own laurels.
With his courtliest smile upon his heavy but classic features, Judge Menefee advanced,
and took the apple, as if to examine it, from the hand of Dunwoody. In his hand it became
Exhibit A.
&ldquo;A fine apple,&rdquo; he said, approvingly. &ldquo;Really, my dear Mr. Dudwindy, you have eclipsed
all of us as a forager. But I have an idea. This apple shall become an emblem, a token, a
symbol, a prize bestowed by the mind and heart of beauty upon the most deserving.&rdquo;
The audience, except one, applauded. &ldquo;Good on the stump, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; commented the
passenger who was nobody in particular to the young man who had an Agency.
The unresponsive one was the windmill man. He saw himself reduced to the ranks.
Never would the thought have occurred to him to declare his apple an emblem. He had
intended, after it had been divided and eaten, to create diversion by sticking the seedsagainst his forehead and naming them for young ladies of his acquaintance. One he was
going to name Mrs. McFarland. The seed that fell off first would be&ndash;but &lsquo;twas too late now.
&ldquo;The apple,&rdquo; continued Judge Menefee, charging his jury, &ldquo;in modern days occupies,
though undeservedly, a lowly place in our esteem. Indeed, it is so constantly associated with
the culinary and the commercial that it is hardly to be classed among the polite fruits. But in
ancient times this was not so. Biblical, historical, and mythological lore abounds with
evidences that the apple was the aristocrat of fruits. We still say &lsquo;the apple of the eye&rsquo; when
we wish to describe something superlatively precious. We find in Proverbs the comparison
to &lsquo;apples of silver.&rsquo; No other product of tree or vine has been so utilised in figurative speech.
Who has not heard of and longed for the &lsquo;apples of the Hesperides&rsquo;? I need not call your
attention to the most tremendous and significant instance of the apple&rsquo;s ancient prestige
when its consumption by our first parents occasioned the fall of man from his state of
goodness and perfection.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Apples like them,&rdquo; said the windmill man, lingering with the objective article, &ldquo;are
worth $3.50 a barrel in the Chicago market.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Now, what I have to propose,&rdquo; said Judge Menefee, conceding an indulgent smile to
his interrupter, &ldquo;is this: We must remain here, perforce, until morning. We have wood in
plenty to keep us warm. Our next need is to entertain ourselves as best we can, in order that
the time shall not pass too slowly. I propose that we place this apple in the hands of Miss
Garland. It is no longer a fruit, but, as I said, a prize, in award, representing a great human
idea. Miss Garland, herself, shall cease to be an individual&ndash;but only temporarily, I am happy
to add&rdquo;&ndash;(a low bow, full of the old-time grace). &ldquo;She shall represent her sex; she shall be the
embodiment, the epitome of womankind&ndash;the heart and brain, I may say, of God&rsquo;s
masterpiece of creation. In this guise she shall judge and decide the question which follows:
&ldquo;But a few minutes ago our friend, Mr. Rose, favoured us with an entertaining but
fragmentary sketch of the romance in the life of the former professor of this habitation. The
few facts that we have learned seem to me to open up a fascinating field for conjecture, for
the study of human hearts, for the exercise of the imagination&ndash;in short, for story-telling. Let
us make use of the opportunity. Let each one of us relate his own version of the story of
Redruth, the hermit, and his lady-love, beginning where Mr. Rose&rsquo;s narrative ends&ndash;at the
parting of the lovers at the gate. This much should be assumed and conceded&ndash;that the
young lady was not necessarily to blame for Redruth&rsquo;s becoming a crazed and world-hating
hermit. When we have done, Miss Garland shall render the JUDGEMENT OF WOMAN. As
the Spirit of her Sex she shall decide which version of the story best and most truly depicts
human and love interest, and most faithfully estimates the character and acts of Redruth&rsquo;s
betrothed according to the feminine view. The apple shall be bestowed upon him who is
awarded the decision. If you are all agreed, we shall be pleased to hear the first story from
Mr. Dinwiddie.&rdquo;
The last sentence captured the windmill man. He was not one to linger in the dumps.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a first-rate scheme, Judge,&rdquo; he said, heartily. &ldquo;Be a regular short-story vaudeville,
won&rsquo;t it? I used to be correspondent for a paper in Springfield, and when there wasn&rsquo;t any
news I faked it. Guess I can do my turn all right.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I think the idea is charming,&rdquo; said the lady passenger, brightly. &ldquo;It will be almost like a
game.&rdquo;
Judge Menefee stepped forward and placed the apple in her hand impressively.
&ldquo;In olden days,&rdquo; he said, orotundly, &ldquo;Paris awarded the golden apple to the most
beautiful.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I was at the Exposition,&rdquo; remarked the windmill man, now cheerful again, &ldquo;but I never
heard of it. And I was on the Midway, too, all the time I wasn&rsquo;t at the machinery exhibit.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; continued the Judge, &ldquo;the fruit shall translate to us the mystery and wisdom
of the feminine heart. Take the apple, Miss Garland. Hear our modest tales of romance, and
then award the prize as you may deem it just.&rdquo;
The lady passenger smiled sweetly. The apple lay in her lap beneath her robes and
wraps. She reclined against her protecting bulwark, brightly and cosily at ease. But for the
voices and the wind one might have listened hopefully to hear her purr. Someone cast fresh
logs upon the fire. Judge Menefee nodded suavely. &ldquo;Will you oblige us with the initial
story?&rdquo; he asked.
The windmill man sat as sits a Turk, with his hat well back on his head on account of the
draughts.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began, without any embarrassment, &ldquo;this is about the way I size up the
difficulty: Of course Redruth was jostled a good deal by this duck who had money to play ball
with who tried to cut him out of his girl. So he goes around, naturally, and asks her if the
game is still square. Well, nobody wants a guy cutting in with buggies and gold bonds when
he&rsquo;s got an option on a girl. Well, he goes around to see her. Well, maybe he&rsquo;s hot, and talks
like the proprietor, and forgets that an engagement ain&rsquo;t always a lead-pipe cinch. Well, I
guess that makes Alice warm under the lacy yoke. Well, she answers back sharp. Well, he&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; interrupted the passenger who was nobody in particular, &ldquo;if you could put up a
windmill on every one of them &lsquo;wells&rsquo; you&rsquo;re using, you&rsquo;d be able to retire from business,
wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
The windmill man grinned good-naturedly.&ldquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t no Guy de Mopassong,&rdquo; he said, cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving it to you in straight
American. Well, she says something like this: &lsquo;Mr. Gold Bonds is only a friend,&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;but
he takes me riding and buys me theatre tickets, and that&rsquo;s what you never do. Ain&rsquo;t I to
never have any pleasure in life while I can?&rsquo; &lsquo;Pass this chatfield- chatfield thing along,&rsquo; says
Redruth;&ndash;&lsquo;hand out the mitt to the Willie with creases in it or you don&rsquo;t put your slippers
under my wardrobe.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Now that kind of train orders don&rsquo;t go with a girl that&rsquo;s got any spirit. I bet that girl
loved her honey all the time. Maybe she only wanted, as girls do, to work the good thing for
a little fun and caramels before she settled down to patch George&rsquo;s other pair, and be a good
wife. But he is glued to the high horse, and won&rsquo;t come down. Well, she hands him back the
ring, proper enough; and George goes away and hits the booze. Yep. That&rsquo;s what done it. I
bet that girl fired the cornucopia with the fancy vest two days after her steady left. George
boards a freight and checks his bag of crackers for parts unknown. He sticks to Old Booze for
a number of years; and then the aniline and aquafortis gets the decision. &lsquo;Me for the
hermit&rsquo;s hut,&rsquo; says George, &lsquo;and the long whiskers, and the buried can of money that isn&rsquo;t
there.&rsquo;
&ldquo;But that Alice, in my mind, was on the level. She never married, but took up
typewriting as soon as the wrinkles began to show, and kept a cat that came when you said
&lsquo;weeny&ndash;weeny&ndash;weeny!&rsquo; I got too much faith in good women to believe they throw down
the fellow they&rsquo;re stuck on every time for the dough.&rdquo; The windmill man ceased.
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the lady passenger, slightly moving upon her lowly throne, &ldquo;that that is a
char&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, Miss Garland!&rdquo; interposed Judge Menefee, with uplifted hand, &ldquo;I beg of you, no
comments! It would not be fair to the other contestants. Mr.&ndash;er&ndash;will you take the next
turn?&rdquo; The Judge addressed the young man who had the Agency.
&ldquo;My version of the romance,&rdquo; began the young man, diffidently clasping his hands,
&ldquo;would be this: They did not quarrel when they parted. Mr. Redruth bade her good-by and
went out into the world to seek his fortune. He knew his love would remain true to him. He
scorned the thought that his rival could make an impression upon a heart so fond and
faithful. I would say that Mr. Redruth went out to the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming to seek
for gold. One day a crew of pirates landed and captured him while at work, and&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hey! what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; sharply called the passenger who was nobody in particular&ndash;&ldquo;a crew
of pirates landed in the Rocky Mountains! Will you tell us how they sailed&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Landed from a train,&rdquo; said the narrator, quietly and not without some readiness. &ldquo;They
kept him prisoner in a cave for months, and then they took him hundreds of miles away to
the forests of Alaska. There a beautiful Indian girl fell in love with him, but he remained true
to Alice. After another year of wandering in the woods, he set out with the diamonds&ndash;&ldquo;&ldquo;What diamonds?&rdquo; asked the unimportant passenger, almost with acerbity.
&ldquo;The ones the saddlemaker showed him in the Peruvian temple,&rdquo; said the other,
somewhat obscurely. &ldquo;When he reached home, Alice&rsquo;s mother led him, weeping, to a green
mound under a willow tree. &lsquo;Her heart was broken when you left,&rsquo; said her mother. &lsquo;And
what of my rival&ndash;of Chester McIntosh?&rsquo; asked Mr. Redruth, as he knelt sadly by Alice&rsquo;s grave.
&lsquo;When he found out,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;that her heart was yours, he pined away day by day
until, at length, he started a furniture store in Grand Rapids. We heard lately that he was
bitten to death by an infuriated moose near South Bend, Ind., where he had gone to try to
forget scenes of civilisation.&rsquo; With which, Mr. Redruth forsook the face of mankind and
became a hermit, as we have seen.
&ldquo;My story,&rdquo; concluded the young man with an Agency, &ldquo;may lack the literary quality;
but what I wanted it to show is that the young lady remained true. She cared nothing for
wealth in comparison with true affection. I admire and believe in the fair sex too much to
think otherwise.&rdquo;
The narrator ceased, with a sidelong glance at the corner where reclined the lady
passenger.
Bildad Rose was next invited by Judge Menefee to contribute his story in the contest for
the apple of judgment. The stage-driver&rsquo;s essay was brief.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one of them lobo wolves,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who are always blaming on women the
calamities of life. My testimony in regards to the fiction story you ask for, Judge, will be
about as follows: What ailed Redruth was pure laziness. If he had up and slugged this
Percival De Lacey that tried to give him the outside of the road, and had kept Alice in the
grape-vine swing with the blind-bridle on, all would have been well. The woman you want is
sure worth taking pains for.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Send for me if you want me again,&rsquo; says Redruth, and hoists his Stetson, and walks off.
He&rsquo;d have called it pride, but the nixycomlogical name for it is laziness. No woman don&rsquo;t like
to run after a man. &lsquo;Let him come back, hisself,&rsquo; says the girl; and I&rsquo;ll be bound she tells the
boy with the pay ore to trot; and then spends her time watching out the window for the
man with the empty pocket-book and the tickly moustache.
&ldquo;I reckon Redruth waits about nine year expecting her to send him a note by a nigger
asking him to forgive her. But she don&rsquo;t. &lsquo;This game won&rsquo;t work,&rsquo; says Redruth; &lsquo;then so won&rsquo;t
I.&rsquo; And he goes in the hermit business and raises whiskers. Yes; laziness and whiskers was
what done the trick. They travel together. You ever hear of a man with long whiskers and
hair striking a bonanza? No. Look at the Duke of Marlborough and this Standard Oil snoozer.
Have they got &lsquo;em?&ldquo;Now, this Alice didn&rsquo;t never marry, I&rsquo;ll bet a hoss. If Redruth had married somebody
else she might have done so, too. But he never turns up. She has these here things they call
fond memories, and maybe a lock of hair and a corset steel that he broke, treasured up.
Them sort of articles is as good as a husband to some women. I&rsquo;d say she played out a lone
hand. I don&rsquo;t blame no woman for old man Redruth&rsquo;s abandonment of barber shops and
clean shirts.&rdquo;
Next in order came the passenger who was nobody in particular. Nameless to us, he
travels the road from Paradise to Sunrise City.
But him you shall see, if the firelight be not too dim, as he responds to the Judge&rsquo;s call.
A lean form, in rusty-brown clothing, sitting like a frog, his arms wrapped about his legs,
his chin resting upon his knees. Smooth, oakum-coloured hair; long nose; mouth like a
satyr&rsquo;s, with upturned, tobacco-stained corners. An eye like a fish&rsquo;s; a red necktie with a
horseshoe pin. He began with a rasping chuckle that gradually formed itself into words.
&ldquo;Everybody wrong so far. What! a romance without any orange blossoms! Ho, ho! My
money on the lad with the butterfly tie and the certified checks in his trouserings.
&ldquo;Take &lsquo;em as they parted at the gate? All right. &lsquo;You never loved me,&rsquo; says Redruth,
wildly, &lsquo;or you wouldn&rsquo;t speak to a man who can buy you the ice-cream.&rsquo; &lsquo;I hate him,&rsquo; says
she. &lsquo;I loathe his side-bar buggy; I despise the elegant cream bonbons he sends me in gilt
boxes covered with real lace; I feel that I could stab him to the heart when he presents me
with a solid medallion locket with turquoises and pearls running in a vine around the border.
Away with him! &lsquo;Tis only you I love.&rsquo; &lsquo;Back to the cosey corner!&rsquo; says Redruth. &lsquo;Was I bound
and lettered in East Aurora? Get platonic, if you please. No jack-pots for mine. Go and hate
your friend some more. For me the Nickerson girl on Avenue B, and gum, and a trolley ride.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Around that night comes John W. Croesus. &lsquo;What! tears?&rsquo; says he, arranging his pearl
pin. &lsquo;You have driven my lover away,&rsquo; says little Alice, sobbing: &lsquo;I hate the sight of you.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Marry me, then,&rsquo; says John W., lighting a Henry Clay. &lsquo;What!&rsquo; she cries indignantly, &lsquo;marry
you! Never,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;until this blows over, and I can do some shopping, and you see about
the licence. There&rsquo;s a telephone next door if you want to call up the county clerk.&lsquo;&rdquo;
The narrator paused to give vent to his cynical chuckle.
&ldquo;Did they marry?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Did the duck swallow the June-bug? And then I take
up the case of Old Boy Redruth. There&rsquo;s where you are all wrong again, according to my
theory. What turned him into a hermit? One says laziness; one says remorse; one says booze.
I say women did it. How old is the old man now?&rdquo; asked the speaker, turning to Bildad Rose.
&ldquo;I should say about sixty-five.&rdquo;&ldquo;All right. He conducted his hermit shop here for twenty years. Say he was twenty-five
when he took off his hat at the gate. That leaves twenty years for him to account for, or else
be docked. Where did he spend that ten and two fives? I&rsquo;ll give you my idea. Up for bigamy.
Say there was the fat blonde in Saint Jo, and the panatela brunette at Skillet Ridge, and the
gold tooth down in the Kaw valley. Redruth gets his cases mixed, and they send him up the
road. He gets out after they are through with him, and says: &lsquo;Any line for me except the
crinoline. The hermit trade is not overdone, and the stenographers never apply to &lsquo;em for
work. The jolly hermit&rsquo;s life for me. No more long hairs in the comb or dill pickles lying
around in the cigar tray.&rsquo; You tell me they pinched old Redruth for the noodle villa just
because he said he was King Solomon? Figs! He was Solomon. That&rsquo;s all of mine. I guess it
don&rsquo;t call for any apples. Enclosed find stamps. It don&rsquo;t sound much like a prize winner.&rdquo;
Respecting the stricture laid by Judge Menefee against comments upon the stories, all
were silent when the passenger who was nobody in particular had concluded. And then the
ingenious originator of the contest cleared his throat to begin the ultimate entry for the
prize. Though seated with small comfort upon the floor, you might search in vain for any
abatement of dignity in Judge Menefee. The now diminishing firelight played softly upon his
face, as clearly chiselled as a Roman emperor&rsquo;s on some old coin, and upon the thick waves
of his honourable grey hair.
&ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s heart!&rdquo; he began, in even but thrilling tones&ndash;&ldquo;who can hope to fathom it?
The ways and desires of men are various. I think that the hearts of all women beat with the
same rhythm, and to the same old tune of love. Love, to a woman, means sacrifice. If she be
worthy of the name, no gold or rank will outweigh with her a genuine devotion.
&ldquo;Gentlemen of the&ndash;er&ndash;I should say, my friends, the case of Redruth versus love and
affection has been called. Yet, who is on trial? Not Redruth, for he has been punished. Not
those immortal passions that clothe our lives with the joy of the angels. Then who? Each
man of us here to-night stands at the bar to answer if chivalry or darkness inhabits his
bosom. To judge us sits womankind in the form of one of its fairest flowers. In her hand she
holds the prize, intrinsically insignificant, but worthy of our noblest efforts to win as a
guerdon of approval from so worthy a representative of feminine judgment and taste.
&ldquo;In taking up the imaginary history of Redruth and the fair being to whom he gave his
heart, I must, in the beginning, raise my voice against the unworthy insinuation that the
selfishness or perfidy or love of luxury of any woman drove him to renounce the world. I
have not found woman to be so unspiritual or venal. We must seek elsewhere, among man&rsquo;s
baser nature and lower motives for the cause.
&ldquo;There was, in all probability, a lover&rsquo;s quarrel as they stood at the gate on that
memorable day. Tormented by jealousy, young Redruth vanished from his native haunts. But
had he just cause to do so? There is no evidence for or against. But there is something
higher than evidence; there is the grand, eternal belief in woman&rsquo;s goodness, in her
steadfastness against temptation, in her loyalty even in the face of proffered riches.&ldquo;I picture to myself the rash lover, wandering, self-tortured, about the world. I picture
his gradual descent, and, finally, his complete despair when he realises that he has lost the
most precious gift life had to offer him. Then his withdrawal from the world of sorrow and
the subsequent derangement of his faculties becomes intelligible.
&ldquo;But what do I see on the other hand? A lonely woman fading away as the years roll by;
still faithful, still waiting, still watching for a form and listening for a step that will come no
more. She is old now. Her hair is white and smoothly banded. Each day she sits at the door
and gazes longingly down the dusty road. In spirit she is waiting there at the gate, just as he
left her&ndash;his forever, but not here below. Yes; my belief in woman paints that picture in my
mind. Parted forever on earth, but waiting! She in anticipation of a meeting in Elysium; he in
the Slough of Despond.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I thought he was in the bughouse,&rdquo; said the passenger who was nobody in particular.
Judge Menefee stirred, a little impatiently. The men sat, drooping, in grotesque
attitudes. The wind had abated its violence; coming now in fitful, virulent puffs. The fire had
burned to a mass of red coals which shed but a dim light within the room. The lady
passenger in her cosey nook looked to be but a formless dark bulk, crowned by a mass of
coiled, sleek hair and showing but a small space of snowy forehead above her clinging boa.
Judge Menefee got stiffly to his feet.
&ldquo;And now, Miss Garland,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;we have concluded. It is for you to award the
prize to the one of us whose argument&ndash;especially, I may say, in regard to his estimate of true
womanhood&ndash;approaches nearest to your own conception.&rdquo;
No answer came from the lady passenger. Judge Menefee bent over solicitously. The
passenger who was nobody in particular laughed low and harshly. The lady was sleeping
sweetly. The Judge essayed to take her hand to awaken her. In doing so he touched a small,
cold, round, irregular something in her lap.
&ldquo;She has eaten the apple,&rdquo; announced Judge Menefee, in awed tones, as he held up the
core for them to see.
Springtime a la Carte （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>It was a day in March.Never, never begin a story this way when you write one. No opening could possibly be
worse. It is unimaginative, flat, dry and likely to consist of mere wind. But in this instance it
is allowable. For the following paragraph, which should have inaugurated the narrative, is
too wildly extravagant and preposterous to be flaunted in the face of the reader without
preparation.
Sarah was crying over her bill of fare.
Think of a New York girl shedding tears on the menu card!
To account for this you will be allowed to guess that the lobsters were all out, or that
she had sworn ice-cream off during Lent, or that she had ordered onions, or that she had
just come from a Hackett matinee. And then, all these theories being wrong, you will please
let the story proceed.
The gentleman who announced that the world was an oyster which he with his sword
would open made a larger hit than he deserved. It is not difficult to open an oyster with a
sword. But did you ever notice any one try to open the terrestrial bivalve with a typewriter?
Like to wait for a dozen raw opened that way?
Sarah had managed to pry apart the shells with her unhandy weapon far enough to
nibble a wee bit at the cold and clammy world within. She knew no more shorthand than if
she had been a graduate in stenography just let slip upon the world by a business college. So,
not being able to stenog, she could not enter that bright galaxy of office talent. She was a
free-lance typewriter and canvassed for odd jobs of copying.
The most brilliant and crowning feat of Sarah&rsquo;s battle with the world was the deal she
made with Schulenberg&rsquo;s Home Restaurant. The restaurant was next door to the old red
brick in which she ball- roomed. One evening after dining at Schulenberg&rsquo;s 40-cent, fivecourse table d&rsquo;hote (served as fast as you throw the five baseballs at the coloured
gentleman&rsquo;s head) Sarah took away with her the bill of fare. It was written in an almost
unreadable script neither English nor German, and so arranged that if you were not careful
you began with a toothpick and rice pudding and ended with soup and the day of the week.
The next day Sarah showed Schulenberg a neat card on which the menu was beautifully
typewritten with the viands temptingly marshalled under their right and proper heads from
&ldquo;hors d&rsquo;oeuvre&rdquo; to &ldquo;not responsible for overcoats and umbrellas.&rdquo;
Schulenberg became a naturalised citizen on the spot. Before Sarah left him she had
him willingly committed to an agreement. She was to furnish typewritten bills of fare for the
twenty-one tables in the restaurant&ndash;a new bill for each day&rsquo;s dinner, and new ones for
breakfast and lunch as often as changes occurred in the food or as neatness required.In return for this Schulenberg was to send three meals per diem to Sarah&rsquo;s hall room by
a waiter&ndash;an obsequious one if possible&ndash;and furnish her each afternoon with a pencil draft
of what Fate had in store for Schulenberg&rsquo;s customers on the morrow.
Mutual satisfaction resulted from the agreement. Schulenberg&rsquo;s patrons now knew
what the food they ate was called even if its nature sometimes puzzled them. And Sarah had
food during a cold, dull winter, which was the main thing with her.
And then the almanac lied, and said that spring had come. Spring comes when it comes.
The frozen snows of January still lay like adamant in the crosstown streets. The hand-organs
still played &ldquo;In the Good Old Summertime,&rdquo; with their December vivacity and expression.
Men began to make thirty-day notes to buy Easter dresses. Janitors shut off steam. And
when these things happen one may know that the city is still in the clutches of winter.
One afternoon Sarah shivered in her elegant hall bedroom; &ldquo;house heated; scrupulously
clean; conveniences; seen to be appreciated.&rdquo; She had no work to do except Schulenberg&rsquo;s
menu cards. Sarah sat in her squeaky willow rocker, and looked out the window. The
calendar on the wall kept crying to her: &ldquo;Springtime is here, Sarah&ndash; springtime is here, I tell
you. Look at me, Sarah, my figures show it. You&rsquo;ve got a neat figure yourself, Sarah&ndash;a&ndash;nice
springtime figure&ndash;why do you look out the window so sadly?&rdquo;
Sarah&rsquo;s room was at the back of the house. Looking out the window she could see the
windowless rear brick wall of the box factory on the next street. But the wall was clearest
crystal; and Sarah was looking down a grassy lane shaded with cherry trees and elms and
bordered with raspberry bushes and Cherokee roses.
Spring&rsquo;s real harbingers are too subtle for the eye and ear. Some must have the
flowering crocus, the wood-starring dogwood, the voice of bluebird&ndash;even so gross a
reminder as the farewell handshake of the retiring buckwheat and oyster before they can
welcome the Lady in Green to their dull bosoms. But to old earth&rsquo;s choicest kin there come
straight, sweet messages from his newest bride, telling them they shall be no stepchildren
unless they choose to be.
On the previous summer Sarah had gone into the country and loved a farmer.
(In writing your story never hark back thus. It is bad art, and cripples interest. Let it
march, march.)
Sarah stayed two weeks at Sunnybrook Farm. There she learned to love old Farmer
Franklin&rsquo;s son Walter. Farmers have been loved and wedded and turned out to grass in less
time. But young Walter Franklin was a modern agriculturist. He had a telephone in his cow
house, and he could figure up exactly what effect next year&rsquo;s Canada wheat crop would have
on potatoes planted in the dark of the moon.It was in this shaded and raspberried lane that Walter had wooed and won her. And
together they had sat and woven a crown of dandelions for her hair. He had immoderately
praised the effect of the yellow blossoms against her brown tresses; and she had left the
chaplet there, and walked back to the house swinging her straw sailor in her hands.
They were to marry in the spring&ndash;at the very first signs of spring, Walter said. And
Sarah came back to the city to pound her typewriter.
A knock at the door dispelled Sarah&rsquo;s visions of that happy day. A waiter had brought
the rough pencil draft of the Home Restaurant&rsquo;s next day fare in old Schulenberg&rsquo;s angular
hand.
Sarah sat down to her typewriter and slipped a card between the rollers. She was a
nimble worker. Generally in an hour and a half the twenty-one menu cards were written and
ready.
To-day there were more changes on the bill of fare than usual. The soups were lighter;
pork was eliminated from the entrees, figuring only with Russian turnips among the roasts.
The gracious spirit of spring pervaded the entire menu. Lamb, that lately capered on the
greening hillsides, was becoming exploited with the sauce that commemorated its gambols.
The song of the oyster, though not silenced, was diminuendo con amore. The frying-pan
seemed to be held, inactive, behind the beneficent bars of the broiler. The pie list swelled;
the richer puddings had vanished; the sausage, with his drapery wrapped about him, barely
lingered in a pleasant thanatopsis with the buckwheats and the sweet but doomed maple.
Sarah&rsquo;s fingers danced like midgets above a summer stream. Down through the courses
she worked, giving each item its position according to its length with an accurate eye. Just
above the desserts came the list of vegetables. Carrots and peas, asparagus on toast, the
perennial tomatoes and corn and succotash, lima beans, cabbage&ndash;and then&ndash;
Sarah was crying over her bill of fare. Tears from the depths of some divine despair rose
in her heart and gathered to her eyes. Down went her head on the little typewriter stand;
and the keyboard rattled a dry accompaniment to her moist sobs.
For she had received no letter from Walter in two weeks, and the next item on the bill
of fare was dandelions&ndash;dandelions with some kind of egg&ndash;but bother the egg!&ndash;dandelions,
with whose golden blooms Walter had crowned her his queen of love and future
bride&ndash;dandelions, the harbingers of spring, her sorrow&rsquo;s crown of sorrow&ndash;reminder of her
happiest days.
Madam, I dare you to smile until you suffer this test: Let the Marechal Niel roses that
Percy brought you on the night you gave him your heart be served as a salad with French
dressing before your eyes at a Schulenberg table d&rsquo;hote. Had Juliet so seen her love tokens
dishonoured the sooner would she have sought the lethean herbs of the good apothecary.But what a witch is Spring! Into the great cold city of stone and iron a message had to
be sent. There was none to convey it but the little hardy courier of the fields with his rough
green coat and modest air. He is a true soldier of fortune, this dent-de-lion&ndash; this lion&rsquo;s tooth,
as the French chefs call him. Flowered, he will assist at love-making, wreathed in my lady&rsquo;s
nut-brown hair; young and callow and unblossomed, he goes into the boiling pot and
delivers the word of his sovereign mistress.
By and by Sarah forced back her tears. The cards must be written. But, still in a faint,
golden glow from her dandeleonine dream, she fingered the typewriter keys absently for a
little while, with her mind and heart in the meadow lane with her young farmer. But soon
she came swiftly back to the rock-bound lanes of Manhattan, and the typewriter began to
rattle and jump like a strike-breaker&rsquo;s motor car.
At 6 o&rsquo;clock the waiter brought her dinner and carried away the typewritten bill of fare.
When Sarah ate she set aside, with a sigh, the dish of dandelions with its crowning ovarious
accompaniment. As this dark mass had been transformed from a bright and love-indorsed
flower to be an ignominious vegetable, so had her summer hopes wilted and perished. Love
may, as Shakespeare said, feed on itself: but Sarah could not bring herself to eat the
dandelions that had graced, as ornaments, the first spiritual banquet of her heart&rsquo;s true
affection.
At 7:30 the couple in the next room began to quarrel: the man in the room above
sought for A on his flute; the gas went a little lower; three coal wagons started to
unload&ndash;the only sound of which the phonograph is jealous; cats on the back fences slowly
retreated toward Mukden. By these signs Sarah knew that it was time for her to read. She
got out &ldquo;The Cloister and the Hearth,&rdquo; the best non- selling book of the month, settled her
feet on her trunk, and began to wander with Gerard.
The front door bell rang. The landlady answered it. Sarah left Gerard and Denys treed
by a bear and listened. Oh, yes; you would, just as she did!
And then a strong voice was heard in the hall below, and Sarah jumped for her door,
leaving the book on the floor and the first round easily the bear&rsquo;s. You have guessed it. She
reached the top of the stairs just as her farmer came up, three at a jump, and reaped and
garnered her, with nothing left for the gleaners.
&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you written&ndash;oh, why?&rdquo; cried Sarah.
&ldquo;New York is a pretty large town,&rdquo; said Walter Franklin. &ldquo;I came in a week ago to your
old address. I found that you went away on a Thursday. That consoled some; it eliminated
the possible Friday bad luck. But it didn&rsquo;t prevent my hunting for you with police and
otherwise ever since!&ldquo;I wrote!&rdquo; said Sarah, vehemently.
&ldquo;Never got it!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then how did you find me?&rdquo;
The young farmer smiled a springtime smile. &ldquo;I dropped into that Home Restaurant
next door this evening,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who knows it; I like a dish of some kind of
greens at this time of the year. I ran my eye down that nice typewritten bill of fare looking
for something in that line. When I got below cabbage I turned my chair over and hollered for
the proprietor. He told me where you lived.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; sighed Sarah, happily. &ldquo;That was dandelions below cabbage.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d know that cranky capital W &lsquo;way above the line that your typewriter makes
anywhere in the world,&rdquo; said Franklin.
&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s no W in dandelions,&rdquo; said Sarah, in surprise.
The young man drew the bill of fare from his pocket, and pointed to a line.
Sarah recognised the first card she had typewritten that afternoon. There was still the
rayed splotch in the upper right-hand corner where a tear had fallen. But over the spot
where one should have read the name of the meadow plant, the clinging memory of their
golden blossoms had allowed her fingers to strike strange keys.
Between the red cabbage and the stuffed green peppers was the item:
&ldquo;DEAREST WALTER, WITH HARD-BOILED EGG.&rdquo;
Strictly Business （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>I suppose you know all about the stage and stage people. You&rsquo;ve been touched with
and by actors, and you read the newspaper criticisms and the jokes in the weeklies about
the Rialto and the chorus girls and the long-haired tragedians. And I suppose that a
condensed list of your ideas about the mysterious stageland would boil down to something
like this:
Leading ladies have five husbands, paste diamonds, and figures no better than your
own (madam) if they weren&rsquo;t padded. Chorus girls are inseparable from peroxide, Panhardsand Pittsburg. All shows walk back to New York on tan oxford and railroad ties.
Irreproachable actresses reserve the comic-landlady part for their mothers on Broadway and
their step-aunts on the road. Kyrle Bellew&rsquo;s real name is Boyle O&rsquo;Kelley. The ravings of John
McCullough in the phonograph were stolen from the first sale of the Ellen Terry memoirs.
Joe Weber is funnier than E. H. Sothern; but Henry Miller is getting older than he was.
All theatrical people on leaving the theatre at night drink champagne and eat lobsters
until noon the next day. After all, the moving pictures have got the whole bunch pounded to
a pulp.
Now, few of us know the real life of the stage people. If we did, the profession might be
more overcrowded than it is. We look askance at the players with an eye full of patronizing
superiority - and we go home and practise all sorts of elocution and gestures in front of our
looking glasses.
Latterly there has been much talk of the actor people in a new light. It seems to have
been divulged that instead of being motoring bacchanalias and diamond-hungry loreleis
they are businesslike folk, students and ascetics with children and homes and libraries,
owning real estate, and conducting their private affairs in as orderly and unsensational a
manner as any of us good citizens who are bound to the chariot wheels of the gas, rent, coal,
ice, and wardmen.
Whether the old or the new report of the sock-and-buskiners be the true one is a
surmise that has no place here. I offer you merely this little story of two strollers; and for
proof of its truth I can show you only the dark patch above the cast-iron of the
stage-entrance door of Keetor&rsquo;s old vaudeville theatre made there by the petulant push of
gloved hands too impatient to finger the clumsy thumb-latch - and where I last saw Cherry
whisking through like a swallow into her nest, on time to the minute, as usual, to dress for
her act.
The vaudeville team of Hart &amp; Cherry was an inspiration. But Hart had been roaming
through the Eastern and Western circuits for four years with a mixed-up act comprising a
monologue, three lightning changes with songs, a couple of imitations of celebrated
imitators, and a buck-and-wing dance that had drawn a glance of approval from the bass-viol
player in more than one house - than which no performer ever received more satisfactory
evidence of good work.
The greatest treat an actor can have is to witness the pitiful performance with which all
other actors desecrate the stage. In order to give himself this pleausre he will often forsake
the sunniest Broadway corner between Thirty-fourth and Forty-fourth to attend a matinee
offering by his less gifted brothers. Once during the lifetime of a minstrel joke one comes to
scoff and remains to go through with that most difficult exercise of Thespian muscles - the
audible contact of the palm of one hand against the palm of the other.One afternoon Bob Hart presented his solvent, serious, well-known vaudevillian face at
the box-office window of a rival attraction and got his d. h. coupon for an orchestra seat.
A, B, C, and D glowed successively on the announcement spaces and passed into
oblivion, each plunging Mr. Hart deeper into gloom. Others of the audience shrieked,
squirmed, whistled, and applauded; but Bob Hart, &ldquo;All the Mustard and a Whole Show in
Himself,&rdquo; sat with his face as long and his hands as far apart as a boy holding a hank of yarn
for his grandmother to wind into a ball.
But when H came on, &ldquo;The Mustard&rdquo; suddenly sat up straight. H was the happy
alphabetical prognosticator of Winona Cherry, in Character Songs and Impersonations.
There were scarcely more than two bites to Cherry; but she delivered the merchandise tied
with a pink cord and charged to the old man&rsquo;s account. She first showed you a deliciously
dewy and ginghamy country girl with a basket of property daisies who informed you
ingenuously that there were other things to be learned at the old log school-house besides
cipherin&rsquo; and nouns, especially &ldquo;When the Teach-er Kept Me in.&rdquo; Vanishing, with a quick flirt
of gingham apron-strings, she reappeared in considerably less than a &ldquo;trice&rdquo; as a fluffy
&ldquo;Parisienne&rdquo; - so near does Art bring the old red mill to the Moulin Rouge. And then -
But you know the rest. And so did Bob Hart; but he saw somebody else. He thought he
saw that Cherry was the only professional on the short order stage that he had seen who
seemed exactly to fit the part of &ldquo;Helen Grimes&rdquo; in the sketch he had written and kept
tucked away in the tray of his trunk. Of course Bob Hart, as well as every other normal actor,
grocer, newspaper man, professor, curb broker, and farmer, has a play tucked away
somewhere. They tuck &lsquo;em in trays of trunks, trunks of trees, desks, haymows, pigeonholes,
inside pockets, safe-deposit vaults, handboxes, and coal cellars, waiting for Mr. Frohman to
call. They belong among the fifty-seven different kinds.
But Bob Hart&rsquo;s sketch was not destined to end in a pickle jar. He called it &ldquo;Mice Will
Play.&rdquo; He had kept it quiet and hidden away ever since he wrote it, waiting to find a partner
who fitted his conception of &ldquo;Helen Grimes.&rdquo; And here was &ldquo;Helen&rdquo; herself, with all the
innocent abandon, the youth, the sprightliness, and the flawless stage art that his critical
taste demanded.
After the act was over Hart found the manager in the box office, and got Cherry&rsquo;s
address. At five the next afternoon he called at the musty old house in the West Forties and
sent up his professional card.
By daylight, in a secular shirtwaist and plain voile skirt, with her hair curbed and her
Sister of Charity eyes, Winona Cherry might have been playing the part of Prudence Wise,
the deacon&rsquo;s daughter, in the great (unwritten) New England drama not yet entitled
anything.&ldquo;I know your act, Mr. Hart,&rdquo; she said after she had looked over his card carefully. &ldquo;What
did you wish to see me about?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I saw you work last night,&rdquo; said Hart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve written a sketch that I&rsquo;ve been saving up. It&rsquo;s
for two; and I think you can do the other part. I thought I&rsquo;d see you about it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Come in the parlor,&rdquo; said Miss Cherry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wishing for something of the sort. I
think I&rsquo;d like to act instead of doing turns.&rdquo;
Bob Hart drew his cherished &ldquo;Mice Will Play&rdquo; from his pocket, and read it to her.
&ldquo;Read it again, please,&rdquo; said Miss Cherry.
And then she pointed out to him clearly how it could be improved by introducing a
messenger instead of a telephone call, and cutting the dialogue just before the climax while
they were struggling with the pistol, and by completely changing the lines and business of
Helen Grimes at the point where her jealousy overcomes her. Hart yielded to all her
strictures without argument. She had at once put her finger on the sketch&rsquo;s weaker points.
That was her woman&rsquo;s intuition that he had lacked. At the end of their talk Hart was willing
to stake the judgment, experience, and savings of his four years of vaudeville that &ldquo;Mice Will
Play&rdquo; would blossom into a perennial flower in the garden of the circuits. Miss Cherry was
slower to decide. After many puckerings of her smooth young brow and tappings on her
small, white teeth with the end of a lead pencil she gave out her dictum.
&ldquo;Mr. Hart,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I believe your sketch is going to win out. That Grimes part fits me
like a shrinkable flannel after its first trip to a handless hand laundry. I can make it stand out
like the colonel of the Forty-fourth Regiment at a Little Mothers&rsquo; Bazaar. And I&rsquo;ve seen you
work. I know what you can do with the other part. But business is business. How much do
you get a week for the stunt you do now?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Two hundred,&rdquo; answered Hart.
&ldquo;I get one hundred for mine,&rdquo; said Cherry. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the natural discount for a
woman. But I live on it and put a few simoleons every week under the loose brick in the old
kitchen hearth. The stage is all right. I love it; but there&rsquo;s something else I love better - that&rsquo;s
a little country home, some day, with Plymouth Rock chickens and six ducks wandering
around the yard.
&ldquo;Now, let me tell you, Mr. Hart, I am STRICTLY BUSINESS. If you want me to play the
opposite part in your sketch, I&rsquo;ll do it. And I believe we can make it go. And there&rsquo;s
something else I want to say: There&rsquo;s no nonsense in my make-up; I&rsquo;m on the level, and I&rsquo;m
on the stage for what it pays me, just as other girls work in stores and offices. I&rsquo;m going to
save my money to keep me when I&rsquo;m past doing my stunts. No Old Ladies&rsquo; Home or Retreat
for Imprudent Actresses for me.&ldquo;If you want to make this a business partnership, Mr. Hart, with all nonsense cut out of
it, I&rsquo;m in on it. I know something about vaudeville teams in general; but this would have to
be one in particular. I want you to know that I&rsquo;m on the stage for what I can cart away from it
every pay-day in a little manila envelope with nicotine stains on it, where the cashier has
licked the flap. It&rsquo;s kind of a hobby of mine to want to cravenette myself for plenty of rainy
days in the future. I want you to know just how I am. I don&rsquo;t know what an all-night
restaurant looks like; I drink only weak tea; I never spoke to a man at a stage entrance in my
life, and I&rsquo;ve got money in five savings banks.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Miss Cherry,&rdquo; said Bob Hart in his smooth, serious tones, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re in on your own terms.
I&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;strictly business&rsquo; pasted in my hat and stenciled on my make-up box. When I dream
of nights I always see a five-room bungalow on the north shore of Long Island, with a Jap
cooking clam broth and duckling in the kitchen, and me with the title deeds to the place in
my pongee coat pocket, swinging in a hammock on the side porch, reading Stanleys
&lsquo;Explorations into Africa.&rsquo; And nobody else around. You never was interested in Africa, was
you, Miss Cherry?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not any,&rdquo; said Cherry. &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m going to do with my money is to bank it. You can get
four percent on deposits. Even at the salary I&rsquo;ve been earning, I&rsquo;ve figured out that in ten
years I&rsquo;d have an income of about $50 a month just from the interest alone. Well, I might
invest some of the principal in a little business - say, trimming hats or a beauty parlor, and
make more.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hart, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the proper idea all right, all right, anyhow. There are
mighty few actors that amount to anything at all who couldn&rsquo;t fix themselves for the wet
days to come if they&rsquo;d save their money instead of blowing it. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve got the correct
business idea of it, Miss Cherry. I think the same way; and I believe this sketch will more
than double what both of us earn now when we get it shaped up.&rdquo;
The subsequent history of &ldquo;Mice Will Play&rdquo; is the history of all successful writings for
the stage. Hart &amp; Cherry cut it, pieced it, remodeled it, performed surgical operations on the
dialogue and business, changed the lines, restored &lsquo;em, added more, cut &lsquo;em out, renamed it,
gave it back the old name, rewrote it, substituted a dagger for the pistol, restored the pistol -
put the sketch through all the known processes of condensation and improvement.
They rehearsed it by the old-fashioned boardinghouse clock in the rarely used parlor
until its warning click at five minutes to the hour would occur every time exactly half a
second before the click of the unloaded revolver that Helen Grimes used in rehearsing the
thrilling climax of the sketch.
Yes, that was a thriller and a piece of excellent work. In the act a real 32-caliber revolver
was used loaded with a real cartridge. Helen Grimes, who is a Western girl of decidedly
Buffalo Billish skill and daring, is tempestuously in love with Frank Desmond, the privatesecretary and confidential prospective son-in-law of her father, &ldquo;Arapahoe&rdquo; Grimes,
quarter-million-dollar cattle king, owning a ranch that, judging by the scenery, is in either
the Bad Lands or Amagensett, L. I. Desmond (in private life Mr. Bob Hart) wears puttees and
Meadow Brook Hunt riding trousers, and gives his address as New York, leaving you to
wonder why he comes to the Bad Lands or Amagansett (as the case may be) and at the same
time to conjecture mildly why a cattleman should want puttees about his ranch with a
secretary in &lsquo;em.
Well, anyhow, you know as well as I do that we all like that kind of play, whether we
admit it or not - something along in between &ldquo;Bluebeard, Jr.,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo; played in the
Russian.
There were only two parts and a half in &ldquo;Mice Will Play.&rdquo; Hart and Cherry were the two,
of course; and the half was a minor part always played by a stage hand, who merely came in
once in a Tuxedo coat and a panic to announce that the house was surrounded by Indians,
and to turn down the gas fire in the grate by the manager&rsquo;s orders.
There was another girl in the sketch - a Fifth Avenue society swelless - who was visiting
the ranch and who had sirened Jack Valentine when he was a wealthy club-man on lower
Third Avenue before he lost his money. This girl appeared on the stage only in the
photographic state - Jack had her Sarony stuck up on the mantel of the Amagan - of the Bad
Lands droring room. Helen was jealous, of course.
And now for the thriller. Old &ldquo;Arapahoe&rdquo; Grimes dies of angina pectoris one night - so
Helen informs us in a stage-ferryboat whisper over the footlights - while only his secretary
was present. And that same day he was known to have had $647,000 in cash in his (ranch)
library just received for the sale of a drove of beeves in the East (that accounts for the price
we pay for steak!). The cash disappears at the same time. Jack Valentine was the only person
with the ranchman when he made his (alleged) croak.
&ldquo;Gawd knows I love him; but if he has done this deed -&rdquo; you sabe, don&rsquo;t you? And then
there are some mean things said about the Fifth Avenue Girl - who doesn&rsquo;t come on the
stage - and can we blame her, with the vaudeville trust holding down prices until one
actually must be buttoned in the back by a call boy, maids cost so much?
But, wait. Here&rsquo;s the climax. Helen Grimes, chaparralish as she can be, is goaded
beyond imprudence. She convinces herself that Jack Valentine is not only a falsetto, but a
financier. To lose at one fell swoop $647,000 and a lover in riding trousers with angles in the
sides like the variations on the chart of a typhoid-fever patient is enough to make any
perfect lady mad. So, then!
They stand in the (ranch) library, which is furnished with mounted elk heads (didn&rsquo;t the
Elks have a fish fry in Amagensett once?), and the d&rsquo;enouement begins. I know of no more
interesting time in the run of a play unless it be when the prologue ends.Helen thinks Jack has taken the money. Who else was there to take it? The box-office
manager was at the front on his job; the orchestra hadn&rsquo;t left their seats; and no man could
get past &ldquo;Old Jimmy,&rdquo; the stage door-man, unless he could show a Skye terrier or an
automobile as a guarantee of eligibility.
Goaded beyond imprudence (as before said), Helen says to Jack Valentine: &ldquo;Robber and
thief - and worse yet, stealer of trusting hearts, this should be your fate!&rdquo;
With that out she whips, of course, the trusty 32-caliber.
&ldquo;But I will be merciful,&rdquo; goes on Helen. &ldquo;You shall live - that will be your punishment. I
will show you how easily I could have sent you to the death that you deserve. There is her
picture on the mantel. I will send through her more beautiful face the bullet that should
have pierced your craven heart.&rdquo;
And she does it. And there&rsquo;s no fake blank cartridges or assistants pulling strings. Helen
fires. The bullet - the actual bullet - goes through the face of the photograph - and then
strikes the hidden spring of the sliding panel in the wall - and lo! the panel slides, and there
is the missing $647,000 in convincing stacks of currency and bags of gold. It&rsquo;s great. You
know how it is. Cherry practised for two months at a target on the roof of her boarding
house. It took good shooting. In the sketch she had to hit a brass disk only three inches in
diameter, covered by wall paper in the panel; and she had to stand in exactly the same spot
every night, and the photo had to be in exactly the same spot, and she had to shoot steady
and true every time.
Of course old &ldquo;Arapahoe&rdquo; had tucked the funds away there in the secret place; and, of
course, Jack hadn&rsquo;t taken anything except his salary (which really might have come under
the head of &ldquo;obtaining money under&rdquo;; but that is neither here nor there); and, of course, the
New York girl was really engaged to a concrete house contractor in the Bronx; and,
necessarily, Jack and Helen ended in a half-Nelson - and there you are.
After Hart and Cherry had gotten &ldquo;Mice Will Play&rdquo; flawless, they had a try-out at a
vaudeville house that accommodates. The sketch was a house wrecker. It was one of those
rare strokes of talent that inundates a theatre from the roof down. The gallery wept; and the
orchestra seats, being dressed for it, swam in tears.
After the show the booking agents signed blank checks and pressed fountain pens upon
Hart and Cherry. Five hundred dollars a week was what it panned out.
That night at 11:30 Bob Hart took off his hat and bade Cherry good night at her
boarding-house door.&ldquo;Mr. Hart,&rdquo; said she thoughtfully, &ldquo;come inside just a few minutes. We&rsquo;ve got our
chance now to make good and make money. What we want to do is to cut expenses every
cent we can, and save all we can.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s business with me. You&rsquo;ve got your scheme for banking yours; and
I dream every night of that bungalow with the Jap cook and nobody around to raise trouble.
Anything to enlarge the net receipts will engage my attention.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Come inside just a few minutes,&rdquo; repeated Cherry, deeply thoughtful. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
proposition to make to you that will reduce our expenses a lot and help you work out your
own future and help me work out mine - and all on business principles.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mice Will Play&rdquo; had a tremendously successful run in New York for ten weeks - rather
neat for a vaudeville sketch - and then it started on the circuits. Without following it, it may
be said that it was a solid drawing card for two years without a sign of abated popularity.
Sam Packard, manager of one of Keetor&rsquo;s New York houses, said of Hart &amp; Cherry:
&ldquo;As square and high-toned a little team as ever came over the circuit. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to
read their names on the booking list. Quiet, hard workers, no Johnny and Mabel nonsense,
on the job to the minute, straight home after their act, and each of &lsquo;em as gentlemanlike as
a lady. I don&rsquo;t expect to handle any attractions that give me less trouble or more respect for
the profession.&rdquo;
And now, after so much cracking of a nutshell, here is the kernel of the story:
At the end of its second season &ldquo;Mice Will Play&rdquo; came back to New York for another run
at the roof gardens and summer theatres. There was never any trouble in booking it at the
top-notch price. Bob Hart had his bungalow nearly paid for, and Cherry had so many
savings-deposit bank books that she had begun to buy sectional bookcases on the
instalment plan to hold them.
I tell you these things to assure you, even if you can&rsquo;t believe it, that many, very many
of the stage people are workers with abiding ambitions - just the same as the man who
wants to be president, or the grocery clerk who wants a home in Flatbush, or a lady who is
anxious to flop out of the Count-pan into the Prince-fire. And I hope I may be allowed to say,
without chipping into the contribution basket, that they often move in a mysterious way
their wonders to perform.
But, listen.
At the first performance of &ldquo;Mice Will Play&rdquo; in New York at the Westphalia (no hams
alluded to) Theatre, Winona Cherry was nervous. When she fired at the photograph of the
Eastern beauty on the mantel, the bullet, instead of penetrating the photo and then strikingthe disk, went into the lower left side of Bob Hart&rsquo;s neck. Not expecting to get it there, Hart
collapsed neatly, while Cherry fainted in a most artistic manner.
The audience, surmising that they viewed a comedy instead of a tragedy in which the
principals were married or reconciled, applauded with great enjoyment. The Cool Head, who
always graces such occasions, rang the curtain down, and two platoons of scene shifters
respectively and more or less respectfully removed Hart &amp; Cherry from the stage. The next
turn went on, and all went as merry as an alimony bell.
The stage hands found a young doctor at the stage entrance who was waiting for a
patient with a decoction of Am. B&rsquo;ty roses. The doctor examined Hart carefully and laughed
heartily.
&ldquo;No headlines for you, Old Sport,&rdquo; was his diagnosis. &ldquo;If it had been two inches to the
left it would have undermined the carotid artery as far as the Red Front Drug Store in
Flatbush and Back Again. As it is, you just get the property man to bind it up with a flounce
torn from any one of the girls&rsquo; Valenciennes and go home and get it dressed by the
parlor-floor practitioner on your block, and you&rsquo;ll be all right. Excuse me; I&rsquo;ve got a serious
case outside to look after.&rdquo;
After that, Bob Hart looked up and felt better. And then to where he lay came Vincente,
the Tramp Juggler, great in his line. Vincente, a solemn man from Brattleboro, Vt., named
Sam Griggs at home, sent toys and maple sugar home to two small daughters from every
town he played. Vincente had moved on the same circuits with Hart &amp; Cherry, and was their
peripatetic friend.
&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; said Vincente in his serious way, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s no worse. The little lady is wild
about you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Hart.
&ldquo;Cherry,&rdquo; said the juggler. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know how bad you were hurt; and we kept her
away. It&rsquo;s taking the manager and three girls to hold her.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It was an accident, of course,&rdquo; said Hart. &ldquo;Cherry&rsquo;s all right. She wasn&rsquo;t feeling in good
trim or she couldn&rsquo;t have done it. There&rsquo;s no hard feelings. She&rsquo;s strictly business. The doctor
says I&rsquo;ll be on the job again in three days. Don&rsquo;t let her worry.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; said Sam Griggs severely, puckering his old, smooth, lined face, &ldquo;are you a chess
automaton or a human pincushion? Cherry&rsquo;s crying her heart out for you - calling &lsquo;Bob, Bob,&rsquo;
every second, with them holding her hands and keeping her from coming to you.&ldquo;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rdquo; asked Hart, with wide-open eyes. &ldquo;The sketch&rsquo;ll go on
again in three days. I&rsquo;m not hurt bad, the doctor says. She won&rsquo;t lose out half a week&rsquo;s salary.
I know it was an accident. What&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You seem to be blind, or a sort of a fool,&rdquo; said Vincente. &ldquo;The girl loves you and is
almost mad about your hurt. What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Is she nothing to you? I wish you
could hear her call you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Loves me?&rdquo; asked Bob Hart, rising from the stack of scenery on which he lay. &ldquo;Cherry
loves me? Why, it&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I wish you could see her and hear her,&rdquo; said Griggs.
&ldquo;But, man,&rdquo; said Bob Hart, sitting up, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s impossible. It&rsquo;s impossible, I tell you. I never
dreamed of such a thing.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No human being,&rdquo; said the Tramp Juggler, &ldquo;could mistake it. She&rsquo;s wild for love of you.
How have you been so blind?&rdquo;
&ldquo;But, my God,&rdquo; said Bob Hart, rising to his feet, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late. It&rsquo;s too late, I tell you, Sam;
it&rsquo;s too late. It can&rsquo;t be. You must be wrong. It&rsquo;s impossible. There&rsquo;s some mistake.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s crying for you,&rdquo; said the Tramp Juggler. &ldquo;For love of you she&rsquo;s fighting three, and
calling your name so loud they don&rsquo;t dare to raise the curtain. Wake up, man.&rdquo;
&ldquo;For love of me?&rdquo; said Bob Hart with staring eyes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I tell you it&rsquo;s too late? It&rsquo;s too
late, man. Why, Cherry and I have been married two years!&rdquo;
Suite Homes and their Romance （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>FEW young couples in the Big-City-of-Bluff began their married existence with greater
promise of happiness than did Mr. and Mrs. Claude Turpin. They felt no especial animosity
toward each other; they were comfortably established in a handsome apartment house that
had a name and accommodations like those of a sleepingcar; they were living as expensively
as the couple on the next floor above who had twice their income; and their marriage had
occurred on a wager, a ferryboat and first acquaintance, thus securing a sensational
newspaper notice with their names attached to pictures of the Queen of Roumania and M.
Santos-Dumont.Turpin&rsquo;s income was $200 per month. On pay day, after calculating the amounts due for
rent, instalments on furniture and piano, gas, and bills owed to the florist, confectioner,
milliner, tailor, wine merchant and cab company, the Turpins would find that they still had
$200 left to spend. How to do this is one of the secrets of metropolitan life.
The domestic life of the Turpins was a beautiful picture to see. But you couldn&rsquo;t gaze
upon it as you could at an oleograph of &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Wake Grandma,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Brooklyn by Moonlight.&rdquo;
You had to blink when looked at it; and you heard a fizzing sound just like the machine
with a &ldquo;scope&rdquo; at the end of it. Yes; there wasn&rsquo;t much repose about the picture of the
Turpins&rsquo; domestic life. It was something like &ldquo;Spearing Salmon in the Columbia River,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Japanese Artillery in Action.&rdquo;
Every day was just like another; as the days are in New York. In the morning Turpin
would take bromoseltzer, his pocket change from under the clock, his hat, no breakfast and
his departure for the office. At noon Mrs. Turpin would get out of bed and humour, put on a
kimono, airs, and the water to boil for coffee.
Turpin lunched downtown. He came home at 6 to dress for dinner. They always dined
out. They strayed from the chop-house to chop-sueydom, from terrace to table d&rsquo;h?te, from
rathskeller to roadhouse, from café to casino, from Maria&rsquo;s to the Martha Washington. Such
is domestic life in the great city. Your vine is the mistletoe; your fig tree bears dates. Your
household gods are Mercury and John Howard Payne. For the wedding march you now hear
only &ldquo;Come with the Gypsy Bride.&rdquo; You rarely dine at the same place twice in succession. You
tire of the food; and, besides, you want to give them time for the question of that souvenir
silver sugar bowl to blow over.
The Turpins were therefore happy. They made many warm and delightful friends, some
of whom they remembered the next day. Their home life was an ideal one, according to the
rules and regulations of the Book of Bluff.
There came a time when it dawned upon Turpin that his wife was getting away with too
much money. If you belong to the near-swell class in the Big City, and your income is $200
per month, and you find at the end of the month, after looking over the bills for current
expenses, that you, yourself, have spent $150, you very naturally wonder what has become
of the other $50. So you suspect your wife. And perhaps you give her a hint that something
needs explanation.
&ldquo;I say, Vivien,&rdquo; said Turpin, one afternoon when they were enjoying in rapt silence the
peace and quiet of their cozy apartment, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been creating a hiatus big enough for a dog
to crawl through in this month&rsquo;s honorarium. You haven&rsquo;t been paying your dressmaker
anything on account, have you?&ldquo;There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. No sounds could be heard except the breathing of the
fox terrier, and the subdued, monotonous sizzling of Vivien&rsquo;s fulvous locks against the
insensate curling irons. Claude Turpin, sitting upon a pillow that he had thoughtfully placed
upon the convolutions of the apartment sofa, narrowly watched the riante, lovely face of his
wife.
&ldquo;Claudie, dear,&rdquo; said she, touching her finger to her ruby tongue and testing the
unresponsive curling irons, &ldquo;you do me an injustice. Mme. Toinette has not seen a cent of
mine since the day you paid your tailor ten dollars on account.&rdquo;
Turpin&rsquo;s suspicions were allayed for the time. But one day soon there came an
anonymous letter to him that read:
&ldquo;Watch your wife. She is blowing in your money secretly. I was a sufferer just as you are.
The place is No. 345 Blank Street. A word to the wise, etc.
&ldquo;A MAN WHO KNOWS&rdquo;
Turpin took this letter to the captain of police of the precinct that he lived in.
&ldquo;My precinct is as clean as a hound&rsquo;s tooth,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;The lid&rsquo;s shut down as
close there as it is over the eye of a Williamsburg girl when she&rsquo;s kissed at a party. But if you
think there&rsquo;s anything queer at the address, I&rsquo;ll go there with ye.&rdquo;
On the next afternoon at 3, Turpin and the captain crept softly up the stairs of No. 345
Blank Street. A dozen plain-clothes men, dressed in full police uniforms, so as to allay
suspicion, waited in the hall below.
At the top of the stairs was a door, which was found to be locked. The captain took a
key from his pocket and unlocked it. The two men entered.
They found themselves in a large room, occupied by twenty or twenty-five elegantly
clothed ladies. Racing charts hung against the walls, a ticker clicked in one corner; with a
telephone receiver to his ear a man was calling out the various positions of the horses in a
very exciting race. The occupants of the room looked up at the intruders; but, as if reassured
by the sight of the captain&rsquo;s uniform, they reverted their attention to the man at the
telephone.
&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the captain to Turpin, &ldquo;the value of an anonymous letter! No
high-minded and self-respecting gentleman should consider one worthy of notice. Is your
wife among this assembly, Mr. Turpin?&rdquo;
&ldquo;She is not,&rdquo; said Turpin.&ldquo;And if she was,&rdquo; continued the captain, &ldquo;would she be within the reach of the tongue
of slander? These ladies constitute a Browning Society. They meet to discuss the meaning of
the great poet. The telephone is connected with Boston, whence the parent society
transmits frequently its interpretations of the poems. Be ashamed of yer suspicions, Mr.
Turpin.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Go soak your shield,&rdquo; said Turpin. &ldquo;Vivien knows how to take care of herself in a
pool-room. She&rsquo;s not dropping anything on the ponies. There must be something queer
going on here.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nothing but Browning,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Hear that?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thanatopsis by a nose,&rdquo; drawled the man at the telephone.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not Browning; that&rsquo;s Longfellow,&rdquo; said Turpin, who sometimes read books.
&ldquo;Back to the pasture!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain. &ldquo;longfellow made the pacing-to-wagon
record of 7.53 &lsquo;way back in 1868.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I believe there&rsquo;s something queer about this joint,&rdquo; repeated Turpin.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; said the captain.
&ldquo;I know it looks like a pool-room, all right,&rdquo; persisted Turpin, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s all a blind.
Vivien has been dropping a lot of coin somewhere. I believe there&rsquo;s some underhanded
work going on here.&rdquo;
A number of racing sheets were tacked close together, covering a large space on one of
the walls. Turpin, suspicious, tore several of them down. A door, previously hidden, was
revealed. Turpin placed an ear to the crack and listened intently. He heard the soft hum of
many voices, low and guarded laughter, and a sharp, metallic clicking and scraping as if from
a multitude of tiny but busy objects.
&ldquo;My God! It is as I feared!&rdquo; whispered Turpin to himself. &ldquo;Summon your men at once!&rdquo;
he called to the captain. &ldquo;She is in there, I know.&rdquo;
At the blowing of the captain&rsquo;s whistle the uniformed plain-clothes men rushed up the
stairs into the poolroom. When they saw the betting paraphernalia distributed around they
halted, surprised and puzzled to know why they had been summoned.
But the captain pointed to the lock-ed door and bade them break it down. In a few
moments they demolished it with the axes they carried. Into the other room sprang Claude
Turpin, with the captain at his heels.The scene was one that lingered long in Turpin&rsquo;s mind. Nearly a score of women &ndash;
women expensively and fashionably clothed, many beautiful and of refined appearance &ndash;
had been seated at little marble-topped tables. When the police burst open the door they
shrieked and ran here and there like gayly plumed birds that had been disturbed in a tropical
grove. Some became hysterical; one or two fainted; several knelt at the feet of the officers
and besought them for mercy on account of their families and social position.
A man who had been seated behind a desk had seized a roll of currency as large as the
ankle of a Paradise Roof Gardens chorus girl and jumped out of the window. Half a dozen
attendants huddled at one end of the room, breathless from fear.
Upon the tables remained the damning and incontrovertible evidences of the guilt of
the habituées of that sinister room &ndash; dish after dish heaped high with ice cream, and
surrounded by stacks of empty ones, scraped to the last spoonful.
&ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; said the captain to his weeping circle of prisoner &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not hold any of yez.
Some of yez I recognize as having fine houses and good standing in the community, with
hard-working husbands and childer at home. But I&rsquo;ll read ye a bit of a lecture before ye go. In
the next room there&rsquo;s a 20-to-1 shot just dropped in under the wire three lengths ahead of
the field. Is this the way ye waste your husbands&rsquo; money instead of helping earn it? Home
wid yez! The lid&rsquo;s on the ice-cream freezer in this precinct.&rdquo;
Claude Turpin&rsquo;s wife was among the patrons of the raided room. He led her to their
apartment in stem silence. There she wept so remorsefully and besought his forgiveness so
pleadingly that he forgot his just anger, and soon he gathered his penitent golden-haired
Vivien in his arms and forgave her.
&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; she murmured, half sobbingly, as the moonlight drifted through the open
window, glorifying her sweet, upturned face, &ldquo;I know I done wrong. I will never touch ice
cream again. I forgot you were not a millionaire. I used to go there every day. But to-day I
felt some strange, sad presentiment of evil, and I was not myself. I ate only eleven saucers.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Say no more,&rdquo; said Claude, gently as he fondly caressed her waving curls.
&ldquo;And you are sure that you fully forgive me?&rdquo; asked Vivien, gazing at him entreatingly
with dewy eyes of heavenly blue.
&ldquo;Almost sure, little one,&rdquo; answered Claude, stooping and lightly touching her snowy
forehead with his lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know later on. I&rsquo;ve got a month&rsquo;s salary down on Vanilla to
win the three-year-old steeplechase to-morrow; and if the ice-cream hunch is to the good
you are It again &ndash; see?&ldquo;Supply and Demand （O·Henry）</p>

process, but every four days your hat needs to be cleaned again.
Finch is a leathern, sallow, slowfooted man, between twenty and forty. You would say
he had been brought up a bushelman in Essex Street. When business is slack he likes to talk,
so I had my hat cleaned even oftener than it deserved, hoping Finch might let me into some
of the secrets of the sweatshops.
One afternoon I dropped in and found Finch alone. He began to anoint my headpiece
de Panama with his mysterious fluid that attracted dust and dirt like a magnet.
&ldquo;They say the Indians weave &lsquo;em under water,&rdquo; said I, for a leader.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it,&rdquo; said Finch. &ldquo;No Indian or white man could stay under water that
long. Say, do you pay much attention to politics? I see in the paper something about a law
they&rsquo;ve passed called &lsquo;the law of supply and demand.&rsquo;&rdquo;
I explained to him as well as I could that the reference was to a politico-economical law,
and not to a legal statute.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Finch. &ldquo;I heard a good deal about it a year or so ago, but in a
one-sided way.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;political orators use it a great deal. In fact, they never give it a rest. I
suppose you heard some of those cart-tail fellows spouting on the subject over here on the
east side.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I heard it from a king,&rdquo; said Finch&ndash;&ldquo;the white king of a tribe of Indians in South
America.&rdquo;
I was interested but not surprised. The big city is like a mother&rsquo;s knee to many who
have strayed far and found the roads rough beneath their uncertain feet. At dusk they come
home and sit upon the door- step. I know a piano player in a cheap cafe who has shot lions
in Africa, a bell-boy who fought in the British army against the Zulus, an express-driver
whose left arm had been cracked like a lobster&rsquo;s claw for a stew-pot of Patagonian cannibals
when the boat of his rescuers hove in sight. So a hat-cleaner who had been a friend of a king
did not oppress me.
&ldquo;A new band ?&rdquo; asked Finch, with his dry, barren smile.&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and half an inch wider.&rdquo; I had had a new band five days before.
&ldquo;I meets a man one night,&rdquo; said Finch, beginning his story&ndash;&ldquo;a man brown as snuff, with
money in every pocket, eating schweinerknuckel in Schlagel&rsquo;s. That was two years ago, when
I was a hose-cart driver for No. 98. His discourse runs to the subject of gold. He says that
certain mountains in a country down South that he calls Gaudymala is full of it. He says the
Indians wash it out of the streams in plural quantities.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, Geronimo!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Indians! There&rsquo;s no Indians in the South,&rsquo; I tell him, &lsquo;except Elks,
Maccabees, and the buyers for the fall dry- goods trade. The Indians are all on the
reservations,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m telling you this with reservations,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;They ain&rsquo;t Buffalo Bill Indians; they&rsquo;re
squattier and more pedigreed. They call &lsquo;em Inkers and Aspics, and they was old inhabitants
when Mazuma was King of Mexico. They wash the gold out of the mountain streams,&rsquo; says
the brown man, &lsquo;and fill quills with it; and then they empty &lsquo;em into red jars till they are full;
and then they pack it in buckskin sacks of one arroba each&ndash;an arroba is twenty-five
pounds&ndash;and store it in a stone house, with an engraving of a idol with marcelled hair,
playing a flute, over the door.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;How do they work off this unearth increment?&rsquo; I asks.
&ldquo;&lsquo;They don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; says the man. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a case of &ldquo;Ill fares the land with the great deal of
velocity where wealth accumulates and there ain&rsquo;t any reciprocity.&ldquo;&rsquo;
&ldquo;After this man and me got through our conversation, which left him dry of information,
I shook hands with him and told him I was sorry I couldn&rsquo;t believe him. And a month
afterward I landed on the coast of this Gaudymala with $1,300 that I had been saving up for
five years. I thought I knew what Indians liked, and I fixed myself accordingly. I loaded down
four pack-mules with red woollen blankets, wrought-iron pails, jewelled side-combs for the
ladies, glass necklaces, and safety-razors. I hired a black mozo, who was supposed to be a
mule- driver and an interpreter too. It turned out that he could interpret mules all right, but
he drove the English language much too hard. His name sounded like a Yale key when you
push it in wrong side up, but I called him McClintock, which was close to the noise.
&ldquo;Well, this gold village was forty miles up in the mountains, and it took us nine days to
find it. But one afternoon McClintock led the other mules and myself over a rawhide bridge
stretched across a precipice five thousand feet deep, it seemed to me. The hoofs of the
beasts drummed on it just like before George M. Cohan makes his first entrance on the
stage.
&ldquo;This village was built of mud and stone, and had no streets. Some few
yellow-and-brown persons popped their heads out-of-doors, looking about like Welshrabbits with Worcester sauce on em. Out of the biggest house, that had a kind of a porch
around it, steps a big white man, red as a beet in color, dressed in fine tanned deerskin
clothes, with a gold chain around his neck, smoking a cigar. I&rsquo;ve seen United States Senators
of his style of features and build, also head-waiters and cops.
&ldquo;He walks up and takes a look at us, while McClintock disembarks and begins to
interpret to the lead mule while he smokes a cigarette.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Hello, Buttinsky,&rsquo; says the fine man to me. &lsquo;How did you get in the game? I didn&rsquo;t see
you buy any chips. Who gave you the keys of the city?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m a poor traveller,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Especially mule-back. You&rsquo;ll excuse me. Do you run a hack
line or only a bluff?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Segregate yourself from your pseudo-equine quadruped,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;and come inside.&rsquo;
&ldquo;He raises a finger, and a villager runs up.
&ldquo;&lsquo;This man will take care of your outfit,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll take care of you.&rsquo;
&ldquo;He leads me into the biggest house, and sets out the chairs and a kind of a drink the
color of milk. It was the finest room I ever saw. The stone walls was hung all over with silk
shawls, and there was red and yellow rugs on the floor, and jars of red pottery and Angora
goat skins, and enough bamboo furniture to misfurnish half a dozen seaside cottages.
&ldquo;&lsquo;In the first place,&rsquo; says the man, &lsquo;you want to know who I am. I&rsquo;m sole lessee and
proprietor of this tribe of Indians. They call me the Grand Yacuma, which is to say King or
Main Finger of the bunch. I&rsquo;ve got more power here than a charge d&rsquo;affaires, a charge of
dynamite, and a charge account at Tiffany&rsquo;s combined. In fact, I&rsquo;m the Big Stick, with as
many extra knots on it as there is on the record run of the Lusitania. Oh, I read the papers
now and then,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Now, let&rsquo;s hear your entitlements,&rsquo; he goes on, &lsquo;and the meeting
will be open.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I am known as one W. D. Finch. Occupation, capitalist. Address, 54&rsquo; East
Thirty-second&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;New York,&rsquo; chips in the Noble Grand. &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; says he, grinning. &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t the first time
you&rsquo;ve seen it go down on the blotter. I can tell by the way you hand it out. Well, explain
&ldquo;capitalist.&rdquo;&rsquo;
&ldquo;I tells this boss plain what I come for and how I come to came.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Gold-dust ?&rsquo; says he, looking as puzzled as a baby that&rsquo;s got a feather stuck on its
molasses finger. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s funny. This ain&rsquo;t a gold-mining country. And you invested all yourcapital on a stranger&rsquo;s story? Well, well! These Indians of mine&ndash;they are the last of the tribe
of Peehes&ndash;are simple as children. They know nothing of the purchasing power of gold. I&rsquo;m
afraid you&rsquo;ve been imposed on,&rsquo; says he.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Maybe so,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;but it sounded pretty straight to me.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;W. D.,&rsquo; says the King, all of a sudden, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a square deal. It ain&rsquo;t often I get to
talk to a white man, and I&rsquo;ll give you a show for your money. It may be these constituents of
mine have a few grains of gold-dust hid away in their clothes. To-morrow you may get out
these goods you&rsquo;ve brought up and see if you can make any sales. Now, I&rsquo;m going to
introduce myself unofficially. My name is Shane&ndash;Patrick Shane. I own this tribe of Peche
Indians by right of conquest&ndash;single handed and unafraid. I drifted up here four years ago,
and won &lsquo;em by my size and complexion and nerve. I learned their language in six weeks-it&rsquo;s
easy: you simply emit a string of consonants as long as your breath holds out and then point
at what you&rsquo;re asking for.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I conquered &lsquo;em, spectacularly,&rsquo; goes on King Shane, &lsquo;and then I went at &lsquo;em with
economical politics, law, sleight-of-hand, and a kind of New England ethics and parsimony.
Every Sunday, or as near as I can guess at it, I preach to &lsquo;em in the council-house (I&rsquo;m the
council) on the law of supply and demand. I praise supply and knock demand. I use the same
text every time. You wouldn&rsquo;t think, W. D.,&rsquo; says Shane, &lsquo;that I had poetry in me, would you?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know whether to call it poetry or not.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tennyson,&rsquo; says Shane, &lsquo;furnishes the poetic gospel I preach. I always considered him
the boss poet. Here&rsquo;s the way the text goes:
&ldquo;For, not to admire, if a man could learn it, were more
Than to walk all day like a Sultan of old in a garden of spice.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;You see, I teach &lsquo;em to cut out demand&ndash;that supply is the main thing. I teach &lsquo;em not
to desire anything beyond their simplest needs. A little mutton, a little cocoa, and a little
fruit brought up from the coast&ndash;that&rsquo;s all they want to make &lsquo;cm happy. I&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;em well
trained. They make their own clothes and hats out of a vegetable fibre and straw, and
they&rsquo;re a contented lot. It&rsquo;s a great thing,&rsquo; winds up Shane, &lsquo;to have made a people happy by
the incultivation of such simple institutions.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Well, the next day, with the King&rsquo;s permission, I has the McClintock open up a couple
of sacks of my goods in the little plaza of the village. The Indians swarmed around by the
hundred and looked the bargain-counter over. I shook red blankets at &lsquo;em, flashed fingerrings and ear-bobs, tried pearl necklaces and sidecombs on the women, and a line of red
hosiery on the men. &lsquo;Twas no use. They looked on like hungry graven images, but I never
made a sale. I asked McClintock what was the trouble. Mac yawned three or four times,rolled a cigarette, made one or two confidential side remarks to a mule, and then
condescended to inform me that the people had no money.
&ldquo;Just then up strolls King Patrick, big and red &lsquo;and royal as usual, with the gold chain
over his chest and his cigar in front of him.
&ldquo;&lsquo;How&rsquo;s business, W. D.?&rsquo; he asks.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Fine,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain-day rush. I&rsquo;ve got one more line of goods to offer before I
shut up shop. I&rsquo;ll try &lsquo;em with safety- razors. I&rsquo;ve&rsquo; got two gross that I bought at &lsquo;a fire sale.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Shane laughs till some kind of mameluke or private secretary he carries with him has
to hold him up.
&ldquo;&lsquo;0 my sainted Aunt Jerusha!&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;ain&rsquo;t you one of the Babes in the Goods, W. D.?
Don&rsquo;t you know that no Indians ever shave? They pull out their whiskers instead.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s just what these razors would do for &lsquo;em&ndash;they wouldn&rsquo;t have any
kick coming if they used &lsquo;em once.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Shane went away, and I could hear him laughing a block, if there had been any block.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell &lsquo;em,&rsquo; says I to McClintock, &lsquo;it ain&rsquo;t money I want&ndash;tell &lsquo;em I&rsquo;ll take gold-dust. Tell
&lsquo;em I&rsquo;ll allow &lsquo;em sixteen dollars an ounce for it in trade. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m out for&ndash;the dust.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Mac interprets, and you&rsquo;d have thought a squadron of cops had charged the crowd to
disperse it. Every uncle&rsquo;s nephew and aunt&rsquo;s niece of &lsquo;em faded away inside of two minutes.
&ldquo;At the royal palace that night me and the King talked it over.
&ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve got the dust hid out somewhere,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;or they wouldn&rsquo;t have been so
sensitive about it.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;They haven&rsquo;t,&rsquo; says Shane. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this gag you&rsquo;ve got about gold? You been reading
Edward Allen Poe? They ain&rsquo;t got any gold.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;They put it in quills,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and then they empty it in jars, and then into sacks of
twenty-five pounds each. I got it straight.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;W. D.,&rsquo; says Shane, laughing and chewing his cigar, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t often see a white man, and
I feel like putting you on. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll get away from here alive, anyhow, so I&rsquo;m going
to tell you. Come over here.&ldquo;&lsquo;He draws aside a silk fibre curtain in a corner of the room and shows me a pile of
buckskin sacks.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Forty of &lsquo;em,&rsquo; says Shane. &lsquo;One arroba in each one. In round numbers, $220,000 worth
of gold-dust you see there. It&rsquo;s all mine. It belongs to the Grand Yacuma. They bring it all to
me. Two hundred and twenty thousand dollars&ndash;think of that, you glass-bead peddler,&rsquo; says
Shane&ndash;&rsquo; and all mine.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Little good it does you,&rsquo; says I, contemptuously and hatefully. &lsquo;And so you are the
government depository of this gang of money-less money-makers? Don&rsquo;t you pay enough
interest on it to enable one of your depositors to buy an Augusta (Maine) Pullman carbon
diamond worth $200 for $4.85 ?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Listen,&rsquo; says Patrick Shane, with the sweat coming out on his brow. &lsquo; I&rsquo;m confidant
with you, as you have, somehow, enlisted my regards. Did you ever,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;feel the
avoirdupois power of gold&ndash;not the troy weight of it, but the sixteen-ounces-to-the-pound
force of it?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Never,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I never take in any bad money.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Shane drops down on the floor and throws his arms over the sacks of gold-dust.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I love it,, says he. &lsquo;I want to feel the touch of it day and night. It&rsquo;s my pleasure in life. I
come in this room, and I&rsquo;m a king and a rich man. I&rsquo;ll be a millionaire in another year. The
pile&rsquo;s getting bigger every month. I&rsquo;ve got the whole tribe washing out the sands in the
creeks. I&rsquo;m the happiest man in the world, W. D. I just want to be near this gold, and know
it&rsquo;s mine and it&rsquo;s increasing every day. Now, you know,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;why my Indians wouldn&rsquo;t
buy your goods. They can&rsquo;t. They bring all the dust to me. I&rsquo;m their king. I&rsquo;ve taught &lsquo;em not
to desire or admire. You might as well shut up shop.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you are,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a plain, contemptible miser. You preach supply
and you forget demand. Now, supply,&rsquo; I goes on, &lsquo;is never anything but supply. On the
contrary,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;demand is a much broader syllogism and assertion. Demand includes the
rights of our women and children, and charity and friendship, and even a little begging on
the street corners. They&rsquo;ve both got to harmonize equally. And I&rsquo;ve got a few things up my
commercial sleeve yet,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;that may jostle your preconceived ideas of politics and
economy.
&ldquo;The next morning I had McClintock bring tip another mule-load of goods to the plaza
and open it up. The people gathered around the same as before.
&ldquo;I got out the finest line of necklaces, bracelets, hair-combs, and earrings that I carried,
and had the women put &lsquo;em on. And then I played trumps.&ldquo;Out of my last pack I opened up a half gross of hand-mirrors, with solid tinfoil backs,
and passed &lsquo;em around among the ladies. That was the first introduction of looking-glasses
among the Peche Indians.
&ldquo;Shane walks by with his big laugh.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Business looking up any?&rsquo; he asks.
&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s looking at itself right now,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;By-and-by a kind of a murmur goes through the crowd. The women had looked into
the magic crystal and seen that they were beautiful, and was confiding the secret to the
men. The men seemed to be urging the lack of money and the hard times just before the
election, but their excuses didn&rsquo;t go.
&ldquo;Then was my time.
&ldquo;I called McClintock away from an animated conversation with his mules and told him
to do some interpreting.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell &lsquo;em,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;that gold-dust will buy for them these befitting ornaments for kings
and queens of the earth. Tell &lsquo;em the yellow sand they wash out of the waters for the High
Sanctified Yacomay and Chop Suey of the tribe will buy the precious jewels and charms that
will make them beautiful and preserve and pickle them from evil spirits. Tell &lsquo;em the
Pittsburg banks are paying four per cent. interest on deposits by mail, while this
get-rich-frequently custodian of the public funds ain&rsquo;t even paying attention. Keep telling
&lsquo;em, Mac,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;to let the gold-dust family do their work. Talk to &lsquo;em like a born
anti-Bryanite,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Remind &lsquo;em that Tom Watson&rsquo;s gone back to Georgia,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;McClintock waves his hand affectionately at one of his mules, and then hurls a few
stickfuls of minion type at the mob of shoppers.
&ldquo;A gutta-percha Indian man, with a lady hanging on his arm, with three strings of my
fish-scale jewelry and imitation marble beads around her neck, stands up on a block of stone
and makes a talk that sounds like a man shaking dice in a box to fill aces and sixes.
&ldquo;&lsquo;He says,&rsquo; says McClintock, &lsquo;that the people not know that gold-dust will buy their
things. The women very mad. The Grand Yacuma tell them it no good but for keep to make
bad spirits keep away.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t keep bad spirits away from money,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;&lsquo;They say,&rsquo; goes on McClintock, &lsquo;the Yacuma fool them. They raise plenty row.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lsquo;Going! Going!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Gold-dust or cash takes the entire stock. The dust weighed
before you, and taken at sixteen dollars the ounce&ndash; the highest price on the Gaudymala
coast.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Then the crowd disperses all of a sudden, and I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s up. Mac and me
packs away the hand-mirrors and jewelry they had handed back to us, and we had the mules
back to the corral they had set apart for our garage.
&ldquo;While we was there we hear great noises of shouting, and down across the plaza runs
Patrick Shane, hotfoot, with his clothes ripped half off, and scratches on his face like a cat
had fought him hard for every one of its lives.
&ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;re looting the treasury, W. D.,&rsquo; he sings out. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re going to kill me and you, too.
Unlimber a couple of mules at once. We&rsquo;ll have to make a get-away in a couple of minutes.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve found out,&rsquo; says I,&rsquo; the truth about the law of supply and demand.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the women, mostly,&rsquo; says the King. &lsquo;And they used to admire me so!&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;They hadn&rsquo;t seen looking-glasses then,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve got knives and hatchets,&rsquo; says Shane; &lsquo;hurry !&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Take that roan mule,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;You and your law of supply! I&rsquo;ll ride the dun, for he&rsquo;s two
knots per hour the faster. The roan has a stiff knee, but he may make it,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;If you&rsquo;d
included reciprocity in your political platform I might have given you the dun,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;Shane and McClintock and me mounted our mules and rode across the rawhide bridge
just as the Peches reached the other side and began firing stones and long knives at us. We
cut the thongs that held up our end of the bridge and headed for the coast.&rdquo;
A tall, bulky policeman came into Finch&rsquo;s shop at that moment and leaned an elbow on
the showcase. Finch nodded at him friendly.
&ldquo;I heard down at Casey&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the cop, in rumbling, husky tones, &ldquo;that there was going
to be a picnic of the Hat-Cleaners&rsquo; Union over at Bergen Beach, Sunday. Is that right?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Finch. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a dandy time.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Gimme five tickets,&rdquo; said the cop, throwing a five-dollar bill on the showcase.
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Finch, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t you going it a little too&ndash;&rdquo;&ldquo;Go to h&ndash;!&rdquo; said the cop. &ldquo;You got &lsquo;em to sell, ain&rsquo;t you? Somebody&rsquo;s got to buy &lsquo;em.
Wish I could go along.&rdquo;
I was glad to See Finch so well thought of in his neighborhood.
And then in came a wee girl of seven, with dirty face and pure blue eyes and a
smutched and insufficient dress.
&ldquo;Mamma says,&rdquo; she recited shrilly, &ldquo;that you must give me eighty cents for the grocer
and nineteen for the milkman and five cents for me to buy hokey-pokey with&ndash;but she didn&rsquo;t
say that,&rdquo; the elf concluded, with a hopeful but honest grin.
Finch shelled out the money, counting it twice, but I noticed that the total sum that the
small girl received was one dollar and four cents.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the right kind of a law,&rdquo; remarked Finch, as he carefully broke some of the
stitches of my hatband so that it would assuredly come off within a few days&ndash;&ldquo;the law of
supply and demand. But they&rsquo;ve both got to work together. I&rsquo;ll bet,&rdquo; he went on, with his dry
smile, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll get jelly beans with that nickel&ndash;she likes &lsquo;em. What&rsquo;s supply if there&rsquo;s no
demand for it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What ever became of the King?&rdquo; I asked, curiously.
&ldquo;Oh, I might have told you,&rdquo; said Finch. &ldquo;That was Shane came in and bought the tickets.
He came back with me, and he&rsquo;s on the force now.&rdquo;
A Technical Error （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>I never cared especially for feuds, believing them to be even more overrated products
of our country than grapefruit, scrapple, or honeymoons. Nevertheless, if I may be allowed, I
will tell you of an Indian Territory feud of which I was press-agent, camp-follower, and
inaccessory during the fact.
I was on a visit to Sam Durkee&rsquo;s ranch, where I had a great time falling off unmanicured
ponies and waving my bare hand at the lower jaws of wolves about two miles away. Sam
was a hardened person of about twenty- five, with a reputation for going home in the dark
with perfect equanimity, though often with reluctance.
Over in the Creek Nation was a family bearing the name of Tatum. I was told that the
Durkees and Tatums had been feuding for years. Several of each family had bitten the grass,and it was expected that more Nebuchadnezzars would follow. A younger generation of each
family was growing up, and the grass was keeping pace with them. But I gathered that they
had fought fairly; that they had not lain in cornfields and aimed at the division of their
enemies&rsquo; suspenders in the back &ndash; partly, perhaps, because there were no cornfields, and
nobody wore more than one suspender. Nor had any woman or child of either house ever
been harmed. In those days &ndash; and you will find it so yet &ndash; their women were safe.
Sam Durkee had a girl. (If it were an all-fiction magazine that I expect to sell this story to,
I should say, &ldquo;Mr. Durkee rejoiced in a fiancée.&rdquo;) Her name was Ella Baynes. They appeared
to be devoted to each other, and to have perfect confidence in each other, as all couples do
who are and have or aren&rsquo;t and haven&rsquo;t. She was tolerably pretty, with a heavy mass of
brown hair that helped her along. He introduced me to her, which seemed not to lessen her
preference for him; so I reasoned that they were surely soul-mates.
Miss Baynes lived in Kingfisher, twenty miles from the ranch. Sam lived on a gallop
between the two places.
One day there came to Kingfisher a courageous young man, rather small, with smooth
face and regular features. He made many inquiries about the business of the town, and
especially of the inhabitants cognominally. He said he was from Muscogee, and he looked it,
with his yellow shoes and crocheted four-in-hand. I met him once when I rode in for the mail.
He said his name was Beverly Travers, which seemed rather improbable.
There were active times on the ranch, just then, and Sam was too busy to go to town
often. As an incompetent and generally worthless guest, it devolved upon me to ride in for
little things such as post cards, barrels of flour, baking-powder, smoking-tobacco, and &ndash;
letters from Ella.
One day, when I was messenger for half a gross of cigarette papers and a couple of
wagon tires, I saw the alleged Beverly Travers in a yellow-wheeled buggy with Ella Baynes,
driving about town as ostentatiously as the black, waxy mud would permit. I knew that this
information would bring no balm of Gilead to Sam&rsquo;s soul, so I refrained from including it in
the news of the city that I retailed on my return. But on the next afternoon an elongated
ex-cowboy of the name of Simmons, an oldtime pal of Sam&rsquo;s, who kept a feed store in
Kingfisher, rode out to the ranch and rolled and burned many cigarettes before he would
talk. When he did make oration, his words were these:
&ldquo;Say, Sam, there&rsquo;s been a description of a galoot miscallin&rsquo; himself Bevel-edged Travels
impairing the atmospheric air of Kingfisher for the past two weeks. You know who he was?
He was not otherwise than Ben Tatum, from the Creek Nation, son of old Gopher Tatum that
your Uncle Newt shot last February. You know what he done this morning? He killed your
brother Lester &ndash; shot him in the co&rsquo;t-house yard.&ldquo;I wondered if Sam had heard. He pulled a twig from a mesquite bush, chewed it gravely,
and said:
&ldquo;He did, did he? He killed Lester?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said Simmons. &ldquo;And he did more. He run away with your girl, the same as
to say Miss Ella Baynes. I thought you might like to know, so I rode out to impart the
information.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am much obliged, Jim,&rdquo; said Sam, taking the chewed twig from his mouth. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m
glad you rode Out. Yes, I&rsquo;m right glad.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be ridin&rsquo; back, I reckon. That boy I left in the feed store don&rsquo;t know hay from
oats. He shot Lester in the back.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shot him in the back?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, while he was hitchin&rsquo; his hoss.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged, Jim.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I kind of thought you&rsquo;d like to know as soon as you could.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Come in and have some coffee before you ride back, Jim?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, no, I reckon not; I must get back to the store.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And you say &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Yes, Sam. Everybody seen &lsquo;em drive away together in a buckboard, with a big bundle,
like clothes, tied up in the back of it. He was drivin&rsquo; the team he brought over with him from
Muscogee. They&rsquo;ll be hard to overtake right away.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And which &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;I was goin&rsquo; on to tell you. They left on the Guthrie road; but there&rsquo;s no tellin&rsquo; which
forks they&rsquo;ll take &ndash; you know that.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right, Jim; much obliged.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, Sam.&rdquo;
Simmons rolled a cigarette and stabbed his pony with both heels. Twenty yards away he
reined up and called back:&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want no &ndash; assistance, as you might say?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not any, thanks.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you would. Well, so long!&rdquo;
Sam took out and opened a bone-handled pocket-knife and scraped a dried piece of
mud from his left boot. I thought at first he was going to swear a vendetta on the blade of it,
or recite &ldquo;The Gipsy&rsquo;s Curse.&rdquo; The few feuds I had ever seen or read about usually opened
that way. This one seemed to be presented with a new treatment. Thus offered on the stage,
it would have been hissed off, and one of Belasco&rsquo;s thrilling melodramas demanded instead.
&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Sam, with a profoundly thoughtful expression, &ldquo;if the cook has any cold
beans left over!&rdquo;
He called Wash, the Negro cook, and finding that he had some, ordered him to heat up
the pot and make some strong coffee. Then we went into Sam&rsquo;s private room, where he
slept, and kept his armoury, dogs, and the saddles of his favourite mounts. He took three or
four six-shooters out of a bookcase and began to look them over, whistling &ldquo;The Cowboy&rsquo;s
Lament&rdquo; abstractedly. Afterward he ordered the two best horses on the ranch saddled and
tied to the hitching-post.
Now, in the feud business, in all sections of the country, I have observed that in one
particular there is a delicate but strict etiquette belonging. You must not mention the word
or refer to the subject in the presence of a feudist. It would be more reprehensible than
commenting upon the mole on the chin of your rich aunt. I found, later on, that there is
another unwritten rule, but I think that belongs solely to the West.
It yet lacked two hours to supper-time; but in twenty minutes Sam and I were plunging
deep into the reheated beans, hot coffee, and cold beef.
Nothing like a good meal before a long ride,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Eat hearty.&rdquo;
I had a sudden suspicion.
&ldquo;Why did you have two horses saddled?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;One, two &ndash; one, two,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;You can count, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
His mathematics carried with it a momentary qualm and a lesson. The thought had not
occurred to him that the thought could possibly occur to me not to ride at his side on that
red road to revenge and justice. It was the higher calculus. I was booked for the trail. I began
to eat more beans.In an hour we set forth at a steady gallop eastward. Our horses were Kentucky-bred,
strengthened by the mesquite grass of the west. Ben Tatum&rsquo;s steeds may have been swifter,
and he had a good lead; but if he had heard the punctual thuds of the hoofs of those trailers
of ours, born in the heart of feudland, he might have felt that retribution was creeping up on
the hoof-prints of his dapper nags.
I knew that Ben Tatum&rsquo;s card to play was flight &ndash; flight until he came within the safer
territory of his own henchmen and supporters. He knew that the man pursuing him would
follow the trail to any end where it might lead.
During the ride Sam talked of the prospect for rain, of the price of beef, and of the
musical glasses. You would have thought he had never had a brother or a sweetheart or an
enemy on earth. There are some subjects too big even for the words in the &ldquo;Unabridged.&rdquo;
Knowing this phase of the feud code, but not having practised it sufficiently, I overdid the
thing by telling some slightly funny anecdotes. Sam laughed at exactly the right place &ndash;
laughed with his mouth. When I caught sight of his mouth, I wished I had been blessed with
enough sense of humour to have suppressed those anecdotes.
Our first sight of them we had in Guthrie. Tired and hungry, we stumbled, unwashed,
into a little yellow-pine hotel and sat at a table. In the opposite corner we saw the fugitives.
They were bent upon their meal, but looked around at times uneasily.
The girl was dressed in brown - one of these smooth, half-shiny, silky-looking affairs
with lace collar and cuffs, and what I believe they call an accordion-plaited skirt. She wore a
thick brown veil down to her nose, and a broad-brimmed straw hat with some kind of
feathers adorning it. The man wore plain, dark clothes, and his hair was trimmed very short.
He was such a man as you might see anywhere.
There they were &ndash; the murderer and the woman he had stolen. There we were &ndash; the
rightful avenger, according to the code, and the supernumerary who writes these words.
For one time, at least, in the heart of the supernumerary there rose the killing instinct.
For one moment he joined the force of combatants &ndash; orally.
&ldquo;What are you waiting for, Sam?&rdquo; I said in a whisper. &ldquo;Let him have it now!&rdquo;
Sam gave a melancholy sigh.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand; but he does,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He knows. Mr. Tenderfoot, there&rsquo;s a rule
out here among white men in the Nation that you can&rsquo;t shoot a man when he&rsquo;s with a
woman. I never knew it to be broke yet. You can&rsquo;t do it. You&rsquo;ve got to get him in a gang of
men or by himself. That&rsquo;s why. He knows it, too. We all know. So, that&rsquo;s Mr. Ben Tatum! Oneof the &lsquo;pretty men&rsquo;! I&rsquo;ll cut him out of the herd before they leave the hotel, and regulate his
account!&rdquo;
After supper the flying pair disappeared quickly. Although Sam haunted lobby and
stairway and halls half the night, in some mysterious way the fugitives eluded him; and in
the morning the veiled lady in the brown dress with the accordion-plaited skirt and the
dapper young man with the close-clipped hair, and the buckboard with the prancing nags,
were gone.
It is a monotonous story, that of the ride; so it shall be curtailed. Once again we
overtook them on a road. We were about fifty yards behind. They turned in the buckboard
and looked at us; then drove on without whipping up their horses. Their safety no longer lay
in speed. Ben Tatum knew. He knew that the only rock of safety left to him was the code.
There is no doubt that, had he been alone, the matter would have been settled quickly with
Sam Durkee in the usual way; but he had something at his side that kept still the
trigger-finger of both. It seemed likely that he was no coward.
So, you may perceive that woman, on occasions, may postpone instead of precipitating
conflict between man and man. But not willingly or consciously. She is oblivious of codes.
Five miles farther, we came upon the future great Western city of Chandler. The horses
of pursuers and pursued were starved and weary. There was one hotel that offered danger
to man and entertainment to beast; so the four of us met again in the dining room at the
ringing of a bell so resonant and large that it had cracked the welkin long ago. The dining
room was not as large as the one at Guthrie.
Just as we were eating apple pie &ndash; how Ben Davises and tragedy impinge upon each
other! &ndash; I noticed Sam looking with keen intentness at our quarry where they were seated at
a table across the room. The girl still wore the brown dress with lace collar and cuffs, and
the veil drawn down to her nose. The man bent over his plate, with his close cropped head
held low.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a code,&rdquo; I heard Sam say, either to me or to himself, &ldquo;that won&rsquo;t let you shoot a
man in the company of a woman; but, by thunder, there ain&rsquo;t one to keep you from killing a
woman in the company of a man!&rdquo;
And, quicker than my mind could follow his argument, he whipped a Colt&rsquo;s automatic
from under his left arm and pumped six bullets into the body that the brown dress covered
&ndash; the brown dress with the lace collar and cuffs and the accordion-plaited skirt.
The young person in the dark sack suit, from whose head and from whose life a
woman&rsquo;s glory had been clipped, laid her head on her arms stretched upon the table; whilepeople came running to raise Ben Tatum from the floor in his feminine masquerade that had
given Sam the opportunity to set aside, technically, the obligations of the code.
Telemachus, Friend （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Returning from a hunting trip, I waited at the little town of Los Pinos, in New Mexico,
for the south-bound train, which was one hour late. I sat on the porch of the Summit House
and discussed the functions of life with Telemachus Hicks, the hotel proprietor.
Perceiving that personalities were not out of order, I asked him what species of beast
had long ago twisted and mutilated his left ear. Being a hunter, I was concerned in the evils
that may befall one in the pursuit of game.
&ldquo;That ear,&rdquo; says Hicks, &ldquo;is the relic of true friendship.&rdquo;
&ldquo;An accident?&rdquo; I persisted.
&ldquo;No friendship is an accident,&rdquo; said Telemachus; and I was silent.
&ldquo;The only perfect case of true friendship I ever knew,&rdquo; went on my host, &ldquo;was a cordial
intent between a Connecticut man and a monkey. The monkey climbed palms in
Barranquilla and threw down cocoanuts to the man. The man sawed them in two and made
dippers, which he sold for two reales each and bought rum. The monkey drank the milk of
the nuts. Through each being satisfied with his own share of the graft, they lived like
brothers.
&ldquo;But in the case of human beings, friendship is a transitory art, subject to
discontinuance without further notice.
&ldquo;I had a friend once, of the entitlement of Paisley Fish, that I imagined was sealed to
me for an endless space of time. Side by side for seven years we had mined, ranched, sold
patent churns, herded sheep, took photographs and other things, built wire fences, and
picked prunes. Thinks I, neither homocide nor flattery nor riches nor sophistry nor drink can
make trouble between me and Paisley Fish. We was friends an amount you could hardly
guess at. We was friends in business, and we let our amicable qualities lap over and season
our hours of recreation and folly. We certainly had days of Damon and nights of Pythias.
&ldquo;One summer me and Paisley gallops down into these San Andres mountains for the
purpose of a month&rsquo;s surcease and levity, dressed in the natural store habiliments of man.
We hit this town of Los Pinos, which certainly was a roof-garden spot of the world, andflowing with condensed milk and honey. It had a street or two, and air, and hens, and a
eating-house; and that was enough for us.
&ldquo;We strikes the town after supper-time, and we concludes to sample whatever efficacy
there is in this eating-house down by the railroad tracks. By the time we had set down and
pried up our plates with a knife from the red oil-cloth, along intrudes Widow Jessup with the
hot biscuit and the fried liver.
&ldquo;Now, there was a woman that would have tempted an anchovy to forget his vows. She
was not so small as she was large; and a kind of welcome air seemed to mitigate her vicinity.
The pink of her face was the in hoc signo of a culinary temper and a warm disposition, and
her smile would have brought out the dogwood blossoms in December.
&ldquo;Widow Jessup talks to us a lot of garrulousness about the climate and history and
Tennyson and prunes and the scarcity of mutton, and finally wants to know where we came
from.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Spring Valley,&rsquo; says I.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Big Spring Valley,&rsquo; chips in Paisley, out of a lot of potatoes and knuckle-bone of ham in
his mouth.
&ldquo;That was the first sign I noticed that the old fidus Diogenes business between me and
Paisley Fish was ended forever. He knew how I hated a talkative person, and yet he
stampedes into the conversation with his amendments and addendums of syntax. On the
map it was Big Spring Valley; but I had heard Paisley himself call it Spring Valley a thousand
times.
&ldquo;Without saying any more, we went out after supper and set on the railroad track. We
had been pardners too long not to know what was going on in each other&rsquo;s mind.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I reckon you understand,&rsquo; says Paisley, &lsquo;that I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to accrue that
widow woman as part and parcel in and to my hereditaments forever, both domestic,
sociable, legal, and otherwise, until death us do part.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, yes,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I read it between the lines, though you only spoke one. And I
suppose you are aware,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;that I have a movement on foot that leads up to the widow&rsquo;s
changing her name to Hicks, and leaves you writing to the society column to inquire whether
the best man wears a japonica or seamless socks at the wedding!&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;ll be some hiatuses in your program,&rsquo; says Paisley, chewing up a piece of a
railroad tie. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d give in to you,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;in &lsquo;most any respect if it was secular affairs, but this
is not so. The smiles of woman,&rsquo; goes on Paisley, &lsquo;is the whirlpool of Squills and Chalybeates,
into which vortex the good ship Friendship is often drawn and dismembered. I&rsquo;d assault abear that was annoying you,&rsquo; says Paisley, &lsquo;or I&rsquo;d endorse your note, or rub the place
between your shoulder-blades with opodeldoc the same as ever; but there my sense of
etiquette ceases. In this fracas with Mrs. Jessup we play it alone. I&rsquo;ve notified you fair.&rsquo;
&ldquo;And then I collaborates with myself, and offers the following resolutions and by-laws:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Friendship between man and man,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;is an ancient historical virtue enacted in
the days when men had to protect each other against lizards with eighty-foot tails and flying
turtles. And they&rsquo;ve kept up the habit to this day, and stand by each other till the bellboy
comes up and tells them the animals are not really there. I&rsquo;ve often heard,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;about
ladies stepping in and breaking up a friendship between men. Why should that be? I&rsquo;ll tell
you, Paisley, the first sight and hot biscuit of Mrs. Jessup appears to have inserted a
oscillation into each of our bosoms. Let the best man of us have her. I&rsquo;ll play you a square
game, and won&rsquo;t do any underhanded work. I&rsquo;ll do all of my courting of her in your presence,
so you will have an equal opportunity. With that arrangement I don&rsquo;t see why our
steamboat of friendship should fall overboard in the medicinal whirlpools you speak of,
whichever of us wins out.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Good old hoss!&rsquo; says Paisley, shaking my hand. &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll do the same,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll
court the lady synonymously, and without any of the prudery and bloodshed usual to such
occasions. And we&rsquo;ll be friends still, win or lose.&rsquo;
&ldquo;At one side of Mrs. Jessup&rsquo;s eating-house was a bench under some trees where she
used to sit in the breeze after the south-bound had been fed and gone. And there me and
Paisley used to congregate after supper and make partial payments on our respects to the
lady of our choice. And we was so honorable and circuitous in our calls that if one of us got
there first we waited for the other before beginning any gallivantery.
&ldquo;The first evening that Mrs. Jessup knew about our arrangement I got to the bench
before Paisley did. Supper was just over, and Mrs. Jessup was out there with a fresh pink
dress on, and almost cool enough to handle.
&ldquo;I sat down by her and made a few specifications about the moral surface of nature as
set forth by the landscape and the contiguous perspective. That evening was surely a case in
point. The moon was attending to business in the section of sky where it belonged, and the
trees was making shadows on the ground according to science and nature, and there was a
kind of conspicuous hullabaloo going on in the bushes between the bullbats and the orioles
and the jack-rabbits and other feathered insects of the forest. And the wind out of the
mountains was singing like a Jew&rsquo;s-harp in the pile of old tomato-cans by the railroad track.
&ldquo;I felt a kind of sensation in my left side&ndash;something like dough rising in a crock by the
fire. Mrs. Jessup had moved up closer.&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, Mr. Hicks,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;when one is alone in the world, don&rsquo;t they feel it more
aggravated on a beautiful night like this?&rsquo;
&ldquo;I rose up off the bench at once.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Excuse me, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll have to wait till Paisley comes before I can give a
audible hearing to leading questions like that.&rsquo;
&ldquo;And then I explained to her how we was friends cinctured by years of embarrassment
and travel and complicity, and how we had agreed to take no advantage of each other in any
of the more mushy walks of life, such as might be fomented by sentiment and proximity. Mrs.
Jessup appears to think serious about the matter for a minute, and then she breaks into a
species of laughter that makes the wildwood resound.
&ldquo;In a few minutes Paisley drops around, with oil of bergamot on his hair, and sits on the
other side of Mrs. Jessup, and inaugurates a sad tale of adventure in which him and Pieface
Lumley has a skinning-match of dead cows in &lsquo;95 for a silver-mounted saddle in the Santa
Rita valley during the nine months&rsquo; drought.
&ldquo;Now, from the start of that courtship I had Paisley Fish hobbled and tied to a post.
Each one of us had a different system of reaching out for the easy places in the female heart.
Paisley&rsquo;s scheme was to petrify &lsquo;em with wonderful relations of events that he had either
come across personally or in large print. I think he must have got his idea of subjugation
from one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s shows I see once called &lsquo;Othello.&rsquo; There is a coloured man in it
who acquires a duke&rsquo;s daughter by disbursing to her a mixture of the talk turned out by
Rider Haggard, Lew Dockstader, and Dr. Parkhurst. But that style of courting don&rsquo;t work well
off the stage.
&ldquo;Now, I give you my own recipe for inveigling a woman into that state of affairs when
she can be referred to as &lsquo;nee Jones.&rsquo; Learn how to pick up her hand and hold it, and she&rsquo;s
yours. It ain&rsquo;t so easy. Some men grab at it so much like they was going to set a dislocation of
the shoulder that you can smell the arnica and hear &lsquo;em tearing off bandages. Some take it
up like a hot horseshoe, and hold it off at arm&rsquo;s length like a druggist pouring tincture of
asafoetida in a bottle. And most of &lsquo;em catch hold of it and drag it right out before the lady&rsquo;s
eyes like a boy finding a baseball in the grass, without giving her a chance to forget that the
hand is growing on the end of her arm. Them ways are all wrong.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the right way. Did you ever see a man sneak out in the back yard and pick
up a rock to throw at a tomcat that was sitting on a fence looking at him? He pretends he
hasn&rsquo;t got a thing in his hand, and that the cat don&rsquo;t see him, and that he don&rsquo;t see the cat.
That&rsquo;s the idea. Never drag her hand out where she&rsquo;ll have to take notice of it. Don&rsquo;t let her
know that you think she knows you have the least idea she is aware you are holding her
hand. That was my rule of tactics; and as far as Paisley&rsquo;s serenade about hostilities andmisadventure went, he might as well have been reading to her a time- table of the Sunday
trains that stop at Ocean Grove, New Jersey.
&ldquo;One night when I beat Paisley to the bench by one pipeful, my friendship gets
subsidised for a minute, and I asks Mrs. Jessup if she didn&rsquo;t think a &lsquo;H&rsquo; was easier to write
than a &lsquo;J.&rsquo; In a second her head was mashing the oleander flower in my button-hole, and I
leaned over and&ndash;but I didn&rsquo;t.
&ldquo;&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; says I, standing up, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll wait for Paisley to come before finishing
this. I&rsquo;ve never done anything dishonourable yet to our friendship, and this won&rsquo;t be quite
fair.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Hicks,&rsquo; says Mrs. Jessup, looking at me peculiar in the dark, &lsquo;if it wasn&rsquo;t for but one
thing, I&rsquo;d ask you to hike yourself down the gulch and never disresume your visits to my
house.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;And what is that, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; I asks.
&ldquo;&lsquo;You are too good a friend not to make a good husband,&rsquo; says she.
&ldquo;In five minutes Paisley was on his side of Mrs. Jessup.
&ldquo;&lsquo;In Silver City, in the summer of &lsquo;98,&rsquo; he begins, &lsquo;I see Jim Batholomew chew off a
Chinaman&rsquo;s ear in the Blue Light Saloon on account of a crossbarred muslin shirt that&ndash;what
was that noise?&rsquo;
&ldquo;I had resumed matters again with Mrs. Jessup right where we had left off.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mrs. Jessup,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;has promised to make it Hicks. And this is another of the same
sort.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Paisley winds his feet round a leg of the bench and kind of groans.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Lem,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;we been friends for seven years. Would you mind not kissing Mrs.
Jessup quite so loud? I&rsquo;d do the same for you.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;The other kind will do as well.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;This Chinaman,&rsquo; goes on Paisley, &lsquo;was the one that shot a man named Mullins in the
spring of &lsquo;97, and that was&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;Paisley interrupted himself again.&rdquo;&lsquo;Lem,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;if you was a true friend you wouldn&rsquo;t hug Mrs. Jessup quite so hard. I
felt the bench shake all over just then. You know you told me you would give me an even
chance as long as there was any.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Man,&rsquo; says Mrs. Jessup, turning around to Paisley, &lsquo;if you was to drop in to the
celebration of mine and Mr. Hicks&rsquo;s silver wedding, twenty-five years from now, do you think
you could get it into that Hubbard squash you call your head that you are nix cum rous in
this business? I&rsquo;ve put up with you a long time because you was Mr. Hicks&rsquo;s friend; but it
seems to me it&rsquo;s time for you to wear the willow and trot off down the hill.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mrs. Jessup,&rsquo; says I, without losing my grasp on the situation as fiance, &lsquo;Mr. Paisley is
my friend, and I offered him a square deal and a equal opportunity as long as there was a
chance.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;A chance!&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;Well, he may think he has a chance; but I hope he won&rsquo;t think
he&rsquo;s got a cinch, after what he&rsquo;s been next to all the evening.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Well, a month afterwards me and Mrs. Jessup was married in the Los Pinos Methodist
Church; and the whole town closed up to see the performance.
&ldquo;When we lined up in front and the preacher was beginning to sing out his rituals and
observances, I looks around and misses Paisley. I calls time on the preacher. &lsquo;Paisley ain&rsquo;t
here,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got to wait for Paisley. A friend once, a friend always&ndash;that&rsquo;s Telemachus
Hicks,&rsquo; says I. Mrs. Jessup&rsquo;s eyes snapped some; but the preacher holds up the incantations
according to instructions.
&ldquo;In a few minutes Paisley gallops up the aisle, putting on a cuff as he comes. He explains
that the only dry-goods store in town was closed for the wedding, and he couldn&rsquo;t get the
kind of a boiled shirt that his taste called for until he had broke open the back window of the
store and helped himself. Then he ranges up on the other side of the bride, and the wedding
goes on. I always imagined that Paisley calculated as a last chance that the preacher might
marry him to the widow by mistake.
&ldquo;After the proceedings was over we had tea and jerked antelope and canned apricots,
and then the populace hiked itself away. Last of all Paisley shook me by the hand and told
me I&rsquo;d acted square and on the level with him and he was proud to call me a friend.
&ldquo;The preacher had a small house on the side of the street that he&rsquo;d fixed up to rent;
and he allowed me and Mrs. Hicks to occupy it till the ten-forty train the next morning,
when we was going on a bridal tour to El Paso. His wife had decorated it all up with
hollyhocks and poison ivy, and it looked real festal and bowery.
&ldquo;About ten o&rsquo;clock that night I sets down in the front door and pulls off my boots a
while in the cool breeze, while Mrs. Hicks was fixing around in the room. Right soon the lightwent out inside; and I sat there a while reverberating over old times and scenes. And then I
heard Mrs. Hicks call out, &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t you coming in soon, Lem?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; says I, kind of rousing up. &lsquo;Durn me if I wasn&rsquo;t waiting for old Paisley to&ndash;&rsquo;
&ldquo;But when I got that far,&rdquo; concluded Telemachus Hicks, &ldquo;I thought somebody had shot
this left ear of mine off with a forty-five. But it turned out to be only a lick from a
broomhandle in the hands of Mrs. Hicks.&rdquo;
The Theory and the Hound （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>NOT many days ago my old friend from the tropics, J. P. Bridger, United States consul on
the island of Ratona, was in the city. We had wassail and jubilee and saw the Flatiron
building, and missed seeing the Bronxless menagerie by about a couple of nights. And then,
at the ebb tide, we were walking up a street that parallels and parodies Broadway.
A woman with a comely and mundane countenance passed us, holding in leash a
wheezing, vicious, waddling, brute of a yellow pug. The dog entangled himself with Bridger&rsquo;s
legs and mumbled his ankles in a snarling, peevish, sulky bite. Bridger, with a happy smile,
kicked the breath out of the brute; the woman showered us with a quick rain of
well-conceived adjectives that left us in no doubt as to our place in her opinion, and we
passed on. Ten yards farther an old woman with dis- ordered white hair and her bankbook
tucked well hidden beneath her tattered shawl begged. Bridger stopped and disinterred for
her a quarter from his holiday waist- coat.
On the next corner a quarter of a ton of well-clothed man with a rice-powdered, fat,
white jowl, stood holding the chain of a devil-born bulldog whose forelegs were strangers by
the length of a dachshund. A little woman in a last-season&rsquo;s hat confronted him and wept,
which was plainly all she could do, while he cursed her in low sweet, practised tones.
Bridger smiled again &ndash; strictly to himself &ndash; and this time he took out a little
memorandum book and made a note of it. This he had no right to do without due
explanation, and I said so.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new theory,&rdquo; said Bridger, &ldquo;that I picked up down in Ratona. I&rsquo;ve been gathering
support for it as I knock about. The world isn&rsquo;t ripe for it yet, but &ndash; well I&rsquo;ll tell you; and then
you run your mind back along the people you&rsquo;ve known and see what you make of it.&rdquo;
And so I cornered Bridger in a place where they have artificial palms and wine; and he
told me the story which is here in my words and on his responsibility.One afternoon at three o&rsquo;clock, on the island of Ratona, a boy raced alongthe beach
screaming, &ldquo;Pajaro, ahoy!&rdquo;
Thus he made known the keenness of his hearing and the justice of his discrimination in
pitch.
He who first heard and made oral proclamation con- cerning the toot of an approaching
steamer&rsquo;s whistle, and correctly named the steamer, was a small hero in Ratona -until the&rsquo;
next steamer came. Wherefore, there was rivalry among the barefoot youth of Ratona, and
many fell victims to the softly blown conch shells of sloops which, as they enter harbour,
sound surprisingly like a distant steamer&rsquo;s signal. And some could name you the vessel when
its call, in your duller ears, sounded no louder than the sigh of the wind through the
branches of the cocoa- nut palms.
But to-day he who proclaimed the Pajaro gained his honours. Ratona bent its ear to
listen; and soon the deep-tongued blast grew louder and nearer, and at length Ratona saw
above the line of palms on the low &ldquo;joint&rdquo; the two black funnels of the fruiter slowly
creeping toward the mouth of the harbour.
You must know that Ratona is an island twenty miles off the south of a South American
republic. It is a port of that republic; and it sleeps sweetly in a smiling sea, toiling not nor
spinning; fed by the abundant tropics where all things &ldquo;ripen, cease and fall toward the
grave.&rdquo;
Eight hundred people dream life away in a green- embowered village that follows the
horseshoe curve of its bijou harbour. They are mostly Spanish and Indian mestizos, with a
shading of San Domingo Negroes, a lightening of pure-blood Spanish officials and a slight
leavening of the froth of three or four pioneering white races. No steamers touch at Ratona
save the fruit steamers which take on their banana inspectors there on their way to the
coast. They leave Sunday newspapers, ice, quinine, bacon, watermelons and vaccine matter
at the island and that is about all the touch Ratona gets with the world.
The Pajaro paused at the mouth of the harbour, roll ing heavily in the swell that sent
the whitecaps racing beyond the smooth water inside. Already two dories from the village &ndash;
one conveying fruit inspectors, the other going for what it could get &ndash; were halfway out to
the steamer.
The inspectors&rsquo; dory was taken on board with them, and the Pajaro steamed away for
the mainland for its load of fruit.
The other boat returned to Ratona bearing a contri- bution from the Pajaro&rsquo;s store of
ice, the usual roll of newspapers and one passenger &ndash; Taylor Plunkett, sheriff of Chatham
County, Kentucky.Bridger, the United States consul at Ratona, was clean- ing his rifle in the official shanty
under a bread-fruit tree twenty yards from the water of the harbour. The consul occupied a
place somewhat near the tail of his political party&rsquo;s procession. The music of the band
wagon sounded very faintly to him in the distance. The plums of office went to others.
Bridger&rsquo;s share of the spoils &ndash; the consulship at Ratona &ndash; was little more than a prune &ndash; a
dried prune from the boarding-house department of the public crib. But $900 yearly was
opulence in Ratona. Besides, Bridger had contracted a passion for shooting alligators in the
lagoons near his consulate, and was not unhappy.
He looked up from a careful inspection of his rifle lock a broad man filling his doorway.
A broad, noiseless, slow-moving man, sunburned almost to the Vandyke. A man of forty-five,
neatly clothed in homespun, with scanty light hair, a close-clipped brown- and-gray beard
and pale-blue eyes expressing mildness implicity.
&ldquo;You are Mr. Bridger, the consul,&rdquo; said the broad man. &ldquo;They directed me here. Can you
tell me what those big bunches of things like gourds are in those trees that look like feather
dusters along the edge of the water?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Take that chair,&rdquo; said the consul, reoiling his clean- ing rag. &ldquo;No, the other one &ndash; that
bamboo thing won&rsquo;t hold you. Why, they&rsquo;re cocoanuts &ndash; green cocoanuts. The shell of &lsquo;em is
always a light green before they&rsquo;re ripe.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Much obliged,&rdquo; said the other man, sitting down carefully. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite like to tell the
folks at home they were olives unless I was sure about it. My name is Plunkett. I&rsquo;m sheriff of
Chatham County, Kentucky. I&rsquo;ve got extradition papers in my pocket authorizing the arrest of
a man on this island. They&rsquo;ve been signed by the President of this country, and they&rsquo;re in
correct shape. The man&rsquo;s name is Wade Williams. He&rsquo;s in the cocoa- nut raising business.
What he&rsquo;s wanted for is the murder of his wife two years ago. Where can I find him?&rdquo;
The consul squinted an eye and looked through his rifle barrel.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody on the island who calls himself &lsquo;Wil- liams,&rsquo;&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t suppose there was,&rdquo; said Plunkett mildly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do by any other name.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Besides myself,&rdquo; said Bridger, &ldquo;there are only two Americans on Ratona &ndash; Bob Reeves
and Henry Morgan.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The man I want sells cocoanuts,&rdquo; suggested Plunkett.
&ldquo;You see that cocoanut walk extending up to the point?&rdquo; said the consul, waving his
hand toward the open door. &ldquo;That belongs to Bob Reeves. Henry Morgan owns half the trees
to loo&rsquo;ard on the island.&ldquo;&ldquo;One, month ago,&rdquo; said the sheriff, &ldquo;Wade Williams wrote a confidential letter to a man
in Chatham county, telling him where he was and how he was getting along. The letter was
lost; and the person that found it gave it away. They sent me after him, and I&rsquo;ve got the
papers. I reckon he&rsquo;s one of your cocoanut men for certain.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got his picture, of course,&rdquo; said Bridger. &ldquo;It might be Reeves or Morgan, but I&rsquo;d
hate to think it. They&rsquo;re both as fine fellows as you&rsquo;d meet in an all-day auto ride.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; doubtfully answered Plunkett; &ldquo;there wasn&rsquo;t any picture of Williams to be had.
And I never saw him myself. I&rsquo;ve been sheriff only a year. But I&rsquo;ve got a pretty accurate
description of him. About 5 feet 11; dark-hair and eyes; nose inclined to be Roman; heavy
about the shoulders; strong, white teeth, with none miss- ing; laughs a good deal, talkative;
drinks considerably but never to intoxication; looks you square in the eye when talking; age
thirty-five. Which one of your men does that description fit?&rdquo;
The consul grinned broadly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you do,&rdquo; he said, laying down his rifle and slipping on his dingy black
alpaca coat. &ldquo;You come along, Mr. Plunkett, &ndash; and I&rsquo;ll take you up to see the boys. If you can
tell which one of &lsquo;em your descrip- tion fits better than it does the other you have the
advan- tage of me.&rdquo;
Bridger conducted the sheriff out and along the hard beach close to which the tiny
houses of the village were distributed. Immediately back of the town rose sudden, small,
thickly wooded hills. Up one of these, by means of steps cut in the hard clay, the consul led
Plunkett. the very verge of an eminence was perched, a two- room wooden cottage with a
thatched roof. A Carib woman was washing clothes outside. The consul ushered the sheriff
to the door of the room that over- looked the harbour.
Two men were in the room, about to sit down, in their shirt sleeves, to a table spread
for dinner. They bore little resemblance one to the other in detail; but the general
description given by Plunkett could have been justly applied to either. In height, colour of
hair, shape of nose, build and manners each of them tallied with it. They were fair types of
jovial, ready-witted, broad- gauged Americans who had gravitated together for companionship in an alien land.
&ldquo;Hello, Bridger&rdquo; they called in unison at sight Of the consul. &ldquo;Come and have dinner
with us!&rdquo; And then they noticed Plunkett at his heels, and came forward with hospitable
curiosity.
&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the consul, his voice taking on unaccustomed formality, &ldquo;this is Mr.
Plunkett. Mr. Plunkett &ndash; Mr. Reeves and Mr. Morgan.&ldquo;The cocoanut barons greeted the newcomer joyously. Reeves seemed about an inch
taller than Morgan, but his laugh was not quite as loud. Morgan&rsquo;s eyes were- deep brown;
Reeves&rsquo;s were black. Reeves was the host and busied himself with fetching other chairs and
calling to the Carib woman for supplemental table ware. It was explained that Morgan lived
in a bamboo shack to. loo&rsquo;ard, but that every day the two friends dined together. Plunkett
stood still during the preparations, looking about mildly with his pale-blue eyes. Bridger
looked apologetic and uneasy.
At length two other covers were laid and the company- was assigned to places. Reeves
and Morgan stood side by side across the table from the visitors. Reeves nodded genially as
a signal for all to seat themselves. And then suddenly Plunkett raised his hand with a gesture
of authority. He was looking straight between Reeves and Morgan.
&ldquo;Wade Williams,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;you are under arrest for murder.&rdquo;
Reeves and Morgan instantly exchanged a quick, bright glance, the quality of which was
interrogation, with a seasoning of surprise. Then, simultaneously they turned to the speaker
with a puzzled and frank depre- cation in their gaze.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say that we understand you, Mr. Plunkett,&rdquo; said Morgan, cheerfully. &ldquo;Did you say
&lsquo;Williams&rsquo;?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the joke, Bridgy?&rdquo; asked Reeves, turning, to the consul with a smile.
Before Bridger could answer Plunkett spoke again.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;One of you don&rsquo;t need any explanation, but this is for the
other one. One of you is Wade Williams of Chatham County, Kentucky. You murdered your
wife on May 5, two years ago, after ill-treating and abusing her continually for five years. I
have the proper papers in my pocket for taking you back with me, and you are going. We will
return on the fruit steamer that comes back by this island to-morrow to leave its inspectors.
I acknowledge, gentlemen, that I&rsquo;m not quite sure which one of you is Williams. But Wade
Williams goes back to Chatham County to-morrow. I want you to understand that.&rdquo;
A great sound of merry laughter from Morgan and Reeves went out over the still
harbour. Two or three fishermen in the fleet of sloops anchored there looked up at the
house of the diablos Americanos on the hill and wondered.
&ldquo;My dear Mr. Plunkett,&rdquo; cried Morgan, conquering his mirth, &ldquo;the dinner is getting, cold.
Let us sit down and eat. I am anxious to get my spoon into that shark- fin soup. Business
afterward.&ldquo;&ldquo;Sit down, gentlemen, if you please,&rdquo; added Reeves, pleasantly. &ldquo;I am sure Mr. Plunkett
will not object. Perhaps a little time may be of advantage to him in identi- fying &ndash; the
gentlemen he wishes to arrest.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No objections, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Plunkett, dropping into his chair heavily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry
myself. I didn&rsquo;t want to accept the hospitality of you folks without giving you notice; that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;
Reeves set bottles and glasses on the table.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s cognac,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and anisada, and Scotch &lsquo;smoke,&rsquo; and rye. Take your choice.&rdquo;
Bridger chose rye, Reeves poured three fingers of Scotch for himself, Morgan took the
same. The sheriff, against much protestation, filled his glass from the water bottle.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the appetite,&rdquo; said Reeves, raising his glass, &ldquo;of Mr. Williams!&rdquo; Morgan&rsquo;s
laugh and his drink encountering sent him into a choking splutter. All began to pay attention
to the dinner, which was well cooked and palatable.
&ldquo;Williams!&rdquo; called Plunkett, suddenly and sharply.
All looked up wonderingly. Reeves found the sheriff&rsquo;s mild eye resting upon him. He
flushed a little.
&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said, with some asperity, &ldquo;my name&rsquo;s Reeves,and I don&rsquo;t want you too &ndash;
&ldquo; But the comedy of the thing came to his rescue, and he ended with a laugh.
&ldquo;I suppose, Mr. Plunkett,&rdquo; said Morgan, carefully seasoning an alligator pear, &ldquo;that you
are aware of the fact that you will import a good deal of trouble for your- self into Kentucky
if you take back the wrong man &ndash; that is, of course, if you take anybody back?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thank you for the salt,&rdquo; said the sheriff. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll take somebody back. It&rsquo;ll be one of
you two gentlemen. Yes, I know I&rsquo;d get stuck for damages if I make a mis- take. But I&rsquo;m going
to try to get the right man.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you do,&rdquo; said Morgan, leaning for- ward with a jolly twinkle in his eyes.
&ldquo;You take me. I&rsquo;ll go without any trouble. The cocoanut business hasn&rsquo;t panned out well this
year, and I&rsquo;d like to make some extra money out of your bondsmen.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo; chimed in Reeves. &ldquo;I got only $16 a thousand for my last shipment.
Take me, Mr. Plunkett.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take Wade Williams,&rdquo; said the sheriff, patiently, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll come pretty close to it.&rdquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like dining with a ghost,&rdquo; remarked Morgan, with a pretended shiver. &ldquo;The ghost of
a murderer, too! Will somebody pass the toothpicks to the shade of the naughty Mr.
Williams?&rdquo;
Plunkett seemed as unconcerned as if he were dining at his own table in Chatham
County. He was a gallant trencherman, and the strange tropic viands tickled his palate. Heavy,
commonplace, almost slothful in his movements, he appeared to be devoid of all the
cunning and watchfulness of the sleuth. He even ceased to observe, with any sharpness or
attempted discrimination, the two men, one of whom he had undertaken with sur- prising
self-confidence, to drag away upon the serious charge of wife-murder. Here, indeed, was a
problem set before him that if wrongly solved would have amounted to his serious
discomfiture, yet there he sat puzzling his soul (to all appearances) over the novel flavour of
a broiled iguana cutlet.
The consul felt a decided discomfort. Reeves and Morgan were his friends and pals; yet
the sheriff from Kentucky had a certain right to his official aid and moral support. So Bridger
sat the silentest around the board and tried to estimate the peculiar situation. His conclusion was that both Reeves and Morgan, quickwitted, as he knew them to be, had
conceived at the moment of Plunkett&rsquo;s disclosure of his mission &ndash; and in the brief space of a
lightning flash &ndash; the idea that the other might be the guilty Williams; and that each of them
had decided in that moment loyally to protect his comrade against the doom that
threatened him. This was the consul&rsquo;s theory. and if he had been a bookmaker at a race of
wits for life and liberty he would have offered heavy odds against the plodding sheriff from
Chatham County, Kentucky.
When the meal was concluded the Carib woman came and removed the dishes and
cloth. Reeves strewed them table with excellent cigars, and Plunkett, with the others, lighted
one of these with evident gratification.
&ldquo;I may be dull,&rdquo; said Morgan, with a grin and a wink at Bridger; &ldquo;but I want to know if I
am. Now, I say this is all a joke of Mr. Plunkett&rsquo;s, concocted to frighten. two
babes-in-the-woods. Is this Williamson to be taken seriously or not?&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Williams,&rsquo;&rdquo; corrected Plunkett gravely. &ldquo;I never got off any jokes in my life. I know I
wouldn&rsquo;t travel 2,000 miles to get off a poor one as this would be if I didn&rsquo;t take Wade
Williams back with me. Gentlemen!&rdquo; continued the sheriff, now letting his mild eyes travel
impartially from one of the company to another, &ldquo;see if you can find any joke in this case.
Wade Williams is listening to the words I utter now; but out of politeness, I will speak of him
as a third person. For five years he made his wife lead the life of a dog &ndash; No; I&rsquo;ll take that
back. No dog in Kentucky was ever treated as she was. He spent the money that she brought
him &ndash; spent it at races, at the card table and on horses and hunting. He was a good fellow to
his friends, but a cold, sullen demon at home. He wound up the five years of neglect by striking her with his closed hand &ndash; a hand as hard as a stone &ndash; when she was ill and weak from
suffering. She died the next day; and he skipped. That&rsquo;s all there is to it. It&rsquo;s enough. I neversaw Williams; but I knew his wife. I&rsquo;m not a man to tell half. She and I were keep- ing
company when she met him. She went to Louisville on a visit and saw him there. I&rsquo;ll admit
that he spoilt my chances in no time. I lived then on the edge of the Cumberland mountains.
I was elected sheriff of Chatham County a year after Wade Williams killed his wife. My
official duty sends me out here after him; but I&rsquo;ll admit that there&rsquo;s personal feeling, too.
And he&rsquo;s going back with me. Mr. &ndash; er &ndash; Reeves, will you pass me a match?
&ldquo;Awfully imprudent of Williams,&rdquo; said Morgan, putting his feet up against the wall, &ldquo;to
strike a Kentucky lady. Seems to me I&rsquo;ve heard they were scrappers.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bad, bad Williams,&rdquo; said Reeves, pouring out more Scotch.&rdquo;
The two men spoke lightly, but the consul saw and felt the tension and the carefulness
in their actions and words. &ldquo;Good old fellows,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re both all right.
Each of &lsquo;em is standing by the other like a little brick church.&rdquo;
And then a dog walked into the room where they sat &ndash; a black-and-tan hound,
long-eared, lazy, confident of welcome.
Plunkett turned his head and looked at the animal, which halted, confidently, within a
few feet of his chair.
Suddenly the sheriff, with a deep-mouthed oath, left his seat and, bestowed upon the
dog a vicious and heavy kick, with his ponderous shoe.
The hound, heartbroken, astonished, with flapping ears and incurved tail, uttered a
piercing yelp of pain and surprise.
Reeves and the consul remained in their chairs, say- ing nothing, but astonished at the
unexpected show of intolerance from the easy-going-man from Chatham county.
But Morgan, with a suddenly purpling face, leaped, to his feet and raised a threatening
arm above the guest.
&ldquo;You &ndash; brute!&rdquo; he shouted, passionately; &ldquo;why did you do that?&rdquo;
Quickly the amenities returned, Plunkett muttered some indistinct apology and
regained his seat. Morgan with a decided effort controlled his indignation and also returned
to his chair.
And then Plunkett with the spring of a tiger, leaped around the corner of the table and
snapped handcuffs on the paralyzed Morgan&rsquo;s wrists.
&ldquo;Hound-lover and woman-killer!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;get ready to meet your God.&ldquo;When Bridger had finished I asked him:
&ldquo;Did he get the right man?&rdquo;
&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; said the Consul.
&ldquo;And how did he know?&rdquo; I inquired, being in a kind of bewilderment.
&ldquo;When he put Morgan in the dory,&rdquo; answered Bridger, &ldquo;the next day to take him aboard
the Pajaro, this man Plunkett stopped to shake hands with me and I asked him the same
question.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Bridger,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a Kentuckian, and I&rsquo;ve seen a great deal of both men and
animals. And I never yet saw a man that was overfond of horses and dogs but what was
cruel to women.&lsquo;&rdquo;
Thimble, Thimble （O·Henry）</p>

<p>These are the directions for finding the I office of Carteret &amp; Carteret, Mill Supplies and
Leather Belting:
You follow the Broadway trail down until you pass the Crosstown Line, the Bread Line,
and the Dead Line, and come to the Big Canons of the Moneygrubber Tribe. Then you turn
to the left, to the right, dodge a push-cart and the tongue of a two-ton, four-horse dray and
hop, skip, and jump to a granite ledge on the side of a twenty-one-story synthetic mountain
of stone and iron. In the twelfth story is the office of Carteret &amp; Carteret. The factory where
they make the mill supplies and leather belting is in Brooklyn. Those commodities&ndash;to say
nothing of Brooklyn&ndash;not being of interest to you, let us hold the incidents within the
confines of a one-act, one-scene play, thereby lessening the toil of the reader and the
expenditure of the publisher. So, if you have the courage to face four pages of type and
Carteret &amp; Carteret&rsquo;s office boy, Percival, you shall sit on a varnished chair in the inner office
and peep at the little comedy of the Old Nigger Man, the Hunting-Case Watch, and the
Open-Faced Question&ndash;mostly borrowed from the late Mr. Frank Stockton, as you will
conclude.
First, biography (but pared to the quick) must intervene. I am for the inverted
sugar-coated quinine pill&ndash;the bitter on the outside.The Carterets were, or was (Columbia College professors please rule), an old Virginia
family. Long time ago the gentlemen of the family had worn lace ruffles and carried tinless
foils and owned plantations and had slaves to burn. But the war had greatly reduced their
holdings. (Of course you can perceive at once that this flavor has been shoplifted from Mr. F.
Hopkinson Smith, in spite of the &ldquo;et&rdquo; after &ldquo;Carter.&rdquo;) Well, anyhow:
In digging up the Carteret history I shall not take you farther back than the year 1620.
The two original American Carterets came over in that year, but by different means of
transportation. One brother, named John, came in the Mayflower and became a Pilgrim
Father. You&rsquo;ve seen his picture on the covers of the Thanksgiving magazines, hunting turkeys
in the deep snow with a blunderbuss. Blandford Carteret, the other brother, crossed the
pond in his own brigantine, landed on the Virginia coast, and became an F.F.V. John became
distinguished for piety and shrewdness in business; Blandford for his pride, juleps;
marksmanship, and vast slave-cultivated plantations.
Then came the Civil War. (I must condense this historical interpolation.) Stonewall
Jackson was shot; Lee surrendered; Grant toured the world; cotton went to nine cents; Old
Crow whiskey and Jim Crow cars were invented; the Seventy-ninth Massachusetts
Volunteers returned to the Ninety-seventh Alabama Zouaves the battle flag of Lundy&rsquo;s Lane
which they bought at a second-hand store in Chelsea kept by a man named Skzchnzski;
Georgia sent the President a sixty-pound watermelon&ndash;and that brings us up to the time
when the story begins. My! but that was sparring for an opening! I really must brush op on
my Aristotle.
The Yankee Carterets went into business in New York long before the war. Their house,
as far as Leather Belting and Mill Supplies was concerned, was as musty and arrogant and
solid as one of those old East India tea-importing concerns that you read about in Dickens.
There were some rumors of a war behind its counters, but not enough to affect the
business.
During and after the war, Blandford Carteret, F.F.V., lost his plantations, juleps,
marksmanship, and life. He bequeathed little more than his pride to his surviving family. So
it came to pass that Blandford Carteret, the Fifth, aged fifteen, was invited by the
leather-and-millsupplies branch of that name to come North and learn business instead of
hunting foxes and boasting of the glory of his fathers on the reduced acres of his
impoverished family. The boy jumped at the chance; and, at the age of twenty-five, sat in
the office of the firm equal partner with John, the Fifth, of the blunderbuss-and-turkey
branch. Here the story begins again.
The young men were about the same age, smooth of face, alert, easy of manner, and
with an air that promised mental and physical quickness. They were razored, blue-serged,
straw-hatted, and pearl stick-pinned like other young New Yorkers who might be millionaires
or bill clerks.One afternoon at four o&rsquo;clock, in the private office of the firm, Blandford Carteret
opened a letter that a clerk had just brought to his desk. After reading it, he chuckled audibly
for nearly a minute. John looked around from his desk inquiringly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from mother,&rdquo; said Blandford. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read you the funny part of it. She tells me all the
neighborhood news first, of course, and then cautions me against getting my feet wet and
musical comedies. After that come some vital statistics about calves and pigs and an
estimate of the wheat crop. And now I&rsquo;ll quote some:
&ldquo;&lsquo;And what do you think! Old Uncle Jake, who was seventy-six last Wednesday, must go
travelling. Nothing would do but he must go to New York and see his &ldquo;young Marster
Blandford.&rdquo; Old as he is, he has a deal of common sense, so I&rsquo;ve let him go. I couldn&rsquo;t refuse
him&ndash;he seemed to have concentrated all his hopes and desires into this one adventure into
the wide world. You know he was born on the plantation, and has never been ten miles
away from it in his life. And he was your father&rsquo;s body servant during the war, and has been
always a faithful vassal and servant of the family. He has often seen the gold watch&ndash;the
watch that was your father&rsquo;s and your father&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s. I told him it was to be yours, And he
begged me to allow him to take it to you and to put it into your hands himself.
&ldquo;&lsquo;So he has it, carefully inclosed in a buck-skin case, and is bringing it to you with all the
pride and importance of a king&rsquo;s messenger. I gave him money for the round trip and for a
two weeks&rsquo; stay in the city. I wish you would see to it that he gets comfortable quarters&ndash;Jake
won&rsquo;t need much looking after&ndash;he&rsquo;s able to take care of himself. But I have read in the
papers that African bishops and colored potentates generally have much trouble in obtaining
food and lodging in the Yankee metropolis. That may be all right; but I don&rsquo;t see why the
best hotel there shouldn&rsquo;t take Jake in. Still, I suppose it&rsquo;s a rule.
&ldquo;&lsquo;I gave him full directions about finding you, and packed his valise myself. You won&rsquo;t
have to bother with him; but I do hope you&rsquo;ll see that he is made comfortable. Take the
watch that he brings you&ndash;it&rsquo;s almost a decoration. It has been worn by true Carterets, and
there isn&rsquo;t a stain upon it nor a false movement of the wheels. Bringing it to you is the
crowning joy of old Jake&rsquo;s life. I wanted him to have that little outing and that happiness
before it is too late. You have often heard us talk about how Jake, pretty badly wounded
himself, crawled through the reddened grass at Chancellorsville to where your father lay
with the bullet in his dear heart, and took the watch from his pocket to keep it from the
&ldquo;Yanks.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;So, my son, when the old man comes consider him as a frail but worthy messenger
from the old-time life and home.
&ldquo;&lsquo;You have been so long away from home and so long among the people that we have
always regarded as aliens that I&rsquo;m not sure that Jake will know you when he sees you. But
Jake has a keen perception, and I rather believe that he will know a Virginia Carteret at sight.
I can&rsquo;t conceive that even ten years in Yankee-land could change a boy of mine. Anyhow, I&rsquo;msure you will know Jake. I put eighteen collars in his valise. If he should have to buy others,
he wears a number 15 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>. Please see that he gets the right ones. He will be no trouble to
you at all.
&ldquo;&lsquo;If you are not too busy, I&rsquo;d like for you to find him a place to board where they have
white-meal corn-bread, and try to keep him from taking his shoes off in your office or on the
street. His right foot swells a little, and he likes to be comfortable.
&ldquo;&lsquo;If you can spare the time, count his handkerchiefs when they come back from the
wash. I bought him a dozen new ones before he left. He should be there about the time this
letter reaches you. I told him to go straight to your office when he arrives.&lsquo;&rdquo;
As soon as Blandford had finished the reading of this, something happened (as there
should happen in stories and must happen on the stage).
Percival, the office boy, with his air of despising the world&rsquo;s output of mill supplies and
leather belting, came in to announce that a colored gentleman was outside to see Mr.
Blandford Carteret.
&ldquo;Bring him in,&rdquo; said Blandford, rising.
John Carteret swung around in his chair and said to Percival: &ldquo;Ask him to wait a few
minutes outside. We&rsquo;ll let you know when to bring him in.&rdquo;
Then he turned to his cousin with one of those broad, slow smiles that was an
inheritance of all the Carterets, and said:
&ldquo;Bland, I&rsquo;ve always had a consuming curiosity to understand the differences that you
haughty Southerners believe to exist between &lsquo;you all &rsquo; and the people of the North. Of
course, I know that you consider yourselves made out of finer clay and look upon Adam as
only a collateral branch of your ancestry; but I don&rsquo;t know why. I never could understand the
differences between us.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, John,&rdquo; said Blandford, laughing, &ldquo;what you don&rsquo;t understand about it is just the
difference, of course. I suppose it was the feudal way in which we lived that gave us our
lordly baronial airs and feeling of superiority.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But you are not feudal, now,&rdquo; went on John. &ldquo;Since we licked you and stole your cotton
and mules you&rsquo;ve had to go to work just as we &lsquo;damyankees,&rsquo; as you call us, have always
been doing. And you&rsquo;re just as proud and exclusive and upper-classy as you were before the
war. So it wasn&rsquo;t your money that caused it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Maybe it was the climate,&rdquo; said Blandford, lightly, &ldquo;or maybe our negroes spoiled us.
I&rsquo;ll call old Jake in, now. I&rsquo;ll be glad to see the old villain again.&ldquo;&ldquo;Wait just a moment,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a little theory I want to test. You and I are
pretty much alike in our general appearance. Old Jake hasn&rsquo;t seen you since you were fifteen.
Let&rsquo;s have him in and play fair and see which of us gets the watch. The old darky surrey
ought to be able to pick out his &lsquo;young marster&rsquo; without any trouble. The alleged aristocratic
superiority of a &lsquo;reb&rsquo; ought to be visible to him at once. He couldn&rsquo;t make the mistake of
handing over the timepiece to a Yankee, of course. The loser buys the dinner this evening
and two dozen 15 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> collars for Jake. Is it a go?&rdquo;
Blandford agreed heartily. Percival was summoned, and told to usher the &ldquo;colored
gentleman&rdquo; in.
Uncle Jake stepped inside the private office cautiously. He was a little old man, as black
as soot, wrinkled and bald except for a fringe of white wool, cut decorously short, that ran
over his ears and around his head. There was nothing of the stage &ldquo;uncle&rdquo; about him: his
black suit nearly fitted him; his shoes shone, and his straw hat was banded with a gaudy
ribbon. In his right hand he carried something carefully concealed by his closed fingers.
Uncle Jake stopped a few steps from the door. Two young men sat in their revolving
desk-chairs ten feet apart and looked at him in friendly silence. His gaze slowly shifted many
times from one to the other. He felt sure that he was in the presence of one, at least, of the
revered family among whose fortunes his life had begun and was to end.
One had the pleasing but haughty Carteret air; the other had the unmistakable straight,
long family nose. Both had the keen black eyes, horizontal brows, and thin, smiling lips that
had distinguished both the Carteret of the Mayflower and him of the brigantine. Old Jake
had thought that he could have picked out his young master instantly from a thousand
Northerners; but he found himself in difficulties. The best he could do was to use strategy.
&ldquo;Howdy, Marse Blandford&ndash;howdy, suh ?&rdquo; he said, looking midway between the two
young men.
&ldquo;Howdy, Uncle Jake?&rdquo; they both answered pleasantly and in unison. &ldquo;Sit down. Have
you brought the watch ?&rdquo;
Uncle Jake chose a hard-bottom chair at a respectful distance, sat on the edge of it, and
laid his hat carefully on the floor. The watch in its buckskin case he gripped tightly. He had
not risked his life on the battle-field to rescue that watch from his &ldquo;old marster&rsquo;s&rdquo; foes to
hand it over again to the enemy without a struggle.
&ldquo;Yes, suh; I got it in my hand, suh. I&rsquo;m gwine give it to you right away in jus&rsquo; a minute.
Old Missus told me to put it in young Marse Blandford&rsquo;s hand and tell him to wear it for the
family pride and honor. It was a mighty longsome trip for an old nigger man to make&ndash; tenthousand miles, it must be, back to old Vi&rsquo;ginia, suh. You&rsquo;ve growed mightily, young marster.
I wouldn&rsquo;t have reconnized you but for yo&rsquo; powerful resemblance to old marster.&rdquo;
With admirable diplomacy the old man kept his eyes roaming in the space between the
two men. His words might have been addressed to either. Though neither wicked nor
perverse, he was seeking for a sign.
Blandford and John exchanged winks.
&ldquo;I reckon you done got you ma&rsquo;s letter,&rdquo; went on Uncle Jake. &ldquo;She said she was gwine to
write to you &lsquo;bout my comin&rsquo; along up this er- way.
&ldquo;Yes, yes, Uncle Jake,&rdquo; said John briskly. &ldquo;My cousin and I have just been notified to
expect you. We are both Carterets, you know.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Although one of us,&rdquo; said Blandford, &ldquo;was born and raised in the North.&rdquo;
&ldquo;So if you will hand over the watch&ndash;&rdquo; said John.
&ldquo;My cousin and I-&rdquo; said Blandford.
&lsquo;Will then see to it&ndash;&rdquo; said John.
&ldquo;That comfortable quarters are found for you,&rdquo; said Blandford.
With creditable ingenuity, old Jake set up a cackling, high-pitched, protracted laugh. He
beat his knee, picked up his hat and bent the brim in an apparent paroxysm of humorous
appreciation. The seizure afforded him a mask behind which he could roll his eyes
impartially between, above, and beyond his two tormentors.
&ldquo;I sees what!&rdquo; he chuckled, after a while. &ldquo;You gen&rsquo;lemen is tryin&rsquo; to have fun with the
po&rsquo; old nigger. But you can&rsquo;t fool old Jake. I knowed you, Marse Blandford, the minute I sot
eyes on you. You was a po&rsquo; skimpy little boy no mo&rsquo; than about fo&rsquo;teen when you lef&rsquo; home
to come No&rsquo;th; but I knowed you the minute I sot eyes on you. You is the mawtal image of
old marster. The other gen&rsquo;leman resembles you mightily, suh; but you can&rsquo;t fool old Jake on
a member of the old Vi&rsquo;ginia family. No suh.&rdquo;
At exactly the same time both Carterets smiled and extended a hand for the watch.
Uncle Jake&rsquo;s wrinkled, black face lost the expression of amusement to which he had
vainly twisted it. He knew that he was being teased, and that it made little real difference, as
far as its safety went, into which of those outstretched hands he placed the family treasure.
But it seemed to him that not only his own pride and loyalty but much of the Virginia
Carterets&rsquo; was at stake. He had heard down South during the war about that other branch ofthe family that lived in the North and fought on &ldquo;the yuther side,&rdquo; and it had always grieved
him. He had followed his &ldquo;old marster&rsquo;s&rdquo; fortunes from stately luxury through war to almost
poverty. And now, with the last relic and reminder of him, blessed by &ldquo;old missus,&rdquo; and
intrusted implicitly to his care, he had come ten thousand miles (as it seemed) to deliver it
into the hands of the one who was to wear it and wind it and cherish it and listen to it tick
off the unsullied hours that marked the lives of the Carterets&ndash;of Virginia.
His experience and conception of the Yankees had been an impression of
tyrants&ndash;&ldquo;low-down, common trash&rdquo;&ndash;in blue, laying waste with fire and sword. He had seen
the smoke of many burning homesteads almost as grand as Carteret Hall ascending to the
drowsy Southern skies. And now he was face to face with one of them&ndash;and he could not
distinguish him from his &ldquo;young marster&rdquo; whom he had come to find and bestow upon him
the emblem of his kingship&ndash;even as the arm &ldquo;clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful&rdquo;
laid Excalibur in the right hand of Arthur. He saw before him two young men, easy, kind,
courteous, welcoming, either of whom might have been the one he sought. Troubled,
bewildered, sorely grieved at his weakness of judgment, old Jake abandoned his loyal
subterfuges. His right hand sweated against the buckskin cover of the watch. He was deeply
humiliated and chastened. Seriously, now, his prominent, yellow-white eyes closely scanned
the two young men. At the end of his scrutiny he was conscious of but one difference
between them. One wore a narrow black tie with a white pearl stickpin. The other&rsquo;s
&ldquo;four-in-hand &rdquo; was a narrow blue one pinned with a black pearl.
And then, to old Jake&rsquo;s relief, there came a sudden distraction. Drama knocked at the
door with imperious knuckles, and forced Comedy to the wings, and Drama peeped with a
smiling but set face over the footlights.
Percival, the hater of mill supplies, brought in a card, which he handed, with the
manner of one bearing a cartel, to Blue-Tie.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Olivia De Ormond,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Blue-Tie from the card. He looked inquiringly at his cousin.
&ldquo;Why not have her in,&rdquo; said Black-Tie, &ldquo;and bring matters to a conclusion?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Uncle Jake,&rdquo; said one of the young men, &ldquo;would you mind taking that chair over there
in the corner for a while? A lady is coming in&ndash;on some business. We&rsquo;ll take up your case
afterward.&rdquo;
The lady whom Percival ushered in was young and petulantly, decidedly, freshly,
consciously, and intentionally pretty. She was dressed with such expensive plainness that she
made you consider lace and ruffles as mere tatters and rags. But one great ostrich plume
that she wore would have marked her anywhere in the army of beauty as the wearer of the
merry helmet of Navarre.Miss De Ormond accepted the swivel chair at Blue-Tie&rsquo;s desk. Then the gentlemen
drew leather-upholstered seats conveniently near, and spoke of the weather.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I noticed it was warmer. But I mustn&rsquo;t take up too much of your time
during business hours. That is,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;unless we talk business.&rdquo;
She addressed her words to Blue-Tie, with a charming smile.
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind my cousin being present, do you? We are
generally rather confidential with each other-especially in business matters.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; caroled Miss De Ormond. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather he did hear. He knows all about it,
anyhow. In fact, he&rsquo;s quite a material witness because he was present when you&ndash;when it
happened. I thought you might want to talk things over before&ndash;well, before any action is
taken, as I believe the lawyers say.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Have you anything in the way of a proposition to make?&rdquo; asked Black- Tie.
Miss De Ormond looked reflectively at the neat toe of one of her dull kid-pumps.
&ldquo;I had a proposal made to me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If the proposal sticks it cuts out the
proposition. Let&rsquo;s have that settled first.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, as far as&ndash;&rdquo; began Blue-Tie.
&ldquo;Excuse me, cousin,&rdquo; interrupted Black-Tie, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t mind my cutting in.&rdquo; And then
he turned, with a good-natured air, toward the lady.
&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s recapitulate a bit,&rdquo; he said cheerfully. &ldquo;All three of us, besides other mutual
acquaintances, have been out on a good many larks together.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to call the birds by another name,&rdquo; said Miss De Ormond.
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; responded Black-Tie, with unimpaired cheerfulness; &ldquo;suppose we say
&lsquo;squabs&rsquo; when we talk about the &lsquo;proposal&rsquo; and &lsquo;larks&rsquo; when we discuss the &lsquo;proposition.&rsquo; You
have a quick mind, Miss De Ormond. Two months ago some half-dozen of us went in a
motor-car for day&rsquo;s run into the country. We stopped at a road-house for dinner. My cousin
proposed marriage to you then and there. He was influenced to do so, of course, by the
beauty and charm which no one can deny that you possess.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I wish I had you for a press agent, Mr. Carteret,&rdquo; said the beauty, with a dazzling smile.
&ldquo;You are on the stage, Miss De Ormond,&rdquo; went on Black-Tie. &ldquo;You have had, doubtless,
many admirers, and perhaps other proposals. You must remember, too, that we were a partyof merrymakers on that occasion. There were a good many corks pulled. That the proposal
of marriage was made to you by my cousin we cannot deny. But hasn&rsquo;t it been your
experience that, by common consent, such things lose their seriousness when viewed in the
next day&rsquo;s sunlight? Isn&rsquo;t there something of a &lsquo;code&rsquo; among good &lsquo;sports&rsquo;&ndash;I use the word in
its best sense&ndash;that wipes out each day the follies of the evening previous?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Miss De Ormond. &ldquo;I know that very well. And I&rsquo;ve always played up to it.
But as you seem to be conducting the case&ndash; with the silent consent of the defendant&ndash;I&rsquo;ll tell
you something more. I&rsquo;ve got letters from him repeating the proposal. And they&rsquo;re signed,
too.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Black-Tie gravely. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your price for the letters?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a cheap one,&rdquo; said Miss De Ormond. &ldquo;But I had decided to make you a rate.
You both belong to a swell family. Well, if I am on the stage nobody can say a word against
me truthfully. And the money is only a secondary consideration. It isn&rsquo;t the money I was
after. I&ndash;I believed him&ndash;and&ndash;and I liked him.&rdquo;
She cast a soft, entrancing glance at Blue-Tie from under her long eyelashes.
&ldquo;And the price?&rdquo; went on Black-Tie, inexorably.
&ldquo;Ten thousand dollars,&rdquo; said the lady, sweetly.
&ldquo;Or&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Or the fulfillment of the engagement to marry.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I think it is time,&rdquo; interrupted Blue-Tie, &ldquo;for me to be allowed to say a word or two.
You and I, cousin, belong to a family that has held its head pretty high. You have been
brought up in a section of the country very different from the one where our branch of the
family lived. Yet both of us are Carterets, even if some of our ways and theories differ. You
remember, it is a tradition of the family, that no Carteret ever failed in chivalry to a lady or
failed to keep his word when it was given.&rdquo;
Then Blue-Tie, with frank decision showing on his countenance, turned to Miss De
Ormond.
&ldquo;Olivia,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;on what date will you marry me?&rdquo;
Before she could answer, Black-Tie again interposed.
&ldquo;It is a long journey,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;from Plymouth rock to Norfolk Bay. Between the two
points we find the changes that nearly three centuries have brought. In that time the oldorder has changed. We no longer burn witches or torture slaves. And to-day we neither
spread our cloaks on the mud for ladies to walk over nor treat them to the ducking-stool. It
is the age of common sense, adjustment, and proportion. All of us&ndash;ladies, gentlemen,
women, men, Northerners, Southerners, lords, caitiffs, actors, hardware-drummers,
senators, hodcarriers, and politicians&ndash;are coming to a better understanding. Chivalry is one
of our words that changes its meaning every day. Family pride is a thing of many
constructions&ndash;it may show itself by maintaining a moth-eaten arrogance in cobwebbed
Colonial mansion or by the prompt paying of one&rsquo;s debts.
&ldquo;Now, I suppose you&rsquo;ve had enough of my monologue. I&rsquo;ve learned something of
business and a little of life; and I somehow believe, cousin, that our great-great-grandfathers,
the original Carterets, would indorse my view of this matter.&rdquo;
Black-Tie wheeled around to his desk, wrote in a check-book and tore out the check,
the sharp rasp of the perforated leaf making the only sound in the room. He laid the check
within easy reach of Miss De Ormond&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;Business is business,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We live in a business age. There is my personal check
for $10,000. What do you say, Miss De Ormond&ndash; will it he orange blossoms or cash ?&rdquo;
Miss De Ormond picked up the cheek carelessly, folded it indifferently, and stuffed it
into her glove.
&ldquo;Oh, this&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; she said, calmly. &ldquo;I just thought I&rsquo;d call and put it up to you. I guess you
people are all right. But a girl has feelings, you know. I&rsquo;ve heard one of you was a
Southerner&ndash;I wonder which one of you it is?&rdquo;
She arose, smiled sweetly, and walked to the door. There, with a flash of white teeth
and a dip of the heavy plume, she disappeared.
Both of the cousins had forgotten Uncle Jake for the time. But now they heard the
shuffling of his shoes as he came across the rug toward them from his seat in the corner.
&ldquo;Young marster,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take yo&rsquo; watch.&rdquo; And without hesitation he laid the ancient
timepiece in the hand of its rightful owner.
The Things The Play （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Being acquainted with a newspaper reporter who had a couple of free passes, I got to
see the performance a few nights ago at one of the popular vaudeville houses.One of the numbers was a violin solo by a striking-looking man not much past forty, but
with very gray thick hair. Not being afflicted with a taste for music, I let the system of noises
drift past my ears while I regarded the man.
&ldquo;There was a story about that chap a month or two ago,&rdquo; said the reporter. &ldquo;They gave
me the assignment. It was to run a column and was to be on the extremely light and joking
order. The old man seems to like the funny touch I give to local happenings. Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m
working on a farce comedy now. Well, I went down to the house and got all the details; but I
certainly fell down on that job. I went back and turned in a comic write-up of an east side
funeral instead. Why? Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t seem to get hold of it with my funny hooks, somehow.
Maybe you could make a one-act tragedy out of it for a curtain-raiser. I&rsquo;ll give you the
details.&rdquo;
After the performance my friend, the reporter, recited to me the facts over Wurzburger.
&ldquo;I see no reason,&rdquo; said I, when he had concluded, &ldquo;why that shouldn&rsquo;t make a rattling
good funny story. Those three people couldn&rsquo;t have acted in a more absurd and
preposterous manner if they had been real actors in a real theatre. I&rsquo;m really afraid that all
the stage is a world, anyhow, and all the players men and women. &lsquo;The thing&rsquo;s the play,&rsquo; is
the way I quote Mr. Shakespeare.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Try it,&rdquo; said the reporter.
&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said I; and I did, to show him how he could have made a humorous column of it
for his paper.
There stands a house near Abingdon Square. On the ground floor there has been for
twenty-five years a little store where toys and notions and stationery are sold.
One night twenty years ago there was a wedding in the rooms above the store. The
Widow Mayo owned the house and store. Her daughter Helen was married to Frank Barry.
John Delaney was best man. Helen was eighteen, and her picture had been printed in a
morning paper next to the headlines of a &ldquo;Wholesale Female Murderess&rdquo; story from Butte,
Mont. But after your eye and intelligence had rejected the connection, you seized your
magnifying glass and read beneath the portrait her description as one of a series of
Prominent Beauties and Belles of the lower west side.
Frank Barry and John Delaney were &ldquo;prominent&rdquo; young beaux of the same side, and
bosom friends, whom you expected to turn upon each other every time the curtain went up.
One who pays his money for orchestra seats and fiction expects this. That is the first funny
idea that has turned up in the story yet. Both had made a great race for Helen&rsquo;s hand. When
Frank won, John shook his hand and congratulated him - honestly, he did.After the ceremony Helen ran upstairs to put on her hat. She was getting married in a
traveling dress. She and Frank were going to Old Point Comfort for a week. Downstairs the
usual horde of gibbering cave-dwellers were waiting with their hands full of old Congress
gaiters and paper bags of hominy.
Then there was a rattle of the fire-escape, and into her room jumps the mad and
infatuated John Delaney, with a damp curl drooping upon his forehead, and made violent
and reprehensible love to his lost one, entreating her to flee or fly with him to the Riviera, or
the Bronx, or any old place where there are Italian skies and dolce far niente.
It would have carried Blaney off his feet to see Helen repulse him. With blazing and
scornful eyes she fairly withered him by demanding whatever he meant by speaking to
respectable people that way.
In a few moments she had him going. The manliness that had possessed him departed.
He bowed low, and said something about &ldquo;irresistible impulse&rdquo; and &ldquo;forever carry in his
heart the memory of&rdquo; - and she suggested that he catch the first fire-escape going down.
&ldquo;I will away,&rdquo; said John Delaney, &ldquo;to the furthermost parts of the earth. I cannot remain
near you and know that you are another&rsquo;s. I will to Africa, and there amid other scenes strive
to for -&rdquo;
&ldquo;For goodness sake, get out,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Somebody might come in.&rdquo;
He knelt upon one knee, and she extended him one white hand that he might give it a
farewell kiss.
Girls, was this choice boon of the great little god Cupid ever vouchsafed you - to have
the fellow you want hard and fast, and have the one you don&rsquo;t want come with a damp curl
on his forehead and kneel to you and babble of Africa and love which, in spite of everything,
shall forever bloom, an amaranth, in his heart? To know your power, and to feel the sweet
security of your own happy state; to send the unlucky one, broken-hearted, to foreign climes,
while you congratulate yourself as he presses his last kiss upon your knuckles, that your nails
are well manicured - say, girls, it&rsquo;s galluptious - don&rsquo;t ever let it get by you.
And then, of course - how did you guess it? - the door opened and in stalked the
bridegroom, jealous of slow-tying bonnet strings.
The farewell kiss was imprinted upon Helen&rsquo;s hand, and out of the window and down
the fire-escape sprang John Delaney, Africa bound.
A little slow music, if you please - faint violin, just a breath in the clarinet and a touch of
the &lsquo;cello. Imagine the scene. Frank, white-hot, with the cry of a man wounded to death
bursting from him. Helen, rushing and clinging to him, trying to explain. He catches herwrists and tears them from his shoulders - once, twice, thrice he sways her this way and that
- the stage manager will show you how - and throws her from him to the floor a huddled,
crushed, moaning thing. Never, he cries, will he look upon her face again, and rushes from
the house through the staring groups of astonished guests.
And, now because it is the Thing instead of the Play, the audience must stroll out into
the real lobby of the world and marry, die, grow gray, rich, poor, happy or sad during the
intermission of twenty years which must precede the rising of the curtain again.
Mrs. Barry inherited the shop and the house. At thirty-eight she could have bested
many an eighteen-year-old at a beauty show on points and general results. Only a few
people remembered her wedding comedy, but she made of it no secret. She did not pack it
in lavender or moth balls, nor did she sell it to a magazine.
One day a middle-aged money-making lawyer, who bought his legal cap and ink of her,
asked her across the counter to marry him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really much obliged to you,&rdquo; said Helen, cheerfully, &ldquo;but I married another man
twenty years ago. He was more a goose than a man, but I think I love him yet. I have never
seen him since about half an hour after the ceremony. Was it copying ink that you wanted or
just writing fluid?&rdquo;
The lawyer bowed over the counter with old-time grace and left a respectful kiss on the
back of her hand. Helen sighed. Parting salutes, however romantic, may be overdone. Here
she was at thirty-eight, beautiful and admired; and all that she seemed to have got from her
lovers were approaches and adieus. Worse still, in the last one she had lost a customer, too.
Business languished, and she hung out a Room to Let card. Two large rooms on the
third floor were prepared for desirable tenants. Roomers came, and went regretfully, for the
house of Mrs. Barry was the abode of neatness, comfort and taste.
One day came Ramonti, the violinist, and engaged the front room above. The discord
and clatter uptown offended his nice ear; so a friend had sent him to this oasis in the desert
of noise.
Ramonti, with his still youthful face, his dark eyebrows, his short, pointed, foreign,
brown beard, his distinguished head of gray hair, and his artist&rsquo;s temperament - revealed in
his light, gay and sympathetic manner - was a welcome tenant in the old house near
Abingdon Square.
Helen lived on the floor above the store. The architecture of it was singular and quaint.
The hall was large and almost square. Up one side of it, and then across the end of it
ascended an open stairway to the floor above. This hall space she had furnished as a sitting
room and office combined. There she kept her desk and wrote her business letters; andthere she sat of evenings by a warm fire and a bright red light and sewed or read. Ramonti
found the atmosphere so agreeable that he spent much time there, describing to Mrs. Barry
the wonders of Paris, where he had studied with a particularly notorious and noisy fiddler.
Next comes lodger No. 2, a handsome, melancholy man in the early 40&rsquo;s, with a brown,
mysterious beard, and strangely pleading, haunting eyes. He, too, found the society of Helen
a desirable thing. With the eyes of Romeo and Othello&rsquo;s tongue, he charmed her with tales
of distant climes and wooed her by respectful innuendo.
From the first Helen felt a marvelous and compelling thrill in the presence of this man.
His voice somehow took her swiftly back to the days of her youth&rsquo;s romance. This feeling
grew, and she gave way to it, and it led her to an instinctive belief that he had been a factor
in that romance. And then with a woman&rsquo;s reasoning (oh, yes, they do, sometimes) she
leaped over common syllogism and theory, and logic, and was sure that her husband had
come back to her. For she saw in his eyes love, which no woman can mistake, and a
thousand tons of regret and remorse, which aroused pity, which is perilously near to love
requited, which is the sine qua non in the house that Jack built.
But she made no sign. A husband who steps around the corner for twenty years and
then drops in again should not expect to find his slippers laid out too conveniently near nor
a match ready lighted for his cigar. There must be expiation, explanation, and possibly
execration. A little purgatory, and then, maybe, if he were properly humble, he might be
trusted with a harp and crown. And so she made no sign that she knew or suspected.
And my friend, the reporter, could see nothing funny in this! Sent out on an assignment
to write up a roaring, hilarious, brilliant joshing story of - but I will not knock a brother - let
us go on with the story.
One evening Ramonti stopped in Helen&rsquo;s hall-office-reception-room and told his love
with the tenderness and ardor of the enraptured artist. His words were a bright flame of the
divine fire that glows in the heart of a man who is a dreamer and doer combined.
&ldquo;But before you give me an answer,&rdquo; he went on, before she could accuse him of
suddenness, &ldquo;I must tell you that &lsquo;Ramonti&rsquo; is the only name I have to offer you. My manager
gave me that. I do not know who I am or where I came from. My first recollection is of
opening my eyes in a hospital. I was a young man, and I had been there for weeks. My life
before that is a blank to me. They told me that I was found lying in the street with a wound
on my head and was brought there in an ambulance. They thought I must have fallen and
struck my head upon the stones. There was nothing to show who I was. I have never been
able to remember. After I was discharged from the hospital, I took up the violin. I have had
success. Mrs. Barry - I do not know your name except that - I love you; the first time I saw
you I realized that you were the one woman in the world for me - and&rdquo; - oh, a lot of stuff like
that.Helen felt young again. First a wave of pride and a sweet little thrill of vanity went all
over her; and then she looked Ramonti in the eyes, and a tremendous throb went through
her heart. She hadn&rsquo;t expected that throb. It took her by surprise. The musician had become
a big factor in her life, and she hadn&rsquo;t been aware of it.
&ldquo;Mr. Ramonti,&rdquo; she said sorrowfully (this was not on the stage, remember; it was in the
old home near Abingdon Square), &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, but I&rsquo;m a married woman.&rdquo;
And then she told him the sad story of her life, as a heroine must do, sooner or later,
either to a theatrical manager or to a reporter.
Ramonti took her hand, bowed low and kissed it, and went up to his room.
Helen sat down and looked mournfully at her hand. Well she might. Three suitors had
kissed it, mounted their red roan steeds and ridden away.
In an hour entered the mysterious stranger with the haunting eyes. Helen was in the
willow rocker, knitting a useless thing in cotton-wool. He ricocheted from the stairs and
stopped for a chat. Sitting across the table from her, he also poured out his narrative of love.
And then he said: &ldquo;Helen, do you not remember me? I think I have seen it in your eyes. Can
you forgive the past and remember the love that has lasted for twenty years? I wronged you
deeply - I was afraid to come back to you - but my love overpowered my reason. Can you,
will you, forgive me?&rdquo;
Helen stood up. The mysterious stranger held one of her hands in a strong and
trembling clasp.
There she stood, and I pity the stage that it has not acquired a scene like that and her
emotions to portray.
For she stood with a divided heart. The fresh, unforgettable, virginal love for her
bridegroom was hers; the treasured, sacred, honored memory of her first choice filled half
her soul. She leaned to that pure feeling. Honor and faith and sweet, abiding romance
bound her to it. But the other half of her heart and soul was filled with something else - a
later, fuller, nearer influence. And so the old fought against the new.
And while she hesitated, from the room above came the soft, racking, petitionary music
of a violin. The hag, music, bewitches some of the noblest. The daws may peck upon one&rsquo;s
sleeve without injury, but whoever wears his heart upon his tympanum gets it not far from
the neck.
This music and the musician caller her, and at her side honor and the old love held her
back.&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he pleaded.
&ldquo;Twenty years is a long time to remain away from the one you say you love,&rdquo; she
declared, with a purgatorial touch.
&ldquo;How could I tell?&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I will conceal nothing from you. That night when he left
I followed him. I was mad with jealousy. On a dark street I struck him down. He did not rise. I
examined him. His head had struck a stone. I did not intend to kill him. I was mad with love
and jealousy. I hid near by and saw an ambulance take him away. Although you married him,
Helen -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; cried the woman, with wide-open eyes, snatching her hand away.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember me, Helen - the one who has always loved you best? I am John
Delaney. If you can forgive -&rdquo;
But she was gone, leaping, stumbling, hurrying, flying up the stairs toward the music
and him who had forgotten, but who had known her for his in each of his two existences,
and as she climbed up she sobbed, cried and sang: &ldquo;Frank! Frank! Frank!&rdquo;
Three mortals thus juggling with years as though they were billiard balls, and my friend,
the reporter, couldn&rsquo;t see anything funny in it!
The Third Ingredient （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The (so-called) Vallambrosa Apartment-House is not an apartment-house. It is
composed of two old-fashioned, brownstone-front residences welded into one. The parlor
floor of one side is gay with the wraps and head-gear of a modiste; the other is lugubrious
with the sophistical promises and grisly display of a painless dentist. You may have a room
there for two dollars a week or you may have one for twenty dollars. Among the
Vallambrosa&rsquo;s roomers are stenographers, musicians, brokers, shop-girls, space-rate writers,
art students, wire-tappers, and other people who lean far over the banister-rail when the
door-bell rings.
This treatise shall have to do with but two of the Vallambrosians&ndash; though meaning no
disrespect to the others.
At six o&rsquo;clock one afternoon Hetty Pepper came back to her third-floor rear $3.50 room
in the Vallambrosa with her nose and chin more sharply pointed than usual. To be
discharged from the department store where you have been working four years, and withonly fifteen cents in your purse, does have a tendency to make your features appear more
finely chiseled.
And now for Hetty&rsquo;s thumb-nail biography while she climbs the two flights of stairs.
She walked into the Biggest Store one morning four years before with seventy-five
other girls, applying for a job behind the waist department counter. The phalanx of
wage-earners formed a bewildering scene of beauty, carrying a total mass of blond hair
sufficient to have justified the horseback gallops of a hundred Lady Godivas.
The capable, cool-eyed, impersonal, young, bald-headed man whose task it was to
engage six of the contestants, was aware of a feeling of suffocation as if he were drowning in
a sea of frangipanni, while white clouds, hand-embroidered, floated about him. And then a
sail hove in sight. Hetty Pepper, homely of countenance, with small, contemptuous, green
eyes and chocolate-colored hair, dressed in a suit of plain burlap and a common-sense hat,
stood before him with every one of her twenty-nine years of life unmistakably in sight.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on!.&rdquo; shouted the bald-headed young man, and was saved. And that is how
Hetty came to be employed in the Biggest Store. The story of her rise to an
eight-dollar-a-week salary is the combined stories of Hercules, Joan of Arc, Una, Job, and
Little-Red-Riding-Hood. You shall not learn from me the salary that was paid her as a
beginner. There is a sentiment growing about such things, and I want no millionaire
store-proprietors climbing the fire-escape of my tenement- house to throw dynamite bombs
into my skylight boudoir.
The story of Hetty&rsquo;s discharge from the Biggest Store is so nearly a repetition of her
engagement as to be monotonous.
In each department of the store there is an omniscient, omnipresent, and omnivorous
person carrying always a mileage book and a red necktie, and referred to as a &ldquo;buyer.&rdquo; The
destinies of the girls in his department who live on (see Bureau of Victual Statistics)&ndash;so
much per week are in his hands.
This particular buyer was a capable, cool-eyed, impersonal, young, bald-headed man.
As he walked along the aisles of his department lie seemed to be sailing on a sea of
frangipanni, while white clouds, machine-embroidered, floated around him. Too many
sweets bring surfeit. He looked upon Hetty Pepper&rsquo;s homely countenance, emerald eyes,
and chocolate-colored hair as a welcome oasis of green in a desert of cloying beauty. In a
quiet angle of a counter he pinched her arm kindly, three inches above the elbow. She
slapped him three feet away with one good blow of her muscular and not especially lilywhite right. So, now you know why Hetty Pepper came to leave the Biggest Store at thirty
minutes&rsquo; notice, with one dime and a nickel in her purse.This morning&rsquo;s quotations list the price of rib beef at six cents per (butcher&rsquo;s) pound.
But on the day that Hetty was &ldquo;released&rdquo; by the B. S. the price was seven and one-half cents.
That fact is what makes this story possible. Otherwise, the extra four cents would have&ndash;
But the plot of nearly all the good stories in the world is concerned with shorts who
were unable to cover; so you can find no fault with this one.
Hetty mounted with her rib beef to her $3.50 third-floor back. One hot, savory
beef-stew for supper, a night&rsquo;s good sleep, and she would be fit in the morning to apply
again for the tasks of Hercules, Joan of Arc, Una, Job, and Little-Red-Riding-Hood.
In her room she got the granite-ware stew-pan out of the 2x4-foot china&ndash;er&ndash;I mean
earthenware closet, and began to dig down in a rats&rsquo;-nest of paper bags for the potatoes and
onions. She came out with her nose and chin just a little sharper pointed.
There was neither a potato nor an onion. Now, what kind of a beef- Stew can you make
out of simply beef? You can make oyster-soup without oysters, turtle-soup without turtles,
coffee-cake without coffee, but you can&rsquo;t make beef-stew without potatoes and onions.
But rib beef alone, in an emergency, can make an ordinary pine door look like a
wrought-iron gambling-house portal to the wolf. With salt and pepper and a tablespoonful
of flour (first well stirred in a little cold water) &lsquo;twill serve&ndash;&lsquo;tis not so deep as a lobster a la
Newburg nor so wide as a church festival doughnut; but &lsquo;twill serve.
Hetty took her stew-pan to the rear of the third-floor hall. According to the
advertisements of the Vallambrosa there was running water to be found there. Between you
and me and the water-meter, it only ambled or walked through the faucets; but
technicalities have no place here. There was also a sink where housekeeping roomers often
met to dump their coffee grounds and glare at one another&rsquo;s kimonos.
At this sink Hetty found a girl with heavy, gold-brown, artistic hair and plaintive eyes,
washing two large &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; potatoes. Hetty knew the Vallambrosa as well as any one not
owning &ldquo;double hextra- magnifying eyes&rdquo; could compass its mysteries. The kimonos were
her encyclopedia, her &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s What?&rdquo; her clearinghouse of news, of goers and comers. From
a rose-pink kimono edged with Nile green she had learned that the girl with the potatoes
was a miniature-painter living in a kind of attic&ndash;or &ldquo;studio,&rdquo; as they prefer to call it&ndash;on the
top floor. Hetty was not certain in her mind what a miniature was; but it certainly wasn&rsquo;t a
house; because house-painters, although they wear splashy overalls and poke ladders in
your face on the street, are known to indulge in a riotous profusion of food at home.
The potato girl was quite slim and small, and handled her potatoes as an old bachelor
uncle handles a baby who is cutting teeth. She had a dull shoemaker&rsquo;s knife in her right hand,
and she had begun to peel one of the potatoes with it.Hetty addressed her in the punctiliously formal tone of one who intends to be
cheerfully familiar with you in the second round.
&ldquo;Beg pardon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for butting into what&rsquo;s not my business, but if you peel them
potatoes you lose out. They&rsquo;re new Bermudas. You want to scrape &lsquo;em. Lemme show you.&rdquo;
She took a potato and the knife, and began to demonstrate.
&ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; breathed the artist. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know. And I did hate to see the thick
peeling go; it seemed such a waste. But I thought they always had to be peeled. When
you&rsquo;ve got only potatoes to eat, the peelings count, you know.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Say, kid,&rdquo; said Hetty, staying her knife, &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t up against it, too, are you?&rdquo;
The miniature artist smiled starvedly.
&ldquo;I suppose I am. Art&ndash;or, at least, the way I interpret it&ndash;doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much in
demand. I have only these potatoes for my dinner. But they aren&rsquo;t so bad boiled and hot,
with a little butter and salt.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Child,&rdquo; said Hetty, letting a brief smile soften her rigid features, &ldquo;Fate has sent me and
you together. I&rsquo;ve had it handed to me in the neck, too; but I&rsquo;ve got a chunk of meat in my,
room as big as a lap-dog. And I&rsquo;ve done everything to get potatoes except pray for &lsquo;em. Let&rsquo;s
me and you bunch our commissary departments and make a stew of &lsquo;em. We&rsquo;ll cook it in my
room. If we only had an onion to go in it! Say, kid, you haven&rsquo;t got a couple of pennies
that&rsquo;ve slipped down into the lining of your last winter&rsquo;s sealskin, have you? I could step
down to the corner and get one at old Giuseppe&rsquo;s stand. A stew without an onion is worse&rsquo;n
a matinee without candy.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You may call me Cecilia,&rdquo; said the artist. &ldquo;No; I spent my last penny three days ago.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to cut the onion out instead of slicing it in,&rdquo; said Hetty. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d ask the
janitress for one, but I don&rsquo;t want &lsquo;em hep just yet to the fact that I&rsquo;m pounding the asphalt
for another job. But I wish we did have an onion.&rdquo;
In the shop-girl&rsquo;s room the two began to prepare their supper. Cecilia&rsquo;s part was to sit
on the couch helplessly and beg to be allowed to do something, in the voice of a cooing
ring-dove. Hetty prepared the rib beef, putting it in cold salted water in the stew-pan and
setting it on the one-burner gas-stove.
&ldquo;I wish we had an onion,&rdquo; said Hetty, as she scraped the two potatoes.On the wall opposite the couch was pinned a flaming, gorgeous advertising picture of
one of the new ferry-boats of the P. U. F. F. Railroad that had been built to cut down the time
between Los Angeles and New York City one-eighth of a minute.
Hetty, turning her head during her continuous monologue, saw tears running from her
guest&rsquo;s eyes as she gazed on the idealized presentment of the speeding, foam-girdled
transport.
&ldquo;Why, say, Cecilia, kid,&rdquo; said Hetty, poising her knife, &ldquo;is it as bad art as that? I ain&rsquo;t a
critic; but I thought it kind of brightened up the room. Of course, a manicure-painter could
tell it was a bum picture in a minute. I&rsquo;ll take it down if you say so. I wish to the holy Saint
Potluck we had an onion.&rdquo;
But the miniature miniature-painter had tumbled down, sobbing, with her nose
indenting the hard-woven drapery of the couch. Something was here deeper than the
artistic temperament offended at crude lithography.
Hetty knew. She had accepted her role long ago. How scant the words with which we
try to describe a single quality of a human being! When we reach the abstract we are lost.
The nearer to Nature that the babbling of our lips comes, the better do we understand.
Figuratively (let us say), some people are Bosoms, some are Hands, some are Heads, some
are Muscles, some are Feet, some are Backs for burdens.
Hetty was a Shoulder. Hers was a sharp, sinewy shoulder; but all her life people had laid
their heads upon it, metaphorically or actually, and had left there all or half their troubles.
Looking at Life anatomically, which is as good a way as any, she was preordained to be a
Shoulder. There were few truer collar-bones anywhere than hers.
Hetty was only thirty-three, and she had not yet outlived the little pang that visited her
whenever the head of youth and beauty leaned upon her for consolation. But one glance in
her mirror always served as an instantaneous pain-killer. So she gave one pale look into the
crinkly old looking-glass on the wall above the gas-stove, turned down the flame a little
lower from the bubbling beef and potatoes, went over to the couch, and lifted Cecilia&rsquo;s head
to its confessional.
&ldquo;Go on and tell me, honey,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know now that it ain&rsquo;t art that&rsquo;s worrying you.
You met him on a ferry-boat, didn&rsquo;t you? Go on, Cecilia, kid, and tell your&ndash;your Aunt Hetty
about it.&rdquo;
But youth and melancholy must first spend the surplus of sighs and tears that waft and
float the barque of romance to its harbor in the delectable isles. Presently, through the
stringy tendons that formed the bars of the confessional, the penitent&ndash;or was it the glorified
communicant of the sacred flame&ndash;told her story without art or illumination.&ldquo;It was only three days ago. I was coming back on the ferry from Jersey City. Old Mr.
Schrum, an art dealer, told me of a rich man in Newark who wanted a miniature of his
daughter painted. I went to see him and showed him some of my work. When I told him the
price would be fifty dollars he laughed at me like a hyena. He said an enlarged crayon twenty
times the size would cost him only eight dollars.
&ldquo;I had just enough money to buy my ferry ticket back to New York. I felt as if I didn&rsquo;t
want to live another day. I must have looked as I felt, for I saw him on the row of seats
opposite me, looking at me as if he understood. He was nice-looking, but oh, above
everything else, he looked kind. When one is tired or unhappy or hopeless, kindness counts
more than anything else.
&ldquo;When I got so miserable that I couldn&rsquo;t fight against it any longer, I got up and walked
slowly out the rear door of the ferry-boat cabin. No one was there, and I slipped quickly over
the rail and dropped into the water. Oh, friend Hetty, it was cold, cold!
&ldquo;For just one moment I wished I was back in the old Vallambrosa, starving and hoping.
And then I got numb, and didn&rsquo;t care. And then I felt that somebody else was in the water
close by me, holding me up. He had followed me, and jumped in to save me.
&ldquo;Somebody threw a thing like a big, white doughnut at us, and he made me put my
arms through the hole. Then the ferry-boat backed, and they pulled us on board. Oh, Hetty, I
was so ashamed of my wickedness in trying to drown myself; and, besides, my hair had all
tumbled down and was sopping wet, and I was such a sight.
&ldquo;And then some men in blue clothes came around; and he gave them his card, and I
heard him tell them he had seen me drop my purse on the edge of the boat outside the rail,
and in leaning over to get it I had fallen overboard.
And then I remembered having read in the papers that people who try to kill
themselves are locked up in cells with people who try to kill other people, and I was afraid.
&ldquo;But some ladies on the boat took me downstairs to the furnace-room and got me
nearly dry and did up my hair. When the boat landed, he came and put me in a cab. He was
all dripping himself, but laughed as if he thought it was all a joke. He begged me, but I
wouldn&rsquo;t tell him my name nor where I lived, I was so ashamed.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You were a fool, child,&rdquo; said Hetty, kindly. &ldquo;Wait till I turn the light up a bit. I wish to
Heaven we had an onion.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then he raised his hat,&rdquo; went on Cecilia, &ldquo;and said: &lsquo;Very well. But I&rsquo;ll find you, anyhow.
I&rsquo;m going to claim my rights of salvage.&rsquo; Then he gave money to the cab-driver and told him
to take me where I wanted to go, and walked away. What is &lsquo;salvage,&rsquo; Hetty?&ldquo;&ldquo;The edge of a piece of goods that ain&rsquo;t hemmed,&rdquo; said the shop-girl. &ldquo;You must have
looked pretty well frazzled out to the little hero boy.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been three days,&rdquo; moaned the miniature-painter, &ldquo;and he hasn&rsquo;t found me yet.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Extend the time,&rdquo; said Hetty. &ldquo;This is a big town. Think of how many girls he might
have to see soaked in water with their hair down before he would recognize you. The stew&rsquo;s
getting on fine&ndash;but oh, for an onion! I&rsquo;d even use a piece&rsquo;of garlic if I had it.&rdquo;
The beef and potatoes bubbled merrily, exhaling a mouth-watering savor that yet
lacked something, leaving a hunger on the palate, a haunting, wistful desire for some lost
and needful ingredient.
&ldquo;I came near drowning in that awful river,&rdquo; said Cecilia, shuddering.
&ldquo;It ought to have more water in it,&rdquo; said Hetty; &ldquo;the stew, I mean. I&rsquo;ll go get some at the
sink.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It smells good,&rdquo; said the artist.
&ldquo;That nasty old North River?&rdquo; objected Hetty. &ldquo;It smells to me like soap factories and
wet setter-dogs&ndash;oh, you mean the stew. Well, I wish we had an onion for it. Did he look like
he had money?&rdquo;
&ldquo;First, he looked kind,&rdquo; said Cecilia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he was rich; but that matters so little.
When he drew out his bill-folder to pay the cab-man you couldn&rsquo;t help seeing hundreds and
thousands of dollars in it. And I looked over the cab doors and saw him leave the ferry
station in a motor-car; and the chauffeur gave him his bearskin to put on, for he was sopping
wet. And it was only three days ago.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What a fool!&rdquo; said Hetty, shortly.
&ldquo;Oh, the chauffeur wasn&rsquo;t wet,&rdquo; breathed Cecilia. &ldquo;And he drove the car away very
nicely.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I mean you,&rdquo; said Hetty. &ldquo;For not giving him your address.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I never give my address to chauffeurs,&rdquo; said Cecilia, haughtily.
&ldquo;I wish we had one,&rdquo; said Hetty, disconsolately.
&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
&ldquo;For the stew, of course&ndash;oh, I mean an onion.&ldquo;Hetty took a pitcher and started to the sink at the end of the hall.
A young man came down the stairs from above just as she was opposite the lower step.
He was decently dressed, but pale and haggard. His eyes were dull with the stress of some
burden of physical or mental woe. In his hand he bore an onion&ndash;a pink, smooth, solid,
shining onion as large around as a ninety-eight-cent alarm-clock.
Hetty stopped. So did the young man. There was something Joan of Arc-ish, Herculean,
and Una-ish in the look and pose of the shoplady&ndash; she had cast off the roles of Job and
Little-Red-Riding-Hood. The young man stopped at the foot of the stairs and coughed
distractedly. He felt marooned, held up, attacked, assailed, levied upon, sacked, assessed,
panhandled, browbeaten, though he knew not why. It was the look in Hetty&rsquo;s eyes that did it.
In them he saw the Jolly Roger fly to the masthead and an able seaman with a dirk between
his teeth scurry up the ratlines and nail it there. But as yet he did not know that the cargo he
carried was the thing that had caused him to be so nearly blown out of the water without
even a parley.
&ldquo;Beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Hetty, as sweetly as her dilute acetic acid tones permitted, &ldquo;but
did you find that onion on the stairs? There was a hole in the paper bag; and I&rsquo;ve just come
out to look for it.&rdquo;
The young man coughed for half a minute. The interval may have given him the courage
to defend his own property. Also, he clutched his pungent prize greedily, and, with a show of
spirit, faced his grim waylayer.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said huskily, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t find it on the stairs. It was given to me by Jack Bevens, on
the top floor. If you don&rsquo;t believe it, ask him. I&rsquo;ll wait until you do.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know about Bevens,&rdquo; said Hetty, sourly. &ldquo;He writes books and things up there for the
paper-and-rags man. We can hear the postman guy him all over the house when he brings
them thick envelopes back. Say&ndash;do you live in the Vallambrosa?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I come to see Bevens sometimes. He&rsquo;s my friend. I live
two blocks west.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What are you going to do with the onion?
&ndash;begging your pardon,&rdquo; said Hetty.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to eat it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Raw?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes: as soon as I get home.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got anything else to eat with it?&rdquo;
The young man considered briefly.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he confessed; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not another scrap of anything in my diggings to eat. I think
old Jack is pretty hard up for grub in his shack, too. He hated to give up the onion, but I
worried him into parting with it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; said Hetty, fixing him with her world-sapient eyes, and laying a bony but
impressive finger on his sleeve, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve known trouble, too, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lots,&rdquo; said the onion owner, promptly. &ldquo;But this onion is my own property, honestly
come by. If you will excuse me, I must be going.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Hetty, paling a little with anxiety. &ldquo;Raw onion is a mighty poor diet. And so
is a beef-stew without one. Now, if you&rsquo;re Jack Bevens&rsquo; friend, I guess you&rsquo;re nearly right.
There&rsquo;s a little lady&ndash;a friend of mine&ndash;in my room there at the end of the hall. Both of us are
out of luck; and we had just potatoes and meat between us. They&rsquo;re stewing now. But it ain&rsquo;t
got any soul. There&rsquo;s something lacking to it. There&rsquo;s certain things in life that are naturally
intended to fit and belong together. One is pink cheese-cloth and green roses, and one is
ham and eggs, and one is Irish and trouble. And the other one is beef and potatoes with
onions. And still another one is people who are up against it and other people in the same
fix.&rdquo;
The young man went into a protracted paroxysm of coughing. With one hand he
hugged his onion to his bosom.
&ldquo;No doubt; no doubt,&rdquo; said he, at length. &ldquo;But, as I said, I must be going, because&ndash;&rdquo;
Hetty clutched his sleeve firmly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a Dago, Little Brother. Don&rsquo;t cat raw onions. Chip it in toward the dinner and
line yourself inside with the best stew you ever licked a spoon over. Must two ladies knock a
young gentleman down and drag him inside for the honor of dining with &lsquo;em? No harm shall
befall you, Little Brother. Loosen up and fall into line.&rdquo;
The young man&rsquo;s pale face relaxed into a grin.
&ldquo;Believe I&rsquo;ll go you,&rdquo; he said, brightening. &ldquo;If my onion is good as a credential, I&rsquo;ll accept
the invitation gladly.&ldquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good as that, but better as seasoning,&rdquo; said Hetty. &ldquo;You come and stand outside the
door till I ask my lady friend if she has any objections. And don&rsquo;t run away with that letter of
recommendation before I come out.&rdquo;
Hetty went into her room and closed the door. The young man waited outside.
&ldquo;Cecilia, kid,&rdquo; said the shop-girl, oiling the sharp saw of her voice as well as she could,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s an onion outside. With a young man attached. I&rsquo;ve asked him in to dinner. You ain&rsquo;t
going to kick, are you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said Cecilia, sitting up and patting her artistic hair. She cast a mournful
glance at the ferry-boat poster on the wall.
&ldquo;Nit,&rdquo; said Hetty. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t him. You&rsquo;re up against real life now. I believe you said your
hero friend had money and automobiles. This is a poor skeezicks that&rsquo;s got nothing to eat
but an onion. But he&rsquo;s easy-spoken and not a freshy. I imagine he&rsquo;s been a gentleman, he&rsquo;s
so low down now. And we need the onion. Shall I bring him in? I&rsquo;ll guarantee his behavior.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hetty, dear,&rdquo; sighed Cecilia, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so hungry. What difference does it make whether he&rsquo;s
a prince or a burglar? I don&rsquo;t care. Bring him in if he&rsquo;s got anything to eat with him.&rdquo;
Hetty went back into the hall. The onion man was gone. Her heart missed a beat, and a
gray look settled over her face except on her nose and cheek-bones. And then the tides of
life flowed in again, for she saw him leaning out of the front window at the other end of the
hall. She hurried there. He was shouting to some one below. The noise of the street
overpowered the sound of her footsteps. She looked down over his shoulder, saw whom he
was speaking to, and heard his words. He pulled himself in from the window-sill and saw her
standing over him.
Hetty&rsquo;s eyes bored into him like two steel gimlets.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to me,&rdquo; she said, calmly. &ldquo;What were you going to do with that onion?&rdquo;
The young man suppressed a cough and faced her resolutely. His manner was that of
one who had been bearded sufficiently.
&ldquo;I was going to eat it,&rdquo; said he, with emphatic slowness; &ldquo;just as I told you before.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And you have nothing else to eat at home?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not a thing.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What kind of work do you do?&rdquo;&ldquo;I am not working at anything just now.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; said Hetty, with her voice set on its sharpest edge, &ldquo;do you lean out of
windows and give orders to chauffeurs in green automobiles in the street below?&rdquo;
The young man flushed, and his dull eyes began to sparkle.
&ldquo;Because, madam,&rdquo; said he, in accelerando tones, &ldquo;I pay the chauffeur&rsquo;s wages and I
own the automobile&ndash;and also this onion&ndash;this onion, madam.&rdquo;
He flourished the onion within an inch of Hetty&rsquo;s nose. The shop-lady did not retreat a
hair&rsquo;s-breadth.
&ldquo;Then why do you eat onions,&rdquo; she said, with biting contempt, &ldquo;and nothing else?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I never said I did,&rdquo; retorted the young man, heatedly. &ldquo;I said I had nothing else to eat
where I live. I am not a delicatessen store- keeper.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; pursued Hetty, inflexibly, &ldquo;were you going to eat a raw onion?&rdquo;
&ldquo;My mother,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;always made me eat one for a cold. Pardon my
referring to a physical infirmity; but you may have noticed that I have a very, very severe cold.
I was going to eat the onion and go to bed. I wonder why I am standing here and apologizing
to you for it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How did you catch this cold?&rdquo; went on Hetty, suspiciously.
The young man seemed to have arrived at some extreme height of feeling. There were
two modes of descent open to him&ndash;a burst of rage or a surrender to the ridiculous. He
chose wisely; and the empty hall echoed his hoarse laughter.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dandy,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t blame you for being careful. I don&rsquo;t mind telling
you. I got wet. I was on a North River ferry a few days ago when a girl jumped overboard. Of
course, I&ndash;&rdquo;
Hetty extended her hand, interrupting his story.
&ldquo;Give me the onion,&rdquo; she said.
The young man set his jaw a trifle harder.
&ldquo;Give me the onion,&rdquo; she repeated.
He grinned, and laid it in her hand.Then Hetty&rsquo;s infrequent, grim, melancholy smile showed itself. She took the young
man&rsquo;s arm and pointed with her other hand to the door of her room.
&ldquo;Little Brother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;go in there. The little fool you fished out of the river is there
waiting for you. Go on in. I&rsquo;ll give you three minutes before I come. Potatoes is in there,
waiting. Go on in, Onions.&rdquo;
After he had tapped at the door and entered, Hetty began to peel and wash the onion
at the sink. She gave a gray look at the gray roofs outside, and the smile on her face vanished
by little jerks and twitches.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s us,&rdquo; she said, grimly, to herself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s us that furnishes the beef.&rdquo;
To Him Who Waits （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The Hermit of the Hudson was hustling about his cave with unusual animation.
The cave was on or in the top of a little spur of the Catskills that had strayed down to
the river&rsquo;s edge, and, not having a ferry ticket, had to stop there. The bijou mountains were
densely wooded and were infested by ferocious squirrels and woodpeckers that forever
menaced the summer transients. Like a badly sewn strip of white braid, a macadamized road
ran between the green skirt of the hills and the foamy lace of the river&rsquo;s edge. A dim path
wound from the comfortable road up a rocky height to the hermit&rsquo;s cave. One mile upstream
was the Viewpoint Inn, to which summer folk from the city came; leaving cool,
electric-fanned apartments that they might be driven about in burning sunshine, shrieking,
in gasoline launches, by spindle-legged Modreds bearing the blankest of shields.
Train your lorgnette upon the hermit and let your eye receive the personal touch that
shall endear you to the hero.
A man of forty, judging him fairly, with long hair curling at the ends, dramatic eyes, and
a forked brown beard like those that were imposed upon the West some years ago by
self-appointed &ldquo;divine healers&rdquo; who succeeded the grasshopper crop. His outward vesture
appeared to be kind of gunny-sacking cut and made into a garment that would have made
the fortune of a London tailor. His long, well-shaped fingers, delicate nose, and poise of
manner raised him high above the class of hermits who fear water and bury money in
oyster-cans in their caves in spots indicated by rude crosses chipped in the stone wall above.The hermit&rsquo;s home was not altogether a cave. The cave was an addition to the
hermitage, which was a rude hut made of poles daubed with clay and covered with the best
quality of rust-proof zinc roofing.
In the house proper there were stone slabs for seats, a rustic bookcase made of
unplaned poplar planks, and a table formed of a wooden slab laid across two upright pieces
of granite&ndash;something between the furniture of a Druid temple and that of a Broadway
beefsteak dungeon. Hung against the walls were skins of wild animals purchased in the
vicinity of Eighth Street and University Place, New York.
The rear of the cabin merged into the cave. There the hermit cooked his meals on a
rude stone hearth. With infinite patience and an old axe he had chopped natural shelves in
the rocky walls. On them stood his stores of flour, bacon, lard, talcum-powder, kerosene,
baking- powder, soda-mint tablets, pepper, salt, and Olivo-Cremo Emulsion for chaps and
roughness of the hands and face.
The hermit had hermited there for ten years. He was an asset of the Viewpoint Inn. To
its guests he was second in interest only to the Mysterious Echo in the Haunted Glen. And
the Lover&rsquo;s Leap beat him only a few inches, flat-footed. He was known far (but not very
wide, on account of the topography) as a. scholar of brilliant intellect who had forsworn the
world because he had been jilted in a love affair. Every Saturday night the Viewpoint Inn
sent to him surreptitiously a basket of provisions. He never left the immediate outskirts of
his hermitage. Guests of the inn who visited him said his store of knowledge, wit, and
scintillating philosophy were simply wonderful, you know.
That summer the Viewpoint Inn was crowded with guests. So, on Saturday nights, there
were extra cans of tomatoes, and sirloin steak, instead of &ldquo;rounds,&rdquo; in the hermit&rsquo;s basket.
Now you have the material allegations in the case. So, make way for Romance.
Evidently the hermit expected a visitor. He carefully combed his long hair and parted his
apostolic beard. When the ninety-eight-cent alarm-clock on a stone shelf announced the
hour of five he picked up his gunny-sacking skirts, brushed them carefully, gathered an oaken
staff, and strolled slowly into the thick woods that surrounded the hermitage.
He had not long to wait. Up the faint pathway, slippery with its carpet of pine-needles,
toiled Beatrix, youngest and fairest of the famous Trenholme sisters. She was all in blue from
hat to canvas pumps, varying in tint from the shade of the tinkle of a bluebell at daybreak on
a spring Saturday to the deep hue of a Monday morning at nine when the washer-woman
has failed to show up.
Beatrix dug her cerulean parasol deep into the pine-needles and sighed. The hermit, on
the q. t., removed a grass burr from the ankle of one sandalled foot with the big toe of his
other one.She blued&ndash;and almost starched and ironed him&ndash;with her cobalt eyes.
&ldquo;It must be so nice,&rdquo; she said in little, tremulous gasps, &ldquo;to be a hermit, and have ladies
climb mountains to talk to you.&rdquo;
The hermit folded his arms and leaned against a tree. Beatrix, with a sigh, settled down
upon the mat of pine-needles like a bluebird upon her nest. The hermit followed suit;
drawing his feet rather awkwardly under his gunny-sacking.
&ldquo;It must be nice to be a mountain,&rdquo; said he, with ponderous lightness, &ldquo;and have angels
in blue climb up you instead of flying over you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mamma had neuralgia,&rdquo; said Beatrix, &ldquo;and went to bed, or I couldn&rsquo;t have come. It&rsquo;s
dreadfully hot at that horrid old inn. But we hadn&rsquo;t the money to go anywhere else this
summer.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;I climbed to the top of that big rock above us. I could see
the lights of the inn and hear a strain or two of the music when the wind was right. I
imagined you moving gracefully in the arms of others to the dreamy music of the waltz amid
the fragrance of flowers. Think how lonely I must have been!&rdquo;
The youngest, handsomest, and poorest of the famous Trenholme sisters sighed.
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t quite hit it,&rdquo; she said, plaintively. &ldquo;I was moving gracefully at the arms of
another. Mamma had one of her periodical attacks of rheumatism in both elbows and
shoulders, and I had to rub them for an hour with that horrid old liniment. I hope you didn&rsquo;t
think that smelled like flowers. You know, there were some West Point boys and a yachtload
of young men from the city at last evening&rsquo;s weekly dance. I&rsquo;ve known mamma to sit by an
open window for three hours with one-half of her registering 85 degrees and the other half
frostbitten, and never sneeze once. But just let a bunch of ineligibles come around where I
am, and she&rsquo;ll begin to swell at the knuckles and shriek with pain. And I have to take her to
her room and rub her arms. To see mamma dressed you&rsquo;d be surprised to know the number
of square inches of surface there are to her arms. I think it must be delightful to be a hermit.
That&ndash;cassock&ndash; gabardine, isn&rsquo;t it?&ndash;that you wear is so becoming. Do you make it&ndash;or
them&ndash;of course you must have changes- yourself? And what a blessed relief it must be to
wear sandals instead of shoes! Think how we must suffer&ndash;no matter how small I buy my
shoes they always pinch my toes. Oh, why can&rsquo;t there be lady hermits, too!&rdquo;
The beautifulest and most adolescent Trenholme sister extended two slender blue
ankles that ended in two enormous blue-silk bows that almost concealed two fairy Oxfords,
also of one of the forty-seven shades of blue. The hermit, as if impelled by a kind of reflextelepathic action, drew his bare toes farther beneath his gunny- sacking.&ldquo;I have heard about the romance of your life,&rdquo; said Miss Trenholme, softly. &ldquo;They have
it printed on the back of the menu card at the inn. Was she very beautiful and charming?&rdquo;
&ldquo;On the bills of fare!&rdquo; muttered the hermit; &ldquo;but what do I care for the world&rsquo;s babble?
Yes, she was of the highest and grandest type. Then,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;then I thought the
world could never contain another equal to her. So I forsook it and repaired to this mountain
fastness to spend the remainder of my life alone&ndash;to devote and dedicate my remaining
years to her memory.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s grand,&rdquo; said Miss Trenholme, &ldquo;absolutely grand. I think a hermit&rsquo;s life is the ideal
one. No bill-collectors calling, no dressing for dinner&ndash;how I&rsquo;d like to be one! But there&rsquo;s no
such luck for me. If I don&rsquo;t marry this season I honestly believe mamma will force me into
settlement work or trimming hats. It isn&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;m getting old or ugly; but we haven&rsquo;t
enough money left to butt in at any of the swell places any more. And I don&rsquo;t want to
marry&ndash;unless it&rsquo;s somebody I like. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;d like to be a hermit. Hermits don&rsquo;t ever
marry, do they ?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hundreds of &lsquo;em,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;when they&rsquo;ve found the right one.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re hermits,&rdquo; said the youngest and beautifulest, &ldquo;because they&rsquo;ve lost the
right one, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Because they think they have,&rdquo; answered the recluse, fatuously. &ldquo;Wisdom comes to
one in a mountain cave as well as to one in the world of &lsquo;swells,&rsquo; as I believe they are called
in the argot.&rdquo;
&ldquo;When one of the &lsquo;swells&rsquo; brings it to them,&rdquo; said Miss Trenholme. &ldquo;And my folks are
swells. That&rsquo;s the trouble. But there are so many swells at the seashore in the summer-time
that we hardly amount to more than ripples. So we&rsquo;ve had to put all our money into river
and harbor appropriations. We were all girls, you know. There were four of us. I&rsquo;m the only
surviving one. The others have been married off. All to money. Mamma is so proud of my
sisters. They send her the loveliest pen-wipers and art calendars every Christmas. I&rsquo;m the
only one on the market now. I&rsquo;m forbidden to look at any one who hasn&rsquo;t money.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But&ndash;&rdquo; began the hermit.
&ldquo;But, oh,&rdquo; said the beautifulest &ldquo;of course hermits have great pots of gold and
doubloons buried somewhere near three great oak-trees. They all have.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; said the hermit, regretfully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; said Miss Trenholme. &ldquo;I always thought they had. I think I must go now.&rdquo;
Oh, beyond question, she was the beautifulest.&ldquo;Fair lady&ndash;&rdquo; began the hermit.
&ldquo;I am Beatrix Trenholme&ndash;some call me Trix,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You must come to the inn to see
me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been a stone&rsquo;s&ndash;throw from my cave in ten years,&rdquo; said the hermit.
&ldquo;You must come to see me there,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Any evening except Thursday.&rdquo;
The hermit smiled weakly.
&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said, gathering the folds of her pale-blue skirt. &ldquo;I shall expect you. But
not on Thursday evening, remember.&rdquo;
What an interest it would give to the future menu cards of the Viewpoint Inn to have
these printed lines added to them: &ldquo;Only once during the more than ten years of his lonely
existence did the mountain hermit leave his famous cave. That was when he was irresistibly
drawn to the inn by the fascinations of Miss Beatrix Trenholme, youngest and most beautiful
of the celebrated Trenholme sisters, whose brilliant marriage to&ndash;&rdquo;
Aye, to whom?
The hermit walked back to the hermitage. At the door stood Bob Binkley, his old friend
and companion of the days before he had renounced the world&ndash;Bob, himself, arrayed like
the orchids of the greenhouse in the summer man&rsquo;s polychromatic garb&ndash;Bob, the
millionaire, with his fat, firm, smooth, shrewd face, his diamond rings, sparkling fob-chain,
and pleated bosom. He was two years older than the hermit, and looked five years younger.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Hamp Ellison, in spite of those whiskers and that going-away bathrobe,&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;I read about you on the bill of fare at the inn. They&rsquo;ve run your biography in
between the cheese and &lsquo;Not Responsible for Coats and Umbrellas.&rsquo; What &rsquo;d you do it for,
Hamp? And ten years, too&ndash;geewhilikins!&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just the same,&rdquo; said the hermit. &ldquo;Come in and sit down. Sit on that limestone
rock over there; it&rsquo;s softer than the granite.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it, old man,&rdquo; said Binkley. &ldquo;I can see how you could give up a woman
for ten years, but not ten years for a woman. Of course I know why you did it. Everybody
does. Edith Carr. She jilted four or five besides you. But you were the only one who took to a
hole in the ground. The others had recourse to whiskey, the Klondike, politics, and that
similia similibus cure. But, say&ndash;Hamp, Edith Carr was just about the finest woman in the
world&ndash;high-toned and proud and noble, and playing her ideals to win at all kinds of odds.
She certainly was a crackerjack.&ldquo;&ldquo;After I renounced the world,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;I never heard of her again.&rdquo;
&ldquo;She married me,&rdquo; said Binkley.
The hermit leaned against the wooden walls of his ante-cave and wriggled his toes.
&ldquo;I know how you feel about it,&rdquo; said Binkley. &ldquo;What else could she do? There were her
four sisters and her mother and old man Carr&ndash;you remember how he put all the money he
had into dirigible balloons? Well, everything was coming down and nothing going up with
&lsquo;em, as you might say. Well, I know Edith as well as you do&ndash;although I married her. I was
worth a million then, but I&rsquo;ve run it up since to between five and six. It wasn&rsquo;t me she
wanted as much as&ndash;well, it was about like this. She had that bunch on her hands, and they
had to be taken care of. Edith married me two months after you did the ground-squirrel act.
I thought she liked me, too, at the time.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And now?&rdquo; inquired the recluse.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re better friends than ever now. She got a divorce from me two years ago. Just
incompatibility. I didn&rsquo;t put in any defence. Well, well, well, Hamp, this is certainly a funny
dugout you&rsquo;ve built here. But you always were a hero of fiction. Seems like you&rsquo;d have been
the very one to strike Edith&rsquo;s fancy. Maybe you did&ndash;but it&rsquo;s the bank - roll that catches &lsquo;em,
my boy&ndash;your caves and whiskers won&rsquo;t do it. Honestly, Hamp, don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;ve been a
darned fool?&rdquo;
The hermit smiled behind his tangled beard. He was and always had been so superior
to the crude and mercenary Binkley that even his vulgarities could not anger him. Moreover,
his studies and meditations in his retreat had raised him far above the little vanities of the
world. His little mountain-side had been almost an Olympus, over the edge of which he saw,
smiling, the bolts hurled in the valleys of man below. Had his ten years of renunciation, of
thought, of devotion to an ideal, of living scorn of a sordid world, been in vain? Up from the
world had come to him the youngest and beautifulest&ndash;fairer than Edith&ndash;one and
three-seventh times lovelier than the seven-years-served Rachel. So the hermit smiled in his
beard.
When Binkley had relieved the hermitage from the blot of his presence and the first
faint star showed above the pines, the hermit got the can of baking-powder from his
cupboard. He still smiled behind his beard.
There was a slight rustle in the doorway. There stood Edith Carr, with all the added
beauty and stateliness and noble bearing that ten years had brought her.
She was never one to chatter. She looked at the hermit with her large, thinking, dark
eyes. The hermit stood still, surprised into a pose as motionless as her own. Only hissubconscious sense of the fitness of things caused him to turn the baking-powder can slowly
in his hands until its red label was hidden against his bosom.
&ldquo;I am stopping at the inn,&rdquo; said Edith, in low but clear tones. &ldquo;I heard of you there. I told
myself that I must see you. I want to ask your forgiveness. I sold my happiness for money.
There were others to be provided for&ndash;but that does not excuse me. I just wanted to see you
and ask your forgiveness. You have lived here ten years, they tell me, cherishing my memory!
I was blind, Hampton. I could not see then that all the money in the world cannot weigh in
the scales against a faithful heart. If&ndash;but it is too late now, of course.&rdquo;
Her assertion was a question clothed as best it could be in a loving woman&rsquo;s pride. But
through the thin disguise the hermit saw easily that his lady had come back to him&ndash;if he
chose. He had won a golden crown&ndash;if it pleased him to take it. The reward of his decade of
faithfulness was ready for his hand&ndash;if he desired to stretch it forth.
For the space of one minute the old enchantment shone upon him with a reflected
radiance. And then by turns he felt the manly sensations of indignation at having been
discarded, and of repugnance at having been&ndash;as it were&ndash;sought again. And last of all&ndash;how
strange that it should have come at last!&ndash;the pale-blue vision of the beautifulest of the
Trenholme sisters illuminated his mind&rsquo;s eye and left him without a waver.
&ldquo;It is too late,&rdquo; he said, in deep tones, pressing the baking-powder can against his heart.
Once she turned after she had gone slowly twenty yards down the path. The hermit
had begun to twist the lid off his can, but he hid it again under his sacking robe. He could see
her great eyes shining sadly through the twilight; but he stood inflexible in the doorway of
his shack and made no sign.
Just as the moon rose on Thursday evening the hermit was seized by the
world-madness.
Up from the inn, fainter than the horns of elf-land, came now and then a few bars of
music played by the casino band. The Hudson was broadened by the night into an illimitable
sea&ndash;those lights, dimly seen on its opposite shore, were not beacons for prosaic trolleylines, but low-set stars millions of miles away. The waters in front of the inn were gay with
fireflies&ndash;or were they motor-boats, smelling of gasoline and oil? Once the hermit had known
these things and had sported with Amaryllis in the shade of the red-and-white-striped
awnings. But for ten years he had turned a heedless ear to these far- off echoes of a
frivolous world. But to-night there was something wrong.
The casino band was playing a waltz&ndash;a waltz. What a fool he had been to tear
deliberately ten years of his life from the calendar of existence for one who had given him up
for the false joys that wealth- -&ldquo;tum ti tum ti tum ti&rdquo;&ndash;how did that waltz go? But those yearshad not been sacrificed&ndash;had they not brought him the star and pearl of all the world, the
youngest and beautifulest of&ndash;
&ldquo;But do not come on Thursday evening,&rdquo; she had insisted. Perhaps by now she would
be moving slowly and gracefully to the strains of that waltz, held closely by West-Pointers or
city commuters, while he, who had read in her eyes things that had recompensed him for
ten lost years of life, moped like some wild animal in its mountain den. Why should&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; said the hermit, suddenly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;
He threw down his Marcus Aurelius and threw off his gunny-sack toga. he dragged a
dust-covered trunk from a corner of the cave, and with difficulty wrenched open its lid.
Candles he had in plenty, and the cave was soon aglow. Clothes&ndash;ten years old in
cut&ndash;scissors, razors, hats, shoes, all his discarded attire and belongings, were dragged
ruthlessly from their renunciatory rest and strewn about in painful disorder.
A pair of scissors soon reduced his beard sufficiently for the dulled razors to perform
approximately their office. Cutting his own hair was beyond the hermit&rsquo;s skill. So he only
combed and brushed it backward as smoothly as he could. Charity forbids us to consider the
heartburnings and exertions of one so long removed from haberdashery and society.
At the last the hermit went to an inner corner of his cave and began to dig in the soft
earth with a long iron spoon. Out of the cavity he thus made he drew a tin can, and out of
the can three thousand dollars in bills, tightly rolled and wrapped in oiled silk. He was a real
hermit, as this may assure you.
You may take a brief look at him as he hastens down the little mountain-side. A long,
wrinkled black frock-coat reached to his calves. White duck trousers, unacquainted with the
tailor&rsquo;s goose, a pink shirt, white standing collar with brilliant blue butterfly tie, and
buttoned congress gaiters. But think, sir and madam&ndash;ten years! &gt;From beneath a
narrow-brimmed straw hat with a striped band flowed his hair. Seeing him, with all your
shrewdness you could not have guessed him. You would have said that he played Hamlet&ndash;or
the tuba&ndash;or pinochle&ndash;you would never have laid your hand on your heart and said: &ldquo;He is a
hermit who lived ten years in a cave for love of one lady&ndash;to win another.&rdquo;
The dancing pavilion extended above the waters of the river. Gay lanterns and frosted
electric globes shed a soft glamour within it. A hundred ladies and gentlemen from the inn
and summer cottages flitted in and about it. To the left of the dusty roadway down which
the hermit had tramped were the inn and grill-room. Something seemed to be on there, too.
The windows were brilliantly lighted, and music was playing&ndash;music different from the
two-steps and waltzes of the casino band.A negro man wearing a white jacket came through the iron gate, with its immense
granite posts and wrought-iron lamp-holders.
&ldquo;What is going on here to-night?&rdquo; asked the hermit.
&ldquo;Well, sah,&rdquo; said the servitor, &ldquo;dey is having de reg&rsquo;lar Thursday- evenin&rsquo; dance in de
casino. And in de grill-room dere&rsquo;s a beefsteak dinner, sah.&rdquo;
The hermit glanced up at the inn on the hillside whence burst suddenly a triumphant
strain of splendid harmony.
&ldquo;And up there,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they are playing Mendelssohn&ndash;what is going on up there?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Up in de inn,&rdquo; said the dusky one, &ldquo;dey is a weddin&rsquo; goin&rsquo; on. Mr. Binkley, a mighty rich
man, am marryin&rsquo; Miss Trenholme, sah&ndash;de young lady who am quite de belle of de place,
sah.&rdquo;
Tobin&rsquo;s Palm （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Tobin and me, the two of us, went down to Coney one day, for there was four dollars
between us, and Tobin had need of distractions. For there was Katie Mahorner, his
sweetheart, of County Sligo, lost since she started for America three months before with two
hundred dollars, her own savings, and one hundred dollars from the sale of Tobin&rsquo;s inherited
estate, a fine cottage and pig on the Bog Shannaugh. And since the letter that Tobin got
saying that she had started to come to him not a bit of news had he heard or seen of Katie
Mahorner. Tobin advertised in the papers, but nothing could be found of the colleen.
So, to Coney me and Tobin went, thinking that a turn at the chutes and the smell of the
popcorn might raise the heart in his bosom. But Tobin was a hardheaded man, and the
sadness stuck in his skin. He ground his teeth at the crying balloons; he cursed the moving
pictures; and, though he would drink whenever asked, he scorned Punch and Judy, and was
for licking the tintype men as they came.
So I gets him down a side way on a board walk where the attractions were some less
violent. At a little six by eight stall Tobin halts, with a more human look in his eye.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis here,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I will be diverted. I&rsquo;ll have the palm of me hand investigated by the
wonderful palmist of the Nile, and see if what is to be will be.&ldquo;Tobin was a believer in signs and the unnatural in nature. He possessed illegal
convictions in his mind along the subjects of black cats, lucky numbers, and the weather
predictions in the papers.
We went into the enchanted chicken coop, which was fixed mysterious with red cloth
and pictures of hands with lines crossing &lsquo;em like a railroad centre. The sign over the door
says it is Madame Zozo the Egyptian Palmist. There was a fat woman inside in a red jumper
with pothooks and beasties embroidered upon it. Tobin gives her ten cents and extends one
of his hands. She lifts Tohin&rsquo;s hand, which is own brother to the hoof of a drayhorse, and
examines it to see whether &lsquo;tis a stone in the frog or a cast shoe he has come for.
&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; says this Madame Zozo, &ldquo;the line of your fate shows&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tis not me foot at all,&rdquo; says Tobin, interrupting. &ldquo;Sure, &lsquo;tis no beauty, but ye hold the
palm of me hand.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The line shows,&rdquo; says the Madame, &ldquo;that ye&rsquo;ve not arrived at your time of life without
bad luck. And there&rsquo;s more to come. The mound of Venus&ndash;or is that a stone bruise?&ndash;shows
that ye&rsquo;ve been in love. There&rsquo;s been trouble in your life on account of your sweetheart.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis Katie Mahorner she has references with,&rdquo; whispers Tobin to me in a loud voice to
one side.
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; says the palmist, &ldquo;a great deal of sorrow and tribulation with one whom ye
cannot forget. I see the lines of designation point to the letter K and the letter M in her
name.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Whist!&rdquo; says Tobin to me, &ldquo;do ye hear that?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Look out,&rdquo; goes on the palmist, &ldquo;for a dark man and a light woman; for they&rsquo;ll both
bring ye trouble. Ye&rsquo;ll make a voyage upon the water very soon, and have a financial loss. I
see one line that brings good luck. There&rsquo;s a man coming into your life who will fetch ye
good fortune. Ye&rsquo;ll know him when ye see him by his crooked nose.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Is his name set down?&rdquo; asks Tobin. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twill be convenient in the way of greeting when
he backs up to dump off the good luck.&rdquo;
&ldquo;His name,&rdquo; says the palmist, thoughtful looking, &ldquo;is not spelled out by the lines, but
they indicate &lsquo;tis a long one, and the letter &lsquo;o&rsquo; should be in it. There&rsquo;s no more to tell.
Good-evening. Don&rsquo;t block up the door.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis wonderful how she knows,&rdquo; says Tobin as we walk to the pier.As we squeezed through the gates a nigger man sticks his lighted segar against Tobin&rsquo;s
ear, and there is trouble. Tobin hammers his neck, and the women squeal, and by presence
of mind I drag the little man out of the way before the police comes. Tobin is always in an
ugly mood when enjoying himself.
On the boat going back, when the man calls &ldquo;Who wants the good- looking waiter?&rdquo;
Tobin tried to plead guilty, feeling the desire to blow the foam off a crock of suds, but when
he felt in his pocket he found himself discharged for lack of evidence. Somebody had
disturbed his change during the commotion. So we sat, dry, upon the stools, listening to the
Dagoes fiddling on deck. If anything, Tobin was lower in spirits and less congenial with his
misfortunes than when we started.
On a seat against the railing was a young woman dressed suitable for red automobiles,
with hair the colour of an unsmoked meerschaum. In passing by, Tobin kicks her foot
without intentions, and, being polite to ladies when in drink, he tries to give his hat a twist
while apologising. But he knocks it off, and the wind carries it overboard.
Tobin came back and sat down, and I began to look out for him, for the man&rsquo;s
adversities were becoming frequent. He was apt, when pushed so close by hard luck, to kick
the best dressed man he could see, and try to take command of the boat.
Presently Tobin grabs my arm and says, excited: &ldquo;Jawn,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;do ye know what
we&rsquo;re doing? We&rsquo;re taking a voyage upon the water.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;subdue yeself. The boat&rsquo;l1 land in ten minutes more.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;at the light lady upon the bench. And have ye forgotten the nigger
man that burned me ear? And isn&rsquo;t the money I had gone&ndash;a dollar sixty-five it was?&rdquo;
I thought he was no more than summing up his catastrophes so as to get violent with
good excuse, as men will do, and I tried to make him understand such things was trifles.
&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; says Tobin. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve no ear for the gift of prophecy or the miracles of the inspired.
What did the palmist lady tell ye out of me hand? &lsquo;Tis coming true before your eyes. &lsquo;Look
out,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;for a dark man and a light woman; they&rsquo;ll bring ye trouble.&rsquo; Have ye forgot
the nigger man, though be got some of it back from me fist? Can ye show me a lighter
woman than the blonde lady that was the cause of me hat falling in the water? And where&rsquo;s
the dollar sixty- five I had in me vest when we left the shooting gallery?&rdquo;
The way Tobin put it,it did seem to corroborate the art of prediction, though it looked
to me that these accidents could happen to any one at Coney without the implication of
palmistry.Tobin got up and walked around on deck, looking close at the passengers out of his
little red eyes. I asked him the interpretation of his movements. Ye never know what Tobin
has in his mind until he begins to carry it out.
&ldquo;Ye should know,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working out the salvation promised by the lines in me
palm. I&rsquo;m looking for the crooked-nose man that&rsquo;s to bring the good luck. &lsquo;Tis all that will
save us. Jawn, did ye ever see a straighter-nosed gang of hellions in the days of your life?&rdquo;
&lsquo;Twas the nine-thirty boat, and we landed and walked up-town through Twenty-second
Street, Tobin being without his hat.
On a street corner, standing under a gas-light and looking over the elevated road at the
moon, was a man. A long man he was, dressed decent, with a segar between his teeth, and I
saw that his nose made two twists from bridge to end, like the wriggle of a snake. Tobin saw
it at the same time, and I heard him breathe hard like a horse when you take the saddle off.
He went straight up to the man, and I went with him.
&ldquo;Good-night to ye,&rdquo; Tobin says to the man. The man takes out his segar and passes the
compliments, sociable.
&ldquo;Would ye hand us your name,&rdquo; asks Tobin, &ldquo;and let us look at the size of it? It may be
our duty to become acquainted with ye.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My name&rdquo; says the man, polite, &ldquo;is Friedenhausman&ndash;Maximus G. Friedenhausman.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the right length,&rdquo; says Tobin. &ldquo;Do you spell it with an &lsquo;o&rsquo; anywhere down the
stretch of it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; says the man.
&ldquo;Can ye spell it with an &lsquo;o&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquires Tobin, turning anxious.
&ldquo;If your conscience,&rdquo; says the man with the nose, &ldquo;is indisposed toward foreign idioms
ye might, to please yourself, smuggle the letter into the penultimate syllable.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis well,&rdquo; says Tobin. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re in the presence of Jawn Malone and Daniel Tobin.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tis highly appreciated,&rdquo; says the man, with a bow. &ldquo;And now since I cannot conceive
that ye would hold a spelling bee upon the street corner, will ye name some reasonable
excuse for being at large?&rdquo;
&ldquo;By the two signs,&rdquo; answers Tobin, trying to explain, &ldquo;which ye display according to the
reading of the Egyptian palmist from the sole of me hand, ye&rsquo;ve been nominated to offset
with good luck the lines of trouble leading to the nigger man and the blonde lady with herfeet crossed in the boat, besides the financial loss of a dollar sixty-five, all so far fulfilled
according to Hoyle.&rdquo;
The man stopped smoking and looked at me.
&ldquo;Have ye any amendments,&rdquo; he asks, &ldquo;to offer to that statement, or are ye one too? I
thought by the looks of ye ye might have him in charge.&rdquo;
&ldquo;None,&rdquo; says I to him, &ldquo;except that as one horseshoe resembles another so are ye the
picture of good luck as predicted by the hand of me friend. If not, then the lines of Danny&rsquo;s
hand may have been crossed, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s two of ye,&rdquo; says the man with the nose, looking up and down for the sight of a
policeman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed your company immense. Good-night.&rdquo;
With that he shoves his segar in his mouth and moves across the street, stepping fast.
But Tobin sticks close to one side of him and me at the other.
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; says he, stopping on the opposite sidewalk and pushing back his hat; &ldquo;do ye
follow me? I tell ye,&rdquo; he says, very loud, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to have met ye. But it is my desire to be
rid of ye. I am off to me home.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; says Tobin, leaning against his sleeve. &ldquo;Do be off to your home. And I will sit at
the door of it till ye come out in the morning. For the dependence is upon ye to obviate the
curse of the nigger man and the blonde lady and the financial loss of the one-sixty-five.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a strange hallucination,&rdquo; says the man, turning to me as a more reasonable lunatic.
&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t ye better get him home?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Listen, man,&rdquo; says I to him. &ldquo;Daniel Tobin is as sensible as he ever was. Maybe he is a
bit deranged on account of having drink enough to disturb but not enough to settle his wits,
but he is no more than following out the legitimate path of his superstitions and
predicaments, which I will explain to you.&rdquo; With that I relates the facts about the palmist
lady and how the finger of suspicion points to him as an instrument of good fortune. &ldquo;Now,
understand,&rdquo; I concludes, &ldquo;my position in this riot. I am the friend of me friend Tobin,
according to me interpretations. &lsquo;Tis easy to be a friend to the prosperous, for it pays; &lsquo;tis
not hard to be a friend to the poor, for ye get puffed up by gratitude and have your picture
printed standing in front of a tenement with a scuttle of coal and an orphan in each hand.
But it strains the art of friendship to be true friend to a born fool. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m
doing,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;for, in my opinion, there&rsquo;s no fortune to be read from the palm of me hand
that wasn&rsquo;t printed there with the handle of a pick. And, though ye&rsquo;ve got the crookedest
nose in New York City, I misdoubt that all the fortune-tellers doing business could milk good
luck from ye. But the lines of Danny&rsquo;s hand pointed to ye fair, and I&rsquo;ll assist him to
experiment with ye until he&rsquo;s convinced ye&rsquo;re dry.&ldquo;After that the man turns, sudden, to laughing. He leans against a corner and laughs
considerable. Then he claps me and Tobin on the backs of us and takes us by an arm apiece.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis my mistake,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;How could I be expecting anything so fine and wonderful to
be turning the corner upon me? I came near being found unworthy. Hard by,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is a
cafe, snug and suitable for the entertainment of idiosyncrasies. Let us go there and have
drink while we discuss the unavailability of the categorical.&rdquo;
So saying, he marched me and Tobin to the back room of a saloon, and ordered the
drinks, and laid the money on the table. He looks at me and Tobin like brothers of his, and
we have the segars.
&ldquo;Ye must know,&rdquo; says the man of destiny, &ldquo;that me walk in life is one that is called the
literary. I wander abroad be night seeking idiosyncrasies in the masses and truth in the
heavens above. When ye came upon me I was in contemplation of the elevated road in
conjunction with the chief luminary of night. The rapid transit is poetry and art: the moon
but a tedious, dry body, moving by rote. But these are private opinions, for, in the business
of literature, the conditions are reversed. &lsquo;Tis me hope to be writing a book to explain the
strange things I have discovered in life.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ye will put me in a book,&rdquo; says Tobin, disgusted; &ldquo;will ye put me in a book?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; says the man, &ldquo;for the covers will not hold ye. Not yet. The best I can do is
to enjoy ye meself, for the time is not ripe for destroying the limitations of print. Ye would
look fantastic in type. All alone by meself must I drink this cup of joy. But, I thank ye, boys; I
am truly grateful.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The talk of ye,&rdquo; says Tobin, blowing through his moustache and pounding the table
with his fist, &ldquo;is an eyesore to me patience. There was good luck promised out of the crook
of your nose, but ye bear fruit like the bang of a drum. Ye resemble, with your noise of books,
the wind blowing through a crack. Sure, now, I would be thinking the palm of me hand lied
but for the coming true of the nigger man and the blonde lady and&ndash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Whist!&rdquo; says the long man; &ldquo;would ye be led astray by physiognomy? Me nose will do
what it can within bounds. Let us have these glasses filled again, for &lsquo;tis good to keep
idiosyncrasies well moistened, they being subject to deterioration in a dry moral
atmosphere.&rdquo;
So, the man of literature makes good, to my notion, for he pays, cheerful, for
everything, the capital of me and Tobin being exhausted by prediction. But Tobin is sore, and
drinks quiet, with the red showing in his eye.By and by we moved out, for &lsquo;twas eleven o&rsquo;clock, and stands a bit upon the sidewalk.
And then the man says he must be going home, and invites me and Tobin to walk that way.
We arrives on a side street two blocks away where there is a stretch of brick houses with
high stoops and iron fences. The man stops at one of them and looks up at the top windows
which he finds dark.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis me humble dwelling,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and I begin to perceive by the signs that me wife
has retired to slumber. Therefore I will venture a bit in the way of hospitality. &lsquo;Tis me wish
that ye enter the basement room, where we dine, and partake of a reasonable refreshment.
There will be some fine cold fowl and cheese and a bottle or two of ale. Ye will be welcome
to enter and eat, for I am indebted to ye for diversions.&rdquo;
The appetite and conscience of me and Tobin was congenial to the proposition, though
&lsquo;twas sticking hard in Danny&rsquo;s superstitions to think that a few drinks and a cold lunch should
represent the good fortune promised by the palm of his hand.
&ldquo;Step down the steps,&rdquo; says the man with the crooked nose, &ldquo;and I will enter by the
door above and let ye in. I will ask the new girl we have in the kitchen,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to make ye
a pot of coffee to drink before ye go. &lsquo;Tis fine coffee Katie Mahorner makes for a green girl
just landed three months. Step in,&rdquo; says the man, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll send her down to ye.&rdquo;
Tommy&rsquo;s Burglar （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>AT TEN o&rsquo;clock P. M. Felicia, the maid, left by the basement door with the policeman to
get a raspberry phosphate around the corner. She detested the police- man and objected
earnestly to the arrangement. She pointed out, not unreasonably, that she might have been
allowed to fall asleep over one of St. George Rathbone&rsquo;s novels on the third floor, but she
was overruled. Rasp- berries and cops were not created for nothing.
The burglar got into the house without much difficulty; because we must have action
and not too much descrip- tion in a 2,000-word story.
In the dining room he opened the slide of his dark lantern. With a brace and centrebit
he began to bore into the lock of the silver-closet.
Suddenly a click was heard. The room was flooded with electric light. The dark velvet
portières parted to admit a fair-haired boy of eight in pink pajamas, bearing a bottle of olive
oil in his hand.
&ldquo;Are you a burglar?&rdquo; he asked, in a sweet, childish voice.&ldquo;Listen to that,&rdquo; exclaimed the man, in a hoarse voice. &ldquo;Am I a burglar? Wot do you
suppose I have a three- days&rsquo; growth of bristly bread on my face for, and a cap with flaps?
Give me the oil, quick, and let me grease the bit, so I won&rsquo;t wake up your mamma, who is
lying down with a headache, and left you in charge of Felicia. who has been faithless to her
trust.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; said Tommy, with a sigh. &ldquo;I thought you would be more up-to-date. This oil
is for the salad when I bring lunch from the pantry for you. And mamma and papa have gone
to the Metropolitan to hear De Reszke. But that isn&rsquo;t my fault. It only shows how long the
story has been knocking around among the editors. If the author had been wise he&rsquo;d have
changed it to Caruso in the proofs.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; hissed the burglar, under his breath. &ldquo;If you raise an alarm I&rsquo;ll wring your
neck like a rabbit&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Like a chicken&rsquo;s,&rdquo; corrected Tommy. &ldquo;You had that wrong. You don&rsquo;t wring rabbits&rsquo;
necks.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of me?&rdquo; asked the burglar.
&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; answered Tommy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose I know fact from fiction. If
this wasn&rsquo;t a story I&rsquo;d yell like an Indian when I saw you; and you&rsquo;d probably tumble
downstairs and get pinched on the sidewalk.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the burglar, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re on to your job. Go on with the performance.&rdquo;
Tommy seated himself in an armchair and drew his toes up under him.
&ldquo;Why do you go around robbing strangers, Mr. Burg- lar? Have you no friends?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I see what you&rsquo;re driving at,&rdquo; said the burglar, with a dark frown. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same old
story. Your innocence and childish insouciance is going to lead me back into an honest life.
Every time I crack a crib where there&rsquo;s a kid around, it happens.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Would you mind gazing with wolfish eyes at the plate of cold beef that the butler has
left on the dining table?&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s growing late.&rdquo;
The burglar accommodated.
&ldquo;Poor man,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;You must be hungry. If you will please stand in a listless
attitude I will get you something to eat.&ldquo;The boy brought a roast chicken, a jar of marmalade and a bottle of wine from the
pantry. The burglar seized a knife and fork sullenly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been an hour,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;since I had a lobster and a pint of musty ale up
on Broadway. I wish these story writers would let a fellow have a pepsin tablet, anyhow,
between feeds.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My papa writes books,&rdquo; remarked Tommy.
The burglar jumped to his feet quickly.
&ldquo;You said he had gone to the opera,&rdquo; he hissed, hoarsely and with immediate suspicion.
&ldquo;I ought to have explained,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t buy the tickets.&rdquo; The burglar sat
again and toyed with the wishbone.
&ldquo;Why do you burgle houses?&rdquo; asked the boy, wonderingly.
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied the burglar, with a sudden flow of tears. &ldquo;God bless my little
brown-baired boy Bessie at home.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Tommy, wrinkling his nose, &ldquo;you got that answer in the wrong place. You
want to tell your hard- luck story before you pull out the child stop.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the burglar, &ldquo;I forgot. Well, once I lived in Milwaukee, and &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Take the silver,&rdquo; said Tommy, rising from his chair.
&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said the burglar. &ldquo;But I moved away.&rdquo; I could find no other employment. For
a while I man- aged to support my wife and child by passing confederate money; but, alas! I
was forced to give that up because it did not belong to the union. I became desperate and a
burglar.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Have you ever fallen into the hands of the police?&rdquo; asked Tommy.
&ldquo;I said &lsquo;burglar,&rsquo; not &lsquo;beggar,&rsquo;&rdquo; answered the cracksman.
&ldquo;After you finish your lunch,&rdquo; said Tommy, &ldquo;and experience the usual change Of heart,
how shall we wind up the story?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said the burglar, thoughtfully, &ldquo;that Tony Pastor turns out earlier than usual
to-night, and your father gets in from &lsquo;Parsifal&rsquo; at 10.30. I am thoroughly repentant because
you have made me think of my own little boy Bessie, and &ndash; &ldquo;&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Tommy, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you got that wrong?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not on your coloured crayon drawings by B. Cory Kilvert,&rdquo; said the burglar. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always
a Bessie that I have at home, artlessly prattling to the pale-checked burglar&rsquo;s bride. As I was
saying, your father opens the front door just as I am departing with admonitions and
sandwiches that you have wrapped up for me. Upon recognizing me as an old Harvard
classmate he starts back in &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Not in surprise?&rdquo; interrupted Tommy, with wide, open eyes.
&ldquo;He starts back in the doorway,&rdquo; continued the burglar. And then he rose to his feet and
began to shout &ldquo;Rah, rah, rah! rah, rah, rah! rah, rah, rah!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tommy, wonderingly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s, the first time I ever knew a burglar to give a
college yell when he was burglarizing a house, even in a story.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one on you,&rdquo; said the burglar, with a laugh. &ldquo;I was practising the dramatization.
If this is put on the stage that college touch is about the only thing that will make it go.&rdquo;
Tommy looked his admiration.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on, all right,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another mistalze you&rsquo;ve made,&rdquo; said the burglar. &ldquo;You should have gone
some time ago and brought me the $9 gold piece your mother gave you on your birthday to
take to Bessie.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t give it to me to take to Bessie,&rdquo; said Tommy, pouting.
&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said the burglar, sternly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not nice of you to take advantage because
the story contains an ambiguous sentence. You know what I mean. It&rsquo;s mighty little I get out
of these fictional jobs, anyhow. I lose all the loot, and I have to reform every time; and all the
swag I&rsquo;m allowed is the blamed little fol-de-rols and luck-pieces that you kids hand over. Why,
in one story, all I got was a kiss from a little girl who came in on me when I was opening a
safe. And it tasted of molasses candy, too. I&rsquo;ve a good notion to tie this table cover over your
head and keep on into the silver-closet.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, no, you haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tommy, wrapping his arms around his knees. &ldquo;Because if
you did no editor would buy the story. You know you&rsquo;ve got to preserve the unities.&rdquo;
&ldquo;So&rsquo;ve you,&rdquo; said the burglar, rather glumly. &ldquo;Instead of sitting here talking impudence
and taking the bread out of a poor man&rsquo;s mouth, what you&rsquo;d like to be doing is hiding under
the bed and screeching at the top of your voice.&ldquo;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, old man,&rdquo; said Tommy, heartily. &ldquo;I wonder what they make us do it for? I
think the S. P. C. C. ought to interfere. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s neither agreeable nor usual for a kid of my
age to butt in when a full-grown burglar is at work and offer him a red sled and a pair of
skates not to awaken his sick mother. And look how they make the burglars act! You&rsquo;d think
editors would know &ndash; but what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;
The burglar wiped his hands on the tablecloth and arose with a yawn.
&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get through with it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;God bless you, my little boy! you have saved a
man from committing a crime this night. Bessie shall pray for you as soon as I get home and
give her her orders. I shall never burglarize another house &ndash; at least not until the June
magazines are out. It&rsquo;ll be your little sister&rsquo;s turn then to run in on me while I am abstracting
the U. S. 4 per cent. from the tea urn and buy me off with her coral necklace and a falsetto
kiss.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got all the kicks coming to you,&rdquo; sighed Tommy, crawling out of his chair.
&ldquo;Think of the sleep I&rsquo;m losing. But it&rsquo;s tough on both of us, old man. I wish you could get out
of the story and really rob somebody. Maybe you&rsquo;ll have the chance if they dramatize us.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said the burglar, gloomily. &ldquo;Between the box office and my better impulses
that your leading juven- iles are supposed to awaken and the magazines that pay on
publication, I guess I&rsquo;ll always be broke.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Tommy, sympathetically. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t help myself any more than you
can. It&rsquo;s one of the canons of household fiction that no burglar shall be suc- cessful. The
burglar must be foiled by a kid like me, or- by a young lady heroine, or at the last moment by
his old pal, Red Mike, who recognizes the house as one in which he used to be the coachman.
You have got the worst end of it in any kind of a story.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, I suppose I must be clearing out now,&rdquo; said the burglar, taking up his lantern and
bracebit.
&ldquo;You have to take the rest of this chicken and the bottle of wine with you for Bessie and
her mother,&rdquo; said Tommy, calmly.
&ldquo;But confound it,&rdquo; exclaimed the burglar, in an annoyed tone, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t want it. I&rsquo;ve
got five cases of Chateau de Beychsvelle at home that was bottled in 1853. That claret of
yours is corked. And you couldn&rsquo;t get either of them to look at a chicken unless it was stewed
in champagne. You know, after I get out of the story I don&rsquo;t have so many limitations. I make
a turn now and then.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, but you must take them,&rdquo; said Tommy, loading his arms with the bundles.&ldquo;Bless you, young master!&rdquo; recited the burglar, obedient. &ldquo;Second-Story Saul will never
forget you. And now hurry and let me out, kid. Our 2,000 words must be nearly up.&rdquo;
Tommy led the way through the hall toward the front door. Suddenly the burglar
stopped and called to him softly: &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t there a cop out there in front somewhere sparking
the girl?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tommy, &ldquo;but what &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll catch me,&rdquo; said the burglar. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t forget that this is fiction.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Great head!&rdquo; said Tommy, turning. &ldquo;Come out by the back door.&rdquo;
An Unfinished Story （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>We no longer groan and heap ashes upon our heads when the flames of Tophet are
mentioned. For, even the preachers have begun to tell us that God is radium, or ether or
some scientific compound, and that the worst we wicked ones may expect is a chemical
reaction. This is a pleasing hypothesis; but there lingers yet some of the old, goodly terror of
orthodoxy.
There are but two subjects upon which one may discourse with a free imagination, and
without the possibility of being controverted. You may talk of your dreams; and you may tell
what you heard a parrot say. Both Morpheus and the bird are incompetent witnesses; and
your listener dare not attack your recital. The baseless fabric of a vision, then, shall furnish
my theme&ndash;chosen with apologies and regrets instead of the more limited field of pretty
Polly&rsquo;s small talk.
I had a dream that was so far removed from the higher criticism that it had to do with
the ancient, respectable, and lamented bar-of- judgment theory.
Gabriel had played his trump; and those of us who could not follow suit were arraigned
for examination. I noticed at one side a gathering of professional bondsmen in solemn black
and collars that buttoned behind; but it seemed there was some trouble about their real
estate titles; and they did not appear to be getting any of us out.
A fly cop&ndash;an angel policeman&ndash;flew over to me and took me by the left wing. Near at
hand was a group of very prosperous-looking spirits arraigned for judgment.&ldquo;Do you belong with that bunch?&rdquo; the policeman asked.
&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; was my answer.
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they are&ndash;&rdquo;
But this irrelevant stuff is taking up space that the story should occupy.
Dulcie worked in a department store. She sold Hamburg edging, or stuffed peppers, or
automobiles, or other little trinkets such as they keep in department stores. Of what she
earned, Dulcie received six dollars per week. The remainder was credited to her and debited
to somebody else&rsquo;s account in the ledger kept by G&ndash; Oh, primal energy, you say, Reverend
Doctor&ndash;Well then, in the Ledger of Primal Energy.
During her first year in the store, Dulcie was paid five dollars per week. It would be
instructive to know how she lived on that amount. Don&rsquo;t care? Very well; probably you are
interested in larger amounts. Six dollars is a larger amount. I will tell you how she lived on six
dollars per week.
One afternoon at six, when Dulcie was sticking her hat-pin within an eighth of an inch
of her medulla oblongata, she said to her chum, Sadie&ndash;the girl that waits on you with her
left side:
&ldquo;Say, Sade, I made a date for dinner this evening with Piggy.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You never did!&rdquo; exclaimed Sadie admiringly. &ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t you the lucky one? Piggy&rsquo;s an
awful swell; and he always takes a girl to swell places. He took Blanche up to the Hoffman
House one evening, where they have swell music, and you see a lot of swells. You&rsquo;ll have a
swell time, Dulce.&rdquo;
Dulcie hurried homeward. Her eyes were shining, and her cheeks showed the delicate
pink of life&rsquo;s&ndash;real life&rsquo;s&ndash;approaching dawn. It was Friday; and she had fifty cents left of her
last week&rsquo;s wages.
The streets were filled with the rush-hour floods of people. The electric lights of
Broadway were glowing&ndash;calling moths from miles, from leagues, from hundreds of leagues
out of darkness around to come in and attend the singeing school. Men in accurate clothes,
with faces like those carved on cherry stones by the old salts in sailors&rsquo; homes, turned and
stared at Dulcie as she sped, unheeding, past them. Manhattan, the night-blooming cereus,
was beginning to unfold its dead-white, heavy-odoured petals.
Dulcie stopped in a store where goods were cheap and bought an imitation lace collar
with her fifty cents. That money was to have been spent otherwise&ndash;fifteen cents for supper,
ten cents for breakfast, ten cents for lunch. Another dime was to be added to her small storeof savings; and five cents was to be squandered for licorice drops&ndash;the kind that made your
cheek look like the toothache, and last as long. The licorice was an extravagance&ndash; almost a
carouse&ndash;but what is life without pleasures?
Dulcie lived in a furnished room. There is this difference between a furnished room and
a boardinghouse. In a furnished room, other people do not know it when you go hungry.
Dulcie went up to her room&ndash;the third floor back in a West Side brownstone-front. She
lit the gas. Scientists tell us that the diamond is the hardest substance known. Their mistake.
Landladies know of a compound beside which the diamond is as putty. They pack it in the
tips of gas-burners; and one may stand on a chair and dig at it in vain until one&rsquo;s fingers are
pink and bruised. A hairpin will not remove it; therefore let us call it immovable.
So Dulcie lit the gas. In its one-fourth-candlepower glow we will observe the room.
Couch-bed, dresser, table, washstand, chair&ndash;of this much the landlady was guilty. The
rest was Dulcie&rsquo;s. On the dresser were her treasures&ndash;a gilt china vase presented to her by
Sadie, a calendar issued by a pickle works, a book on the divination of dreams, some rice
powder in a glass dish, and a cluster of artificial cherries tied with a pink ribbon.
Against the wrinkly mirror stood pictures of General Kitchener, William Muldoon, the
Duchess of Marlborough, and Benvenuto Cellini. Against one wall was a plaster of Paris
plaque of an O&rsquo;Callahan in a Roman helmet. Near it was a violent oleograph of a
lemon-coloured child assaulting an inflammatory butterfly. This was Dulcie&rsquo;s final judgment
in art; but it had never been upset. Her rest had never been disturbed by whispers of stolen
copes; no critic had elevated his eyebrows at her infantile entomologist.
Piggy was to call for her at seven. While she swiftly makes ready, let us discreetly face
the other way and gossip.
For the room, Dulcie paid two dollars per week. On week-days her breakfast cost ten
cents; she made coffee and cooked an egg over the gaslight while she was dressing. On
Sunday mornings she feasted royally on veal chops and pineapple fritters at &ldquo;Billy&rsquo;s&rdquo;
restaurant, at a cost of twenty-five cents&ndash;and tipped the waitress ten cents. New York
presents so many temptations for one to run into extravagance. She had her lunches in the
department-store restaurant at a cost of sixty cents for the week; dinners were $1.05. The
evening papers&ndash;show me a New Yorker going without his daily paper! &ndash;came to six cents;
and two Sunday papers&ndash;one for the personal column and the other to read&ndash;were ten cents.
The total amounts to $4.76. Now, one has to buy clothes, and&ndash;
I give it up. I hear of wonderful bargains in fabrics, and of miracles performed with
needle and thread; but I am in doubt. I hold my pen poised in vain when I would add to
Dulcie&rsquo;s life some of those joys that belong to woman by virtue of all the unwritten, sacred,
natural, inactive ordinances of the equity of heaven. Twice she had been to Coney Island andhad ridden the hobby-horses. &lsquo;Tis a weary thing to count your pleasures by summers instead
of by hours.
Piggy needs but a word. When the girls named him, an undeserving stigma was cast
upon the noble family of swine. The words-of-three- letters lesson in the old blue spelling
book begins with Piggy&rsquo;s biography. He was fat; he had the soul of a rat, the habits of a bat,
and the magnanimity of a cat&hellip; He wore expensive clothes; and was a connoisseur in
starvation. He could look at a shop-girl and tell you to an hour how long it had been since
she had eaten anything more nourishing than marshmallows and tea. He hung about the
shopping districts, and prowled around in department stores with his invitations to dinner.
Men who escort dogs upon the streets at the end of a string look down upon him. He is a
type; I can dwell upon him no longer; my pen is not the kind intended for him; I am no
carpenter.
At ten minutes to seven Dulcie was ready. She looked at herself in the wrinkly mirror.
The reflection was satisfactory. The dark blue dress, fitting without a wrinkle, the hat with its
jaunty black feather, the but-slightly-soiled gloves&ndash;all representing self- denial, even of food
itself&ndash;were vastly becoming.
Dulcie forgot everything else for a moment except that she was beautiful, and that life
was about to lift a corner of its mysterious veil for her to observe its wonders. No gentleman
had ever asked her out before. Now she was going for a brief moment into the glitter and
exalted show.
The girls said that Piggy was a &ldquo;spender.&rdquo; There would be a grand dinner, and music,
and splendidly dressed ladies to look at, and things to eat that strangely twisted the girls&rsquo;
jaws when they tried to tell about them. No doubt she would be asked out again. There was
a blue pongee suit in a window that she knew&ndash;by saving twenty cents a week instead of ten,
in&ndash;let&rsquo;s see&ndash;Oh, it would run into years! But there was a second-hand store in Seventh
Avenue where&ndash;
Somebody knocked at the door. Dulcie opened it. The landlady stood there with a
spurious smile, sniffing for cooking by stolen gas.
&ldquo;A gentleman&rsquo;s downstairs to see you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Name is Mr. Wiggins.&rdquo;
By such epithet was Piggy known to unfortunate ones who had to take him seriously.
Dulcie turned to the dresser to get her handkerchief; and then she stopped still, and bit
her underlip hard. While looking in her mirror she had seen fairyland and herself, a princess,
just awakening from a long slumber. She had forgotten one that was watching her with sad,
beautiful, stern eyes&ndash;the only one there was to approve or condemn what she did. Straight
and slender and tall, with a look of sorrowful reproach on his handsome, melancholy face,General Kitchener fixed his wonderful eyes on her out of his gilt photograph frame on the
dresser.
Dulcie turned like an automatic doll to the landlady.
&ldquo;Tell him I can&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; she said dully. &ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;m sick, or something. Tell him I&rsquo;m not
going out.&rdquo;
After the door was closed and locked, Dulcie fell upon her bed, crushing her black tip,
and cried for ten minutes. General Kitchener was her only friend. He was Dulcie&rsquo;s ideal of a
gallant knight. He looked as if he might have a secret sorrow, and his wonderful moustache
was a dream, and she was a little afraid of that stern yet tender look in his eyes. She used to
have little fancies that he would call at the house sometime, and ask for her, with his sword
clanking against his high boots. Once, when a boy was rattling a piece of chain against a
lamp-post she had opened the window and looked out. But there was no use. She knew that
General Kitchener was away over in Japan, leading his army against the savage Turks; and he
would never step out of his gilt frame for her. Yet one look from him had vanquished Piggy
that night. Yes, for that night.
When her cry was over Dulcie got up and took off her best dress, and put on her old
blue kimono. She wanted no dinner. She sang two verses of &ldquo;Sammy.&rdquo; Then she became
intensely interested in a little red speck on the side of her nose. And after that was attended
to, she drew up a chair to the rickety table, and told her fortune with an old deck of cards.
&ldquo;The horrid, impudent thing!&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;And I never gave him a word or a look to
make him think it!&rdquo;
At nine o&rsquo;clock Dulcie took a tin box of crackers and a little pot of raspberry jam out of
her trunk, and had a feast. She offered General Kitchener some jam on a cracker; but he only
looked at her as the sphinx would have looked at a butterfly&ndash;if there are butterflies in the
desert.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat it if you don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; said Dulcie. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t put on so many airs and scold
so with your eyes. I wonder if you&rsquo;d he so superior and snippy if you had to live on six dollars
a week.&rdquo;
It was not a good sign for Dulcie to be rude to General Kitchener. And then she turned
Benvenuto Cellini face downward with a severe gesture. But that was not inexcusable; for
she had always thought he was Henry VIII, and she did not approve of him.
At half-past nine Dulcie took a last look at the pictures on the dresser, turned out the
light, and skipped into bed. It&rsquo;s an awful thing to go to bed with a good-night look at General
Kitchener, William Muldoon, the Duchess of Marlborough, and Benvenuto Cellini. This story
really doesn&rsquo;t get anywhere at all. The rest of it comes later&ndash;sometime when Piggy asksDulcie again to dine with him, and she is feeling lonelier than usual, and General Kitchener
happens to be looking the other way; and then&ndash;
As I said before, I dreamed that I was standing near a crowd of prosperous-looking
angels, and a policeman took me by the wing and asked if I belonged with them.
&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they are the men who hired working-girls, and paid &lsquo;em five or six
dollars a week to live on. Are you one of the bunch?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not on your immortality,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only the fellow that set fire to an orphan asylum,
and murdered a blind man for his pennies.&rdquo;
The Unknown Quantity （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>The poet Longfellow - or was it Confucius, the inventor of wisdom? - remarked:
&ldquo;Life is real, life is earnest; And things are not what they seem.&rdquo;
As mathematics are - or is: thanks, old subscriber! - the only just rule by which
questions of life can be measured, let us, by all means, adjust our theme to the straight edge
and the balanced column of the great goddess Two-and-Two-Makes-Four. Figures -
unassailable sums in addition - shall be set over against whatever oposing element there
may be.
A mathematician, after scanning the above two lines of poetry, would say: &ldquo;Ahem!
young gentlemen, if we assume that X plus - that is, that life is real - then things (all of which
life includes) are real. Anything that is real is what it seems. Then if we consider the
proposition that &lsquo;things are not what they seem,&rsquo; why -&rdquo;
But this is heresy, and not poesy. We woo the sweet nymph Algebra; we would conduct
you into the presence of the elusive, seductive, pursued, satisfying, mysterious X.
Not long before the beginning of this century, Septimus Kinsolving, an old New Yorker,
invented an idea. He originated the discovery that bread is made from flour and not from
wheat futures. Perceiving that the flour crop was short, and that the Stock Exchange was
having no perceptible effect on the growing wheat, Mr. Kinsolving cornered the flour
market.The result was that when you or my landlady (before the war she never had to turn her
hand to anything; Southerners accomodated) bought a five-cent load of bread you laid down
an additional two cents, which went to Mr. Kinsolving as a testimonial to his perspicacity.
A second result was that Mr. Kinsolving quit the game with $2,000,000 prof - er -
rake-off.
Mr. Kinsolving&rsquo;s son Dan was at college when the mathematical experiment in
breadstuffs was made. Dan came home during vacation, and found the old gentleman in a
red dressing-gown reading &ldquo;Little Dorrit&rdquo; on the porch of his estimable red brick mansion in
Washington Square. He had retired from business with enough extra two-cent pieces from
bread buyers to reach, if laid side by side, fifteen times around the earth and lap as far as the
public debt of Paraguay.
Dan shook hands with his father, and hurried over to Greenwich Village to see his old
high-school friend, Kenwitz. Dan had always admired Kenwitz. Kenwitz was pale, curly-haired,
intense, serious, mathematical, studious, altruistic, socialistic, and the natural foe of
oligarchies. Kenwitz had foregone college, and was learning watch-making in his father&rsquo;s
jewelry store. Dan was smiling, jovial, easy-tempered and tolerant alike of kings and
ragpickers. The two foregathered joyously, being opposites. And then Dan went back to
college, and Kenwitz to his mainsprings - and to his private library in the rear of the jewelry
shop.
Four years later Dan came back to Washington Square with the accumulations of B. A.
and two years of Europe thick upon him. He took a filial look at Septimus Kinsolving&rsquo;s
elaborate tombstone in Greenwood and a tedious excursion through typewritten documents
with the family lawyer; and then, feeling himself a lonely and hopeless millionaire, hurried
down to the old jewelry store across Sixth Avenue.
Kenwitz unscrewed a magnifying glass from his eye, routed out his parent from a dingy
rear room, and abandoned the interior of watches for outdoors. He went with Dan, and they
sat on a bench in Washington Square. Dan had not changed much; he was stalwart, and had
a dignity that was inclined to relax into a grin. Kenwitz was more serious, more intense,
more learned, philosophical and socialistic.
&ldquo;I know about it now,&rdquo; said Dan, finally. &ldquo;I pumped it out of the eminent legal lights that
turned over to me poor old dad&rsquo;s collections of bonds and boodle. It amounts to $2,000,000,
Ken. And I am told that he squeezed it out of the chaps that pay their pennies for loaves of
bread at little bakeries around the corner. You&rsquo;ve studied economics, Dan, and you know all
about monopolies, and the masses, and octopuses, and the rights of laboring people. I never
thought about those things before. Football and trying to be white to my fellowman were
about the extent of my college curriculum.&ldquo;But since I came back and found out how dad made his money I&rsquo;ve been thinking. I&rsquo;d
like awfully well to pay back those chaps who had to give up too much money for bread. I
know it would buck the line of my income for a good many yards; but I&rsquo;d like to make it
square with &lsquo;em. Is there any way it can be done, old Ways and Means?&rdquo;
Kenwitz&rsquo;s big black eyes glowed fierily. His thin, intellectual face took on almost a
sardonic cast. He caught Dan&rsquo;s arm with the grip of a friend and a judge.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; he said, emphatically. &ldquo;One of the chief punishments of you men of
ill-gotten wealth is that when you do repent you find that you have lost the power to make
reparation or restitution. I admire your good intentions, Dan, but you can&rsquo;t do anything.
Those people were robbed of their precious pennies. It&rsquo;s too late to remedy the evil. You
can&rsquo;t pay them back&rdquo;
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Dan, lighting his pipe, &ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t hunt up every one of the duffers
and hand &lsquo;em back the right change. There&rsquo;s an awful lot of &lsquo;em buying bread all the time.
Funny taste they have - I never cared for bread especially, except for a toasted cracker with
the Roquefort. But we might find a few of &lsquo;em and chuck some of dad&rsquo;s cash back where it
came from I&rsquo;d feel better if I could. It seems tough for people to be held up for a soggy thing
like bread. One wouldn&rsquo;t mind standing a rise in broiled lobsters or deviled crabs. Get to
work and think, Ken. I want to pay back all that money I can.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There are plenty of charities,&rdquo; said Kenwitz, mechanically.
&ldquo;Easy enough,&rdquo; said Dan, in a cloud of smoke. &ldquo;I suppose I could give the city a park, or
endow an asparagus bed in a hospital. But I don&rsquo;t want Paul to get away with the proceeds
of the gold brick we sold Peter. It&rsquo;s the bread shorts I want to cover, Ken.&rdquo;
The thin fingers of Kenwitz moved rapidly.
&ldquo;Do you know how much money it would take to pay back the losses of consumers
during that corner in flour?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;I do not.&rdquo; said Dan, stoutly. &ldquo;My lawyer tells me that I have two millions.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If you had a hundred millions,&rdquo; said Kenwitz, vehemently, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t repair a
thousandth part of the damage that has been done. You cannot conceive of the
accumulated evils produced by misapplied wealth. Each penny that was wrung from the lean
purses of the poor reacted a thousandfold to their harm. You do not understand. You do not
see how hopeless is your desire to make restitution. Not in a single instance can it be done.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Back up, philosopher!&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;The penny has no sorrow that the dollar cannot
heal.&ldquo;&ldquo;Not in one instance,&rdquo; repeated Kenwitz. &ldquo;I will give you one, and let us see. Thomas
Boyne had a little bakery over there in Varick Street. He sold bread to the poorest people.
When the price of flour went up he had to raise the price of bread. His customers were too
poor to pay it, Boyne&rsquo;s business failed and he lost his $1,000 capital - all he had in the
world.&rdquo;
Dan Kinsolving struck the park bench a mighty blow with his fist.
&ldquo;I accept the instance,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Take me to Boyne. I will repay his thousand dollars
and buy him a new bakery.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Write your check,&rdquo; said Kenwitz, without moving, &ldquo;and then begin to write checks in
payment of the train of consequences. Draw the next one for $50,000. Boyne went insane
after his failure and set fire to the building from which he was about to be evicted. The loss
amounted to that much. Boyne died in an asylum.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Stick to the instance,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t noticed any insurance companies on my
charity list.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Draw your next check for $100,000,&rdquo; went on Kenwitz. &ldquo;Boyne&rsquo;s son fell into bad way
after the bakery closed, and was accused of murder. he was acquitted last week after a three
years&rsquo; legal battle, and the state draws upon taxpayers for that much expense.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Back to the bakery!&rdquo; exclaimed Dan, impatiently. &ldquo;The Government doesn&rsquo;t need to
stand in the bread line.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The last item of the instance is - come and I will show you,&rdquo; said Kenwitz, rising.
The Socialistic watchmaker was happy. He was a millionaire-baiter by nature and a
pessimist by trade. Kenwitz would assure you in one breath that money was but evil and
corruption, and that your brand-new watch needed cleaning and a new ratchet-wheel.
He conducted Kinsolving southward out of the square and into ragged,
poverty-haunted Varick Street. Up the narrow stairway of a squalid brick tenement he led
the penitent offspring of the Octupus. He knocked on a door, and a clear voice called to
them to enter.
In that almost bare room a young woman sat sewing at a machine. She nodded to
Kenwitz as to a familiar acquaintance. One little stream of sunlight through the dingy
window burnished her heavy hair to the color of an ancient Tuscan&rsquo;s shield. She flashed a
rippling smile at Kenwitz and a look of somewhat flustered inquiry.
Kinsolving stood regarding her clear and pathetic beauty in heart-throbbing silence.
Thus they came into the presence of the last item of the Instance.&ldquo;How many this week, Miss Mary?&rdquo; asked the watchmaker. A mountain of coarse gray
shirts lay upon the floor.
&ldquo;Nearly thirty dozen,&rdquo; said the young woman cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made almost $4. I&rsquo;m
improving, Mr. Kenwitz. I hardly know what to do with so much money.&rdquo; Her eyes turned,
brightly soft, in the direction of Dan. A little pink spot came out on her round, pale cheek.
Kenwitz chuckled like a diabolic raven.
&ldquo;Miss Boyne,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let me present Mr. Kinsolving, the son of the man who put
bread up five years ago. He thinks he would like to do something to aid those who where
inconvenienced by that act.&rdquo;
The smile left the young woman&rsquo;s face. She rose and pointed her forefinger toward the
door. This time she looked Kinsolving straight in the eye, but it was not a look that gave
delight.
The two men went down Varick Street. Kenwitz, letting all his pessimism and rancor
and hatred of the Octopus come to the surface, gibed at the moneyed side of his friend in an
acrid torrent of words. Dan appeared to be listening, and then turned to Kenwitz and shook
hands with him warmly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m obliged to you, Ken, old man,&rdquo; he said, vaguely -&ldquo;a thousand times obliged.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mein Gott! you are crazy!&rdquo; cried the watchmaker, dropping his spectacles for the first
time in years.
Two months afterward Kenwitz went into a large bakery on lower Broadway with a pair
of gold-rimmed eyeglasses that he had mended for the proprietor.
A lady was giving an order to a clerk as Kenwitz passed her.
&ldquo;These loaves are ten cents,&rdquo; said the clerk.
&ldquo;I always get them at eight cents uptown,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;You need not fill the order. I
will drive by there on my way home.&rdquo;
The voice was familiar. The watchmaker paused.
&ldquo;Mr. Kenwitz!&rdquo; cried the lady, heartily. &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo;
Kenwitz was trying to train his socialistic and economic comprehension on her
wonderful fur boa and the carriage waiting outside.&ldquo;Why, Miss Boyne!&rdquo; he began.
&ldquo;Mrs. Kinsolving,&rdquo; she corrected. &ldquo;Dan and I were married a month ago.&rdquo;
The Venturers （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>Let the story wreck itself on the spreading rails of the Non Sequitur. Limited, if it will;
first you must take your seat in the observation car &ldquo;Raison d&rsquo;etre&rdquo; for one moment. It is for
no longer than to consider a brief essay on the subject - let us call it: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Around the
Corner.&rdquo;
Omne mundus in duas partes divisum est - men who wear rubbers and pay poll-taxes,
and men who discover new continents. There are no more continents to discover; but by the
time overshoes are out of date and the poll has developed into an income tax, the other half
will be paralleling the canals of Mars with radium railways.
Fortune, Chance, and Adventure are given as synonymous in the dictionaries. To the
knowing each has a different meaning. Fortune is a prize to be won. Adventure is the road to
it. Chance is what may lurk in the shadows at the roadside. The face of Fortune is radiant
and alluring; that of Adventure is flushed and heroic. The face of Chance is the beautiful
countenance - perfect because vague and dream-born - that we see in our tea-cups at
breakfast while we growl over our chops and toast.
The VENTURER is one who keeps his eye on the hedgerows and wayside groves and
meadows while he travels the road to Fortune. That is the difference between him and the
Adventurer. Eating the forbidden fruit was the best record ever made by a Venturer. Trying
to prove that it happened is the highest work of the Adventuresome. To be either is
disturbing to the cosmogony of creation. So, as bracket-sawed and city-directoried citizens,
let us light our pipes, chide the children and the cat, arrange ourselves in the willow rocker
under the flickering gas jet at the coolest window and scan this little tale of two modern
followers of Chance.
&ldquo;Did you ever hear that story about the man from the West?&rdquo; asked Billinger, in the
little dark-oak room to your left as you penetrate the interior of the Powhatan Club.
&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said John Reginald Forster, rising and leaving the room.
Forster got his straw hat (straws will be in and maybe out again long before this is
printed) from the checkroom boy, and walked out of the air (as Hamlet says). Billinger wasused to having his stories insulted and would not mind. Forster was in his favorite mood and
wanted to go away from anywhere. A man, in order to get on good terms with himself, must
have his opinions corroborated and his moods matched by some one else. (I had written
that &ldquo;somebody&rdquo;; but an A. D. T. boy who once took a telegram for me pointed out that I
could save money by using the compound word. This is a vice versa case).
Forster&rsquo;s favorite mood was that of greatly desiring to be a follower of Chance. He was a
Venturer by nature, but convention, birth, tradition and the narrowing influences of the
tribe of Manhattan had denied him full privilege. He had trodden all the main-traveled
thoroughfares and many of the side roads that are supposed to relieve the tedium of life.
But none had sufficed. The reason was that he knew what was to be found at the end of
every street. He knew from experience and logic almost precisely to what end each
digression from routine must lead. He found a depressing monotony in all the variations that
the music of his sphere had grafted upon the tune of life. He had not learned that, although
the world was made round, the circle has been squared, and that it&rsquo;s true interest is to be in
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Around the Corner.&rdquo;
Forster walked abroad aimlessly from the Powhatan, trying not to tax either his
judgment or his desire as to what streets he traveled. He would have been glad to lose his
way if it were possible; but he had no hope of that. Adventure and Fortune move at your
beck and call in the Greater City; but Chance is oriental. She is a veiled lady in a sedan chair,
protected by a special traffic squad of dragonians. Crosstown, uptown, and downtown you
may move without seeing her.
At the end of an hour&rsquo;s stroll, Forster stood on a corner of a broad, smooth avenue,
looking disconsolately across it at a picturesque old hotel softly but brilliantly lit.
Disconsolately, because he knew that he must dine; and dining in that hotel was no venture.
It was one of his favorite caravansaries, and so silent and swift would be the service and so
delicately choice the food, that he regretted the hunger that must be appeased by the &ldquo;dead
perfection&rdquo; of the place&rsquo;s cuisine. Even the music there seemed to be always playing da
capo.
Fancy came to him that he would dine at some cheap, even dubious, restaurant lower
down in the city, where the erratic chefs from all countries of the world spread their national
cookery for the omnivorous American. Something might happen there out of the routine -
he might come upon a subject without a predicate, a road without an end, a question
without an answer, a cause without an effect, a gulf stream in life&rsquo;s salt ocean. He had not
dressed for evening; he wore a dark business suit that would not be questioned even where
the waiters served the spaghetti in their shirt sleeves.
So John Reginald Forster began to search his clothes for money; because the more
cheaply you dine, the more surely must you pay. All of the thirteen pockets, large and small,
of his business suit he explored carefully and found not a penny. His bank book showed a
balance of five figures to his credit in the Old Ironsides Trust Company, but -Forster became aware of a man nearby at his left hand who was really regarding him
with some amusement. he looked like any business man of thirty or so, neatly dressed and
standing in the attitude of one waiting for a street car. But there was no car line on that
avenue. So his proximity and unconcealed curiosity seemed to Forster to partake of the
nature of a personal intrusion. But, as he was a consistent seeker after &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Around the
Corner,&rdquo; instead of manifesting resentment he only turned a half-embarrassed smile upon
the other&rsquo;s grin of amusement.
&ldquo;All in?&rdquo; asked the intruder, drawing nearer.
&ldquo;Seems so,&rdquo; said Forster. &ldquo;Now, I thought there was a dollar in -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; said the other man, with a laugh. &ldquo;But there wasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve just been
through the same process myself, as I was coming around the corner. I found in an upper
vest pocket - I don&rsquo;t know how they got there - exactly two pennies. You know what kind of a
dinner exactly two pennies will buy!&rdquo;
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t dined, then?&rdquo; asked Forster.
&ldquo;I have not. But I would like to. Now, I&rsquo;ll make you a proposition. You look like a man
who would take up one. Your clothes look neat and respectable. Excuse personalities. I think
mine will pass the scrutiny of a head waiter, also. Suppose we go over to that hotel and dine
together. We will choose from the menu like millionaires - or, if you prefer, like gentlemen in
moderate circumstances dining extravagantly for once. When we have finished we will
match with my two pennies to see which of us will stand the brunt of the house&rsquo;s
displeasure and vengeance. My name is Ives. I think we have lived in the same station of life
- before our money took wings.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on,&rdquo; said Forster, joyfully.
Here was a venture at least within the borders of the mysterious country of Change -
anyhow, it promised something better than the stale infestivity of a table d&rsquo;hote.
The two were soon seated at a corner table in the hotel dining room. Ives chucked one
of his pennies across the table to Forster.
&ldquo;Match for which of us gives the order,&rdquo; he said.
Forster lost.
Ives laughed and began to name liquids and viands to the waiter with the absorbed but
calm deliberation of one who was to the menu born. Forster, listening, gave his admiring
approval of the order.&ldquo;I am a man,&rdquo; said Ives, during the oysters, &ldquo;Who has made a lifetime search after the
to-be-continued-in-our-next. I am not like the ordinary adventurer who strikes for a coveted
prize. Nor yet am I like a gambler who knows he is either to win or lose a certain set stake.
What I want is to encounter an adventure to which I can predict no conclusion. It is the
breath of existence to me to dare Fate in its blindest manifestations. The world has come to
run so much by rote and gravitation that you can enter upon hardly any footpath of chance
in which you do not find signboards informing you of what you may expect at its end. I am
like the clerk in the Circumlocution Office who always complained bitterly when any one
came in to ask information. &lsquo;He wanted to know, you know!&rsquo; was the kick he made to his
fellow-clerks. Well, I don&rsquo;t want to know, I don&rsquo;t want to reason, I don&rsquo;t want to guess - I
want to bet my hand without seeing it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Forster delightedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wanted the way I feel put into words.
You&rsquo;ve done it. I want to take chances on what&rsquo;s coming. Suppose we have a bottle of
Moselle with the next course.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Ives. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you catch my idea. It will increase the animosity of the
house toward the loser. If it does not weary you, we will pursue the theme. Only a few times
have I met a true venturer - one who does not ask a schedule and map from Fate when he
begins a journey. But, as the world becomes more civilized and wiser, the more difficult it is
to come upon an adventure the end of which you cannot foresee. In the Elizabethan days
you could assault the watch, wring knockers from doors and have a jolly set-to with the
blades in any convenient angle of a wall and &lsquo;get away with it.&rsquo; Nowadays, if you speak
disrespectfully to a policeman, all that is left to the most romantic fancy is to conjecture in
what particular police station he will land you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know - I know,&rdquo; said Forster, nodding approval.
&ldquo;I returned to New York to-day,&rdquo; continued Ives, &ldquo;from a three years&rsquo; ramble around the
globe. Things are not much better abroad than they are at home. The whole world seems to
be overrun by conclusions. The only thing that interests me greatly is a premise. I&rsquo;ve tried
shooting big game in Africa. I know what an express rifle will do at so many yards; and when
an elephant or a rhinoceros falls to the bullet, I enjoy it about as much as I did when I was
kept in after school to do a sum in long division on the blackboard.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know - I know,&rdquo; said Forster.
&ldquo;There might be something in aeroplanes,&rdquo; went on Ives, reflectively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried
ballooning; but it seems to be merely a cut-and-dried affair of wind and ballast.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Women,&rdquo; suggested Forster, with a smile.&ldquo;Three months ago,&rdquo; said Ives. &ldquo;I was pottering around in one of the bazaars in
Constantinople. I noticed a lady, veiled, of course, but with a pair of especially fine eyes
visible, who was examining some amber and pearl ornaments at one of the booths. With
her was an attendant - a big Nubian, as black as coal. After a while the attendant drew
nearer to me by degrees and slipped a scrap of paper into my hand. I looked at it when I got
a chance. On it was scrawled hastily in pencil: &lsquo;The arched gate of the Nghtingale Garden at
nine to-night.&rsquo; Does that appear to you to be an interesting premise, Mr. Forster?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I made inquiries and learned that the Nightingale Garden was the property of an old
Turk - a grand vizier, or something of the sort. Of course I prospected for the arched gate and
was there at nine. The same Nubian attendant opened the gate promptly on time, and I
went inside and sat on a bench by a perfumed fountain with the veiled lady. We had quite
an extended chat. She was Myrtle Thompson, a lady journalist, who was writing up the
Turkish harems for a Chicago newspaper. She said she noticed the New York cut of my
clothes in the bazaar and wondered if I couldn&rsquo;t work something into the metropolitan
papers about it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Forster. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve canoed through Canada,&rdquo; said Ives, &ldquo;down many rapids and over many falls. But I
didn&rsquo;t seem to get what I wanted out of it because I knew there were only two possible
outcomes - I would either go to the bottom or arrive at the sea level. I&rsquo;ve played all games at
cards; but the mathematicians have spoiled that sport by computing the percentages. I&rsquo;ve
made acquaintances on trains, I&rsquo;ve answered advertisements, I&rsquo;ve rung strange door-bells,
I&rsquo;ve taken every chance that presented itself; but there has always been the conventional
ending - the logical conclusion to the premise.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; repeated Forster. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve felt it all. But I&rsquo;ve had few chances to take my chance at
chances. Is there any life so devoid of impossibilities as life in this city? There seems to be a
myriad of opportunities for testing the undeterminable; but not one in a thousand fails to
land you where you expected it to stop. I wish the subways and street cars disappointed one
as seldom.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The sun has risen,&rdquo; said Ives, &ldquo;on the Arabian nights. There are no more caliphs. The
fisherman&rsquo;s vase is turned to a vacuum bottle, warranted to keep any genie boiling or frozen
for forty-eight hours. Life moves by rote. Science has killed adventure. There are no more
opportunities such as Columbus and the man who ate the first oyster had. The only certain
thing is that there is nothing uncertain.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Forster, &ldquo;my experience has been the limited one of a city man. I haven&rsquo;t
seen the world as you have; but it seems that we view it with the same opinion. But, I tell
you I am grateful for even this little venture of ours into the borders of the haphazard. There
may be at least one breathless moment when the bill for the dinner is presented. Perhaps,
after all, the pilgrims who traveled without scrip or purse found a keener taste to life thandid the knights of the Round Table who rode abroad with a retinue and King Arthur&rsquo;s
certified checks in the lining of their helmets. And now, if you&rsquo;ve finished your coffee,
suppose we match one of your insufficient coins for the impending blow of Fate. What have
I up?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Heads,&rdquo; called Ives.
&ldquo;Heads it is,&rdquo; said Forster, lifting his hand. &ldquo;I lose. We forgot to agree upon a plan for
the winner to escape. I suggest that when the waiter comes you make a remark about
telephoning to a friend. I will hold the fort and the dinner check long enough for you to get
your hat and be off. I thank you for an evening out of the ordinary, Mr. Ives, and wish we
might have others.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If my memory is not at fault,&rdquo; said Ives, laughing, &ldquo;the nearest police station is in
MacDougal Street. I have enjoyed the dinner, too, let me assure you.&rdquo;
Forster crooked his finger for the waiter. Victor, with a locomotive effort that seemed to
owe more to pneumatics than to pedestrianism, glided to the table and laid the card, face
downward, by the loser&rsquo;s cup. Forster took it up and added the figures with deliberate care.
Ives leaned back comfortably in his chair.
&ldquo;Escuse me,&rdquo; said Forster; &ldquo;but I though you were going to ring Grimes about that
theatre party for Thursday night. Had you forgotten about it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Ives, settling himself more comfortably, &ldquo;I can do that later on. Get me a
glass of water, waiter.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Want to be in at the death, do you?&rdquo; asked Forster.
&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t object,&rdquo; said Ives, pleadingly. &ldquo;Never in my life have I seen a
gentleman arrested in a public restaurant for swindling it out of a dinner.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Forster, calmly. &ldquo;You are entitled to see a Christian die in the arena as
your pousse-cafe.&rdquo;
Victor came with the glass of water and remained, with the disengaged air of an
inexorable collector.
Forster hesitated for fifteen seconds, and then took a pencil from his pocket and
scribbled his name on the dinner check. The waiter bowed and took it away.
&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Forster, with a little embarrassed laugh, &ldquo;I doubt whether I&rsquo;m what
they call a &lsquo;game sport,&rsquo; which means the same as a &lsquo;soldier of Fortune.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll have to make a
confession. I&rsquo;ve been dining at this hotel two or three times a week for more than a year. Ialways sign my checks.&rdquo; And then, with a note of appreciation in his voice: &ldquo;It was first-rate
of you to stay to see me through with it when you knew I had no money, and that you might
be scooped in, too.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll confess, too,&rdquo; said Ives, with a grin. &ldquo;I own the hotel. I don&rsquo;t run it, of course,
but I always keep a suite on the third floor for my use when I happen to stray into town.&rdquo;
He called a waiter and said: &ldquo;Is Mr. Gilmore still behind the desk? All right. Tell him that
Mr. Ives is here, and ask him to have my rooms made ready and aired.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Another venture cut short by the inevitable,&rdquo; said Forster. &ldquo;Is there a conundrum
without an answer in the next number? But let&rsquo;s hold to our subject just for a minute or two,
if you will. It isn&rsquo;t often that I meet a man who understands the flaws I pick in existence. I am
engaged to be married a month from to-day.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I reserve comment,&rdquo; said Ives.
&ldquo;Right; I am going to add to the assertion. I am devotedly fond of the lady; but I can&rsquo;t
decide whether to show up at the church or make a sneak for Alaska. It&rsquo;s the same idea, you
know, that we were discussing - it does for a fellow as far as possibilities are concerned.
Everybody knows the routine - you get a kiss flavored with Ceylon tea after breakfast; you go
to the office; you come back home and dress for dinner - theatre twice a week - bills -
moping around most evenings trying to make conversation - a little quarrel occasionally -
maybe sometimes a big one, and a separation - or else a settling down into a middle-aged
contentment, which is worst of all.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Ives, nodding wisely.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the dead certainty of the thing,&rdquo; went on Forster, &ldquo;that keeps me in doubt. There&rsquo;ll
nevermore be anything around the corner.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nothing after the &lsquo;Little Church,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Ives. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Understand,&rdquo; said Forster, &ldquo;that I am in no doubt as to my feelings toward the lady. I
may say that I love her truly and deeply. But there is something in the current that runs
through my veins that cries out against any form of the calculable. I do not know what I want;
but I know that I want it. I&rsquo;m talking like an idiot, I suppose, but I&rsquo;m sure of what I mean.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said Ives, with a slow smile. &ldquo;Well, I think I will be going up to my
rooms now. If you would dine with me here one evening soon, Mr. Forster, I&rsquo;d be glad.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thursday?&rdquo; suggested Forster.
&ldquo;At seven, if it&rsquo;s convenient,&rdquo; answered Ives.&ldquo;Seven goes,&rdquo; assented Forster.
At halft-past eight Ives got into a cab and was driven to a number in one of the correct
West Seventies. His card admitted him to the reception room of an old-fashioned house into
which the spirits of Fortune, Chance and Adventure had never dared to enter. On the walls
were the Whistler etchings, the steel engravings by Oh-what&rsquo;s-his-name?, the still-life
paintings of the grapes and garden truck with the watermelon seeds spilled on the table as
natural as life, and the Greuze head. It was a household. There was even brass andirons. On
a table was an album, half-morocco, with oxidized-silver protections on the corners of the
lids. A clock on the mantel ticked loudly, with a warning click at five minutes to nine. Ives
looked at it curiously, remembering a time-piece in his grandmother&rsquo;s home that gave such a
warning.
And then down the stairs and into the room came Mary Marsden. She was twenty-four,
and I leave her to your imagination. But I must say this much - youth and health and
simplicity and courage and greenish-violet eyes are beautiful, and she had all these. She
gave Ives her hand with the sweet cordiality of an old friendship.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think what a pleasure it is,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to have you drop in once every three
years or so.&rdquo;
For half an hour they talked. I confess that I cannot repeat the conversation. You will
find it in books in the circulating library. When that part of it was over, Mary said:
&ldquo;And did you find what you wanted while you were abroad?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What I wanted?&rdquo; said Ives.
&ldquo;Yes. You know you were always queer. Even as a boy you wouldn&rsquo;t play marbles or
baseball or any game with rules. You wanted to dive in water where you didn&rsquo;t know
whether it was ten inches or ten feet deep. And when you grew up you were just the same.
We&rsquo;ve often talked about your peculiar ways.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I suppose I am an incorrigible,&rdquo; said Ives. &ldquo;I am opposed to the doctrine of
predestination, to the rule of three, gravitation, taxation, and everything of the kind. Life has
always seemed to me something like a serial story would be if they printed above each
instalment a synopsis of succeeding chapters.&rdquo;
Mary laughed merrily.
&ldquo;Bob Ames told us once,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;of a funny thing you did. It was when you and he
were on a train in the South, and you got off at a town where you hadn&rsquo;t intended to stopjust because the brakeman hung up a sign in the end of the car with the name of the next
station on it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Ives. &ldquo;That &lsquo;next station&rsquo; has been the thing I&rsquo;ve always tried to get
away from.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been very foolish. I hope you didn&rsquo;t find what you
wanted not to find, or get off at the station where there wasn&rsquo;t any, or whatever it was you
expected wouldn&rsquo;t happen to you during the three years you&rsquo;ve been away.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There was something I wanted before I went away,&rdquo; said Ives.
Mary looked in his eyes clearly, with a slight, but perfectly sweet smile.
&ldquo;There was,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You wanted me. And you could have had me, as you very well
know.&rdquo;
Without replying, Ives let his gaze wander slowly about the room. There had been no
change in it since last he had been in it, three years before. He vividly recalled the thoughts
that had been in his mind then. The contents of that room were as fixed in their way, as the
everlasting hills. No change would ever come there except the inevitable ones wrought by
time and decay. That silver-mounted album would occupy that corner of that table, those
pictures would hang on the walls, those chairs be found in their same places every morn and
noon and night while the household hung together. The brass andirons were monuments to
order and stability. Herre and there were relics of a hundred years ago which were still living
mementos and would be for many years to come. One going from and coming back to that
house would never need to forecast or doubt. He would find what he left, and leave what he
found. The veiled lady, Chance, would never lift her hand to the knocker on the outer door.
And before him sat the lady who belonged in the room. Cool and sweet and
unchangeable she was. She offered no surprises. If one should pass his life with her, though
she might grow white-haired and wrinkled, he would never perceive the change. Three years
he had been away from her, and she was still waiting for him as established and constant as
the house itself. He was sure that she had once cared for him. It was the knowledge that she
would always do so that had driven him away. Thus his thoughts ran.
&ldquo;I am going to be married soon,&rdquo; said Mary.
On the next Thursday afternoon Forster came hurriedly to Ive&rsquo;s hotel.
&ldquo;Old man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to put that dinner off for a year or so; I&rsquo;m going abroad.
The steamer sails at four. That was a great talk we had the other night, and it decided me.
I&rsquo;m going to knock around the world and get rid of that incubus that has been weighing on
both you and me - the terrible dread of knowing what&rsquo;s going to happen. I&rsquo;ve done one thingthat hurts my conscience a little; but I know it&rsquo;s best for both of us. I&rsquo;ve written to the lady to
whom I was engaged and explained everything - told her plainly why I was leaving - that the
monotony of matrimony would never do for me. Don&rsquo;t you think I was right?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is not for me to say,&rdquo; answered Ives. &ldquo;Go ahead and shoot elephants if you think it
will bring the element of chance into your life. We&rsquo;ve got to decide these things for
ourselves. But I tell you one thing, Forster, I&rsquo;ve found the way. I&rsquo;ve found out the biggest
hazard in the world - a game of chance that never is concluded, a venture that may end in
the highest heaven or the blackest pit. It will keep a man on edge until the clods fall on his
coffin, because he will never know - not until his last day, and not then will he know. It is a
voayge without a rudder or compass, and you must be captain and crew and keep watch,
every day and night, yourself, with no one to relieve you. I have found the VENTURE. Don&rsquo;t
bother yourself about leaving Mary Marsden, Forster. I married her yesterday at noon.&rdquo;
The Whirligig of Life （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>JUSTICE-OF-THE-PEACE Benaja Widdup sat in the door of his office smoking his
elder-stem pipe. Halfway to the zenith the Cumberland range rose blue-gray in the
afternoon haze. A speckled hen swaggered down the main street of the &ldquo;settlement,&rdquo;
cackling foolishly.
Up the road came a sound of creaking axles, and then a slow cloud of dust, and then a
bull-cart bearing Ransie Bilbro and his wife. The cart stopped at the Justice&rsquo;s door, and the
two climbed down. Ransie was a narrow six feet of sallow brown skin and yellow hair. The
imperturbability of the mountains hung upon him like a suit of armour. The woman was
calicoed, angled, snuff-brushed, and weary with unknown desires. Through it all gleamed a
faint protest of cheated youth unconscious of its loss.
The Justice of the Peace slipped his feet into his shoes, for the sake of dignity, and
moved to let them enter.
&ldquo;We-all,&rdquo; said the woman, in a voice like the wind blowing through pine boughs, &ldquo;wants
a divo&rsquo;ce.&rdquo; She looked at Ransie to see if he noted any flaw or ambiguity or evasion or
partiality or self-partisanship in her statement of their business.
&ldquo;A divo&rsquo;ce,&rdquo; repeated Ransie, with a solemn Dod. &ldquo;We-all can&rsquo;t git along together
nohow. It&rsquo;s lonesome enough fur to live in the mount&rsquo;ins when a man and a woman keers
fur one another. But when she&rsquo;s a-spittin&rsquo; like a wildcat or a-sullenin&rsquo; like a hoot-owl in the
cabin, a man ain&rsquo;t got no call to live with her.&ldquo;&ldquo;When he&rsquo;s a no-&lsquo;count varmint,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;without any especial warmth,
a-traipsin&rsquo; along of scalawags and moonshiners and a-layin&rsquo; on his back pizen &lsquo;ith co&rsquo;n
whiskey, and a-pesterin&rsquo; folks with a pack o&rsquo; hungry, triflin&rsquo; houn&rsquo;s to feed!&rdquo;
&ldquo;When she keeps a-throwin&rsquo; skillet lids,&rdquo; came Ransie&rsquo;s antiphony, &ldquo;and slings b&rsquo;ilin&rsquo;
water on the best coon-dog in the Cumberlands, and sets herself agin&rsquo; cookin&rsquo; a man&rsquo;s
victuals, and keeps him awake o&rsquo; nights accusin&rsquo; him of a sight of doin&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
&ldquo;When he&rsquo;s al&rsquo;ays a-fightin&rsquo; the revenues, and gits a hard name in the mount&rsquo;ins fur a
mean man, who&rsquo;s gwine to be able fur to sleep o&rsquo; nights?&rdquo;
The Justice of the Peace stirred deliberately to his duties. He placed his one chair and a
wooden stool for his petitioners. He opened his book of statutes on the table and scanned
the index. Presently he wiped his spectacles and shifted his inkstand.
&ldquo;The law and the statutes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;air silent on the subjeck of divo&rsquo;ce as fur as the
jurisdiction of this co&rsquo;t air concerned. But, accordin&rsquo; to equity and the Constitution and the
golden rule, it&rsquo;s a bad barg&rsquo;in that can&rsquo;t run both ways. If a justice of the peace can marry a
couple, it&rsquo;s plain that he is bound to be able to divo&rsquo;ce &lsquo;em. This here office will issue a
decree of divo&rsquo;ce and abide by the decision of the Supreme Co&rsquo;t to hold it good.&rdquo;
Ransie Bilbro drew a small tobacco-bag from his trousers pocket. Out of this he shook
upon the table a five-dollar note. &ldquo;Sold a b&rsquo;arskin and two foxes fur that,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
all the money we got.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The regular price of a divo&rsquo;ce in this co&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Justice, &ldquo;air five dollars.&rdquo; He stuffed
the bill into the pocket of his homespun vest with a deceptive air of indifference. With much
bodily toil and mental travail he wrote the decree upon half a sheet of foolscap, and then
copied it upon the other. Ransie Bilbro and his wife listened to his reading of the document
that was to give them freedom:
&ldquo;Know all men by these presents that Ransie Bilbro and his wife, Ariela Bilbro, this day
personally appeared before me and promises that hereinafter they will neither love, honour,
nor obey each other, neither for better nor worse, being of sound mind and body, and
accept summons for divorce according to the peace and dignity of the State. Herein fail not,
so help you God. Benaja Widdup, justice of the peace in and for the county of Piedmont,
State of Tennessee.&rdquo;
The Justice was about to hand one of the documents to Ransie. The voice of Ariela
delayed the transfer. Both men looked at her. Their dull masculinity was confronted by
something sudden and unexpected in the woman.
&ldquo;Judge, don&rsquo;t you give him that air paper yit. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t all settled, nohow. I got to have my
rights first. I got to have my ali-money. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no kind of a way to do fur a man to divo&rsquo;ce hiswife &lsquo;thout her havin&rsquo; a cent fur to do with. I&rsquo;m a-layin&rsquo; off to be a-goin&rsquo; up to brother Ed&rsquo;s up
on Hogback Mount&rsquo;in. I&rsquo;m bound fur to hev a pa&rsquo;r of shoes and some snuff and things
besides. Ef Rance kin affo&rsquo;d a divo&rsquo;ce, let him pay me ali-money.&rdquo;
Ransie Bilbro was stricken to dumb perplexity. There had been no previous hint of
alimony. Women were always bringing up startling and unlooked-for issues.
Justice Benaja Widdup felt that the point demanded judicial decision. The authorities
were also silent on the subject of alimony. But the woman&rsquo;s feet were bare. The trail to
Hogback Mountain was steep and flinty.
&ldquo;Ariela Bilbro,&rdquo; he asked, in official tones, &ldquo;how much did you &lsquo;low would be good and
sufficient ali-money in the case befo&rsquo; the co&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I &lsquo;lowed,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;fur the shoes and all, to say five dollars. That ain&rsquo;t much fur
ali-money, but I reckon that&rsquo;ll git me to up brother Ed&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The amount,&rdquo; said the Justice, &ldquo;air not onreasonable. Ransie Bilbro, you air ordered by
the co&rsquo;t to pay the plaintiff the sum of five dollars befo&rsquo; the decree of divo&rsquo;ce air issued.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t no mo&rsquo; money,&rdquo; breathed Ransie, heavily. &ldquo;I done paid you all I had.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Otherwise,&rdquo; said the Justice, looking severely over his spectacles, &ldquo;you air in contempt
of co&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I reckon if you gimme till to-morrow,&rdquo; pleaded the husband, &ldquo;I mout be able to rake or
scrape it up somewhars. I never looked for to be a-payin&rsquo; no alimoney.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The case air adjourned,&rdquo; said Benaja Widdup, &ldquo;till to-morrow, when you-all will
present yo&rsquo;selves and obey the order of the co&rsquo;t. Followin&rsquo; of which the decrees of divo&rsquo;ce
will be delivered.&rdquo; He sat down in the door and began to loosen a shoestring.
&ldquo;We mout as well go down to Uncle Ziah&rsquo;s,&rdquo; decided Ransie, &ldquo;and spend the night.&rdquo; He
climbed into the cart on one side, and Ariela climbed in on the other. Obeying the flap of his
rope, the little red bull slowly came around on a tack, and the cart crawled away in the
nimbus arising from its wheels.
Justice-of-the-peace Benaja Widdup smoked his elderstem pipe. Late in the afternoon
he got his weekly paper, and read it until the twilight dimmed its lines. Then he lit the tallow
candle on his table, and read until the moon rose, marking the time for supper. He lived in
the double log cabin on the slope near the girdled poplar. Going home to supper he crossed
a little branch darkened by a laurel thicket. The dark figure of a man stepped from the
laurels and pointed a rifle at his breast. His hat was pulled down low, and something covered
most of his face.&ldquo;I want yo&rsquo; money,&rdquo; said the figure, &ldquo;&lsquo;thout any talk. I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; nervous, and my finger&rsquo;s
a-wabblin&rsquo; on this here trigger.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only got f-f-five dollars,&rdquo; said the Justice, producing it from his vest pocket.
&ldquo;Roll it up,&rdquo; came the order, &ldquo;and stick it in the end of this here gun-bar&rsquo;l.&rdquo;
The bill was crisp and new. Even fingers that were clumsy and trembling found little
difficulty in making a spill of it and inserting it (this with less ease) into the muzzle of the
rifle.
&ldquo;Now I reckon you kin be goin&rsquo; along,&rdquo; said the robber.
The Justice lingered not on his way.
The next day came the little red bull, drawing the cart to the office door. Justice Benaja
Widdup had his shoes on, for he was expecting the visit. In his presence Ransie Bilbro
handed to his wife a five-dollar bill. The official&rsquo;s eye sharply viewed it. It seemed to curl up
as though it had been rolled and inserted into the end of a gun-barrel. But the Justice
refrained from comment. It is true that other bills might be inclined to curl. He handed each
one a decree of divorce. Each stood awkwardly silent, slowly folding the guarantee of
freedom. The woman cast a shy glance full of constraint at Ransie.
&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo; back up to the cabin,&rdquo; she said, along &lsquo;ith the bull-cart. There&rsquo;s
bread in the tin box settin&rsquo; on the shelf. I put the bacon in the b&rsquo;ilin&rsquo;-pot to keep the hounds
from gittin&rsquo; it. Don&rsquo;t forget to wind the clock to-night.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You air a-goin&rsquo; to your brother Ed&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Ransie, with fine unconcern.
&ldquo;I was &lsquo;lowin&rsquo; to get along up thar afore night. I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; as they&rsquo;ll pester theyselves
any to make me welcome, but I hain&rsquo;t nowhar else fur to go. It&rsquo;s a right smart ways, and I
reckon I better be goin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll be a-sayin&rsquo; good-bye, Ranse - that is, if you keer fur to say so.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as anybody&rsquo;s a hound dog,&rdquo; said Ransie, in a martyr&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;fur to not
want to say good-bye &ndash; &lsquo;less you air so anxious to git away that you don&rsquo;t want me to say it.&rdquo;
Ariela was silent. She folded the five-dollar bill and her decree carefully, and placed
them in the bosom of her dress. Benaja Widdup watched the money disappear with
mournful eyes behind his spectacles.
And then with his next words he achieved rank (as his thoughts ran) with either the
great crowd of the world&rsquo;s sympathizers or the little crowd of its great financiers.&ldquo;Be kind o&rsquo; lonesome in the old cabin to-night, Ranse,&rdquo; he said.
Ransie Bilbro stared out at the Cumberlands, clear blue now in the sunlight. He did not
look at Ariela.
&ldquo;I &lsquo;low it might be lonesome,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but when folks gits mad and wants a divo&rsquo;ce,
you can&rsquo;t make folks stay.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s others wanted a divo&rsquo;ce,&rdquo; said Ariela, speaking to the wooden stool. &ldquo;Besides,
nobody don&rsquo;t want nobody to stay.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nobody never said they didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nobody never said they did. I reckon I better start on now to brother Ed&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nobody can&rsquo;t wind that old clock.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Want me to go back along &lsquo;ith you in the cart and wind it fur you, Ranse?&rdquo;
The mountaineer&rsquo;s countenance was proof against emotion. But he reached out a big
hand and enclosed Ariela&rsquo;s thin brown one. Her soul peeped out once through her impassive
face, hallowing it.
&ldquo;Them hounds shan&rsquo;t pester you no more,&rdquo; said Ransie. &ldquo;I reckon I been mean and low
down. You wind that clock, Ariela.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My heart hit&rsquo;s in that cabin, Ranse,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;along &lsquo;ith you. I ai&rsquo;nt a-goin&rsquo; to git
mad no more. Le&rsquo;s be startin&rsquo;, Ranse, so&rsquo;s we kin git home by sundown.&rdquo;
Justice-of-the-peace Benaja Widdup interposed as they started for the door, forgetting his
presence.
&ldquo;In the name of the State of Tennessee,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I forbid you-all to be a-defyin&rsquo; of its
laws and statutes. This co&rsquo;t is mo&rsquo; than willin&rsquo; and full of joy to see the clouds of discord and
misunderstandin&rsquo; rollin&rsquo; away from two lovin&rsquo; hearts, but it air the duty of the co&rsquo;t to
p&rsquo;eserve the morals and integrity of the State. The co&rsquo;t reminds you that you air no longer
man and wife, but air divo&rsquo;ced by regular decree, and as such air not entitled to the benefits
and &lsquo;purtenances of the mattermonal estate.&rdquo;
Ariela caught Ransie&rsquo;s arm. Did those words mean that she must lose him now when
they had just learned the lesson of life?
&ldquo;But the co&rsquo;t air prepared,&rdquo; went on the Justice, &ldquo;fur to remove the disabilities set up by
the decree of divo&rsquo;ce. The co&rsquo;t air on hand to perform the solemn ceremony of marri&rsquo;ge,
thus fixin&rsquo; things up and enablin&rsquo; the parties in the case to resume the honour&rsquo;ble andelevatin&rsquo; state of mattermony which they desires. The fee fur performin&rsquo; said ceremony will
be, in this case, to wit, five dollars.&rdquo;
Aricla caught the gleam of promise in his words. Swiftly her hand went to her bosom.
Freely as an alighting dove the bill fluttered to the Justice&rsquo;s table. Her sallow cheek coloured
as she stood hand in hand with Ransie and listened to the reuniting words.
Ransie helped her into the cart, and climbed in beside her. The little red bull turned
once more, and they set out, hand-clasped, for the mountains.
Justice-of-the-peace Benaja Widdup sat in his door and took off his shoes. Once again
he fingered the bill tucked down in his vest pocket. Once again he smoked his elder-stem
pipe. Once again the speck-led hen swaggered down the main street of the &ldquo;settlement,&rdquo;
cackling foolishly.
The World and the Door （O·Henry）</p>

<hr />

<p>A favourite dodge to get your story read by the public is to assert that it is true, and
then add that Truth is stranger than Fiction. I do not know if the yarn I am anxious for you to
read is true; but the Spanish purser of the fruit steamer El Carrero swore to me by the shrine
of Santa Guadalupe that he had the facts from the U. S. vice-consul at La Paz - a person who
could not possibly have been cognizant of half of them.
As for the adage quoted above, I take pleasure in punc- turing it by affirming that I read
in a purely fictional story the other day the line: &ldquo;&lsquo;Be it so,&rsquo; said the police- man.&rdquo; Nothing so
strange has yet cropped out in Truth.
When H. Ferguson Hedges, millionaire promoter, investor and man-about-New-York,
turned his thoughts upon matters convivial, and word of it went &ldquo;down the line,&rdquo; bouncers
took a precautionary turn at the Indian clubs, waiters put ironstone china on his favourite
tables, cab drivers crowded close to the curbstone in front of all-night cafés, and careful
cashiers in his regular haunts charged up a few bottles to his account by way of preface and
introduction.
As a money power a one-millionaire is of small account in a city where the man who
cuts your slice of beef behind the free-lunch counter rides to work in his own automobile.
But Hedges spent his money as lavishly, loudly and showily as though he were only a clerk
squandering a week&rsquo;s wages. And, after all, the bartender takes no interest in your reserve
fund. He would rather look you up on his cash register than in Bradstreet.On the evening that the material allegation of facts begins, Hedges was bidding dull
care begone in the com- pany of five or six good fellows &ndash; acquaintances and friends who
had gathered in his wake.
Among them were two younger men &ndash; Ralph Merriam, a broker, and Wade, his friend.
Two deep-sea cabmen were chartered. At Columbus Circle they hove to long enough to
revile the statue of the great navigator, unpatriotically rebuking him for having voyaged in
search of land instead of liquids. Midnight overtook the party marooned in the rear of a
cheap café far uptown.
Hedges was arrogant, overriding and quarrelsome. He was burly and tough, iron-gray
but vigorous, &ldquo;good&rdquo; for the rest of the night. There was a dispute &ndash; about nothing that
matters &ndash; and the five-fingered words were passed &ndash; the words that represent the glove
cast into the lists. Merriam played the r?le of the verbal Hotspur.
Hedges rose quickly, seized his chair, swung it once and smashed wildly dowp at
Merriam&rsquo;s head. Merriam dodged, drew a small revolver and shot Hedges in the chest. The
leading roysterer stumbled, fell in a wry heap, and lay still.
Wade, a commuter, had formed that habit of prompt- ness. He juggled Merriam out a
side door, walked him to the corner, ran him a block and caught a hansom. They rode five
minutes and then got out on a dark corner and dismissed the cab. Across the street the
lights of a small saloon betrayed its hectic hospitality.
&ldquo;Go in the back room of that saloon,&rdquo; said Wade, &ldquo;and wait. I&rsquo;ll go find out what&rsquo;s doing
and let you know. You may take two drinks while I am gone - no more.&rdquo;
At ten minutes to one o&rsquo;clock Wade returned. &ldquo;Brace up, old chap,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
ambulance got there just as I did. The doctor says he&rsquo;s dead. You may have one more drink.
You let me run this thing for you. You&rsquo;ve got to skip. I don&rsquo;t believe a chair is legally a deadly
weapon. You&rsquo;ve got to make tracks, that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;
Merriam complained of the cold querulously, and asked for another drink. &ldquo;Did you
notice what big veins he had on the back of his hands?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never could stand &ndash; I
never could &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Take one more,&rdquo; said Wade, &ldquo;and then come on. I&rsquo;ll see you through.&rdquo;
Wade kept his promise so well that at eleven o&rsquo;clock the next morning Merriam, with a
new suit case full of new clothes and hair-brushes, stepped quietly on board a little 500-ton
fruit steamer at an East River pier. The vessel had brought the season&rsquo;s first cargo of limes
from Port Limon, and was homeward bound. Merriam had his bank balance of $2,800 in hispocket in large bills, and brief instructions to pile up as much water as he could between
himself and New York. There was no time for anything more.
From Port Limon Merriam worked down the coast by schooner and sloop to Colon,
thence across the isthmus to Panama, where he caught a tramp bound for Callao and such
intermediate ports as might tempt the discursive skipper from his course.
It was at La Paz that Merriam decided to land &ndash; La Paz the Beautiful, a little harbourless
town smothered in a living green ribbon that banded the foot of a cloud- piercing mountain.
Here the little steamer stopped to tread water while the captain&rsquo;s dory took him ashore that
he might feel the pulse of the cocoanut market. Merriam went too, with his suit case, and
remained.
Kalb, the vice-consul, a Gr?co-Armenian citizen of the United States, born in
Hessen-Darmstadt, and edu- cated in Cincinnati ward primaries, considered all Ameri- cans
his brothers and bankers. He attached himself to Merriam&rsquo;s elbow, introduced him to every
one in La Paz who wore shoes, borrowed ten dollars and went back to his hammock.
There was a little wooden hotel in the edge of a banana grove, facing the sea, that
catered to the tastes of the few foreigners that had dropped out of the world into the t,ri,qte
Peruvian town. At Kalb&rsquo;s introductory: &ldquo;Shake hands with &ndash; ,&rdquo; he had obediently exchanged
manual salutations with a German doctor, one French and two Italian merchants, and three
or four Americans who were spoken of as gold men, rubber men, mahogany men &ndash; anything
but men of living tissue.
After dinner Merriam sat in a corner of the broad front galeria with Bibb, a Vermonter
interested in hydraulic mining, and smoked and drank Scotch &ldquo;smoke.&rdquo; The moonlit sea,
spreading infinitely before him, seemed to separate him beyond all apprehension from his
old life. The horrid tragedy in which he had played such a disas- trous part now began, for
the first time since he stole on board the fruiter, a wretched fugitive, to lose its sharper
outlines. Distance lent assuagement to his view. Bibb had opened the flood-gates of a
stream of long-dammed discourse, overjoyed to have captured an audience that had not
suffered under a hundred repetitions of his views and theories.
&ldquo;One year more,&rdquo; said Bibb, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll go back to God&rsquo;s country. Oh, I know it&rsquo;s pretty
here, and you get dolce far niente banded to you in chunks, but this country wasn&rsquo;t made for
a white man to live in. You&rsquo;ve got to have to plug through snow now and then, and see a
game of baseball and wear a stiff collar and have a policeman cuss you. Still, La Paz is a good
sort of a pipe-dreamy old hole. And Mrs. Conant is here. When any of us feels particularly
like jumping into the sea we rush around to her house and propose. It&rsquo;s nicer to be rejected
by Mrs. Conant than it is to be drowned. And they say drowning is a delightful sensation.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Many like her here?&rdquo; asked Merriam.&ldquo;Not anywhere,&rdquo; said Bibb, with a comfortable sigh.
She&rsquo;s the only white woman in La Paz. The rest range from a dappled dun to the colour
of a b-flat piano key. She&rsquo;s been here a year. Comes from &ndash; well, you know how a woman
can talk &ndash; ask &lsquo;em to say &lsquo;string&rsquo; and they&rsquo;ll say &lsquo;crow&rsquo;s foot&rsquo; or &lsquo;cat&rsquo;s cradle.&rsquo; Some- times
you&rsquo;d think she was from Oshkosh, and again from Jacksonville, Florida, and the next day
from Cape Cod.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mystery?&rdquo; ventured Merriam.
&ldquo;M &ndash; well, she looks it; but her talk&rsquo;s translucent enough. But that&rsquo;s a woman. I
suppose if the Sphinx were to begin talking she&rsquo;d merely say: &lsquo;Goodness me! more visitors
coming for dinner, and nothing to eat but the sand which is here.&rsquo; But you won&rsquo;t think about
that when you meet her, Merriam. You&rsquo;ll propose to her too.&rdquo;
To make a hard story soft, Merriam did meet her and propose to her. He found her to
be a woman in black with hair the colour of a bronze turkey&rsquo;s wings, and mysterious,
remembering eyes that - well, that looked as if she might have been a trained nurse looking
on when Eve was created. Her words and manner, though, were translucent, as Bibb had
said. She spoke, vaguely, of friends in California and some of the lower parishes in Louisiana.
The tropical climate and indolent life suited her; she had thought of buying an orange grove
later on; La Paz. all in all, charmed her.
Merriam&rsquo;s courtship of the Sphinx lasted three months, although be did not know that
he was courting her. He was using her as an antidote for remorse, until he found, too late,
that he had acquired the habit. During that time he had received no news from home. Wade
did not know where he was; and he was not sure of Wade&rsquo;s exact address, and was afraid to
write. He thought he had better let matters rest as they were for a while.
One afternoon he and Mrs. Conant hired two ponies and rode out along the mountain
trail as far as the little cold river that came tumbling down the foothills. There they stopped
for a drink, and Merriam spoke his piece &ndash; he proposed, as Bibb had prophesied.
Mrs. Conant gave him one glance of brilliant tenderness, and then her face took on
such a strange, haggard look that Merriam was shaken out of his intoxication and back to his
senses.
&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Florence,&rdquo; he said, releasing her hand; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll have to hedge on
part of what I said. I can&rsquo;t ask you to marry me, of course. I killed a man in New York &ndash; a man
who was my friend - shot him down &ndash; in quite a cowardly manner, I understand. Of course,
the drinking didn&rsquo;t excuse it. Well, I couldn&rsquo;t resist having my say; and I&rsquo;ll always mean it. I&rsquo;m
here as a fugitive from justice, and &ndash; I suppose that ends our acquaintance.&ldquo;Mrs. Conant plucked little leaves assiduously from the low-hanging branch of a lime
tree.
&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; she said, in low and oddly uneven tones; &ldquo;but that depends upon you.
I&rsquo;ll be as honest as you were. I poisoned my husband. I am a self-made widow. A man cannot
love a murderess. So I suppose that ends our acquaintance.&rdquo;
She looked up at him slowly. His face turned a little pale, and he stared at her blankly,
like a deaf-and-dumb man who was wondering what it was all about.
She took a swift step toward him, with stiffened arms and eyes blazing.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me like that!&rdquo; she cried, as though she were in acute pain. &ldquo;Curse me, or
turn your back on me, but don&rsquo;t look that way. Am I a woman to be beaten? If I could show
you &ndash; here on my arms, and on my back are scars &ndash; and it has been more than a year &ndash; scars
that he made in his brutal rages. A holy nun would have risen and struck the fiend down. Yes,
I killed him. The foul and horrible words that he hurled at me that last day are repeated in
my ears every night when I sleep. And then came his blows, and the end of my endurance. I
got the poison that afternoon. It was his custom to drink every night in the library before
going to bed a hot punch made of rum and wine. Only from my fair hands would he receive
it &ndash; because he knew the fumes of spirits always sickened me. That night when the maid
brought it to me I sent her downstairs on an errand. Before taking him his drink I went to my
little private cabinet and poured into it more than a tea- spoonful of tincture of aconite &ndash;
enough to kill three men, so I had learned. I had drawn $6,000 that I had in bank, and with
that and a few things in a satchel I left the house without any one seeing me. As I passed the
library I heard him stagger up and fall heavily on a couch. I took a night train for New
Orleans, and from there I sailed to the Bermudas. I finally cast anchor in La Paz. And now
what have you to say? Can you open your mouth?&rdquo;
Merriam came back to life.
&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;I want you. I don&rsquo;t care what you&rsquo;ve done. If the world &ndash;
&ldquo;
&ldquo;Ralph,&rdquo; she interrupted, almost with a scream, &ldquo;be my world!&rdquo;
Her eyes melted; she relaxed magnificentlv and swayed toward Merriam so suddenly
that he had to jump to catch her.
Dear me! in such scenes how the talk runs into artificial prose. But it can&rsquo;t be helped.
It&rsquo;s the subconscious smell of the footlights&rsquo; smoke that&rsquo;s in all of us. Stir the depths of your
cook&rsquo;s soul sufficiently and she will discourse in Bulwer-Lyttonese.Merriam and Mrs. Conant were very happy. He announced their engagement at the
Hotel Orilla del Mar. Eight foreigners and four native Astors pounded his back and shouted
insincere congratulations at him. Pedrito, the Castilian-mannered barkeep, was goaded to
extra duty until his agility would have turned a Boston cherry- phosphate clerk a pale lilac
with envy.
They were both very happy. According to the strange mathematics of the god of mutual
affinity, the shadows that clouded their pasts when united became only half as dense
instead of darker. They shut the world out and bolted the doors. Each was the other&rsquo;s world.
Mrs. Conant lived again. The remembering look left her eyes Merriam was with her every
moment that was possible. On a little plateau under a grove of palms and calabash trees
they were going to build a fairy bungalow. They were to be married in two months. Many
hours of the day they had their heads together over the house plans. Their joint capital
would set up a business in fruit or woods that would yield a comfortable support. &ldquo;Good
night, my world,&rdquo; would say Mrs. Conant every evening when Merriam left her for his hotel.
They were very happy. Their love had, circumstantially, that element of melancholy in it that
it seems to require to attain its supremest elevation. And it seemed that their mutual great
misfortune or sin was a bond that nothing could sever.
One day a steamer hove in the offing. Bare-legged and bare-shouldered La Paz
scampered down to the beach, for the arrival of a steamer was their loop-the-loop, circus,
Emancipation Day and four-o&rsquo;clock tea.
When the steamer was near enough, wise ones pro- claimed that she was the Pajaro,
bound up-coast from Callao to Panama.
The Paiaro put on brakes a mile off shore. Soon a boat came bobbing shoreward.
Merriam strolled down on the beach to look on. In the shallow water the Carib sailors
sprang out and dragged the boat with a mighty rush to the firm shingle. Out climbed the
purser, the captain and two passengers, ploughing their way through the deep sand toward
the hotel. Merriam glanced toward them with the mild interest due to strangers. There was
something familiar to him in the walk of one of the pas- sengers. He looked again, and his
blood seemed to turn to strawberry ice cream in his veins. Burly, arrogant, debonair as ever,
H. Ferguson Hedges, the man he had killed, was coming toward him ten feet away.
When Hedges saw Merriam his face flushed a dark red. Then he shouted in his old, bluff
way: &ldquo;Hello, Merriam. Glad to see you. Didn&rsquo;t expect to find you out here. Quinby, this is my
old friend Merriam, of New York &ndash; Merriam, Mr. Quinby.&rdquo;
Merriam gave Hedges and then Quinby an ice-cold hand. &ldquo;Br-r-r-r!&rdquo; said Hedges. &ldquo;But
you&rsquo;ve got a frappéd flipper! Man, you&rsquo;re not well. You&rsquo;re as yellow as a Chinaman. Malarial
here? Steer us to a bar if there is such a thing, and let&rsquo;s take a prophylactic.&rdquo;
Merriam, still half comatose, led them toward the Hotel Orilla del Mar.&ldquo;Quinby and I&rdquo; explained Hedges, puffing through the slippery sand, &ldquo;are looking out
along the coast for some investments. We&rsquo;ve just come up from Concepción and Valparaiso
and Lima. The captain of this sub- sidized ferry boat told us there was some good picking
around here in silver mines. So we got off. Now, where is that café, Merriam? Oh, in this
portable soda water pavilion?&rdquo;
Leaving Quinby at the bar, Hedges drew Merriam side.
&ldquo;Now, what does this mean?&rdquo; he said, with gruff kindness. &ldquo;Are you sulking about that
fool row we had?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; stammered Merriam &ndash; &ldquo;I heard &ndash; they told me you were &ndash; that I had &ldquo;
&ldquo;Well, you didn&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Hedges. &ldquo;That fool young ambulance surgeon told
Wade I was a can- didate for a coffin just because I&rsquo;d got tired and quit breathing. I laid up in
a private hospital for a month; but here I am, kicking as hard as ever. Wade and I tried to find
you, but couldn&rsquo;t. Now, Merriam, shake hands and forget it all. I was as much to blame as
you were; and the shot really did me good &ndash; I came out of the hospital as healthy and fit as a
cab horse. Come on; that drink&rsquo;s waiting.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Old man,&rdquo; said Merriam, brokenly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to thank you &ndash; I &ndash; well, you
know &ndash; &ldquo;
&ldquo;Oh, forget it,&rdquo; boomed Hedges. &ldquo;Quinby&rsquo;ll die of thirst if we don&rsquo;t join him.&rdquo;
Bibb was sitting on the shady side of the gallery waiting for the eleven-o&rsquo;clock breakfast.
Presently Merriam came out and joined him. His eye was strangely bright.
&ldquo;Bibb, my boy,&rdquo; said he, slowly waving his hand, &ldquo;do you see those mountains and that
sea and sky and sun- shine? &ndash; they&rsquo;re mine, Bibbsy &ndash; all mine.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You go in,&rdquo; said Bibb, &ldquo;and take eight grains of quinine, right away. It won&rsquo;t do in this
climate for a man to get to thinking he&rsquo;s Rockefeller, or James O&rsquo;Neill either.
Inside, the purser was untying a great roll of newspapers, many of them weeks old,
gathered in the lower ports by the Pajaro to be distributed at casual stopping-places. Thus
do the beneficent voyagers scatter news and enter- tainment among the prisoners of sea
and mountains. Tio Pancho, the hotel proprietor, set his great silver- rimmed aiteojos upon
his nose and divided the papers into a number of smaller rolls. A barefooted muchacho
dashed in, desiring the post of messenger.
&ldquo;Bien venido,&rdquo; said Tio Pancho. &ldquo;This to Se?ora Conant; that to el Doctor S-S-Schlegel &ndash;
Dios! what a name to say! - that to Se?or Davis &ndash; one for Don Alberto. These two for theCasa de Huespedes, Numero 6, en la calle de las Buenas Gracias. And say to them all,
muchacho, that the Pajaro sails for Panama at three this afternoon. If any have letters to
send by the post, let them come quickly, that they may first pass through the correo.&rdquo;
Mrs. Conant received her roll of newspapers at four o&rsquo;clock. The boy was late in
delivering them, because he had been deflected from his duty by an iguana that crossed his
path and to which he immediately gave chase. But it made no hardship, for she had no
letters to send.
She was idling in a hammock in the patio of the house that she occupied, half awake,
half happily dreaming of the paradise that she and Merriam had created out of the wrecks of
their pasts. She was content now for the horizon of that shimmering sea to be the horizon of
her life. They had shut out the world and closed the door.
Merriam was coming to her house at seven, after his dinner at the hotel. She would put
on a white dress and an apricot-coloured lace mantilla, and they would walk an hour under
the cocoanut palms by the lagoon. She smiled contentedly, and chose a paper at random
from the roll the boy had brought.
At first the words of a certain headline of a Sunday newspaper meant nothing to her;
they conveyed only a visualized sense of familiarity. The largest type ran thus: &ldquo;Lloyd B.
Conant secures divorce.&rdquo; And then the subheadings: &ldquo;Well-known Saint Louis paint
manufac- turer wins suit, pleading one year&rsquo;s absence of wife.&rdquo; &ldquo;Her mysterious
disappearance recalled.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing has been heard of her since.&rdquo;
Twisting herself quickly out of the hammock, Mrs. Conant&rsquo;s eye soon traversed the
half-column of the &ldquo;Recall.&rdquo; It ended thus: &ldquo;It will be remembered that Mrs. Conant
disappeared one evening in March of last year. It was freely rumoured that her marriage
with Lloyd B. Conant resulted in much unhappiness. Stories were not wanting to the effect
that his cruelty toward his wife had more than once taken the form of physical abuse. After
her departure a full bottle of tincture of aconite, a deadly poison, was found in a small
medicine cabinet in her bedroom. This might have been an indication that she meditated
suicide. It is supposed abandoned such an intention if she possessed it, and left her home
instead.&rdquo;
Mrs. Conant slowly dropped the paper, and sat on a chair, clasping her hands tightly.
&ldquo;Let me think &ndash; O God! &ndash; let me think,&rdquo; she whis- pered. &ldquo;I took the bottle with me &hellip; I
threw it out of the window of the train &hellip; I &ndash; &hellip; there was another bottle in the cabinet &hellip;
there were two, side by side &ndash; the aconite &ndash; and the valerian that I took when I could not
sleep &hellip; If they found the aconite bottle full, why &ndash; but, he is alive, of course &ndash; I gave him
only a harmless dose of valerian &hellip; I am not a murderess in fact &hellip; Ralph, I &ndash; 0 God, don&rsquo;t
let this be a dream!&ldquo;She went into the part of the house that she rented from the old Peruvian man and his
wife, shut the door, and walked up and down her room swiftly and feverishly for half an hour.
Merriam&rsquo;s photograph stood in a frame on a table. She picked it up, looked at it with a smile
of exquisite tenderness, and &ndash; dropped four tears on it. And Merriam only twenty rods away!
Then she stood still for ten minutes, looking into space. She looked into space through a
slowly opening door. On her side of the door was the building material for a castle of
Romance &ndash; love, an Arcady of waving palms, a lullaby of waves on the shore of a haven of
rest, respite, peace, a lotus land of dreamy ease and security &ndash; a life of poetry and heart&rsquo;s
ease and refuge. Romanticist, will you tell me what Mrs. Conant saw on the other side of the
door? You cannot? &ndash; that is, you will not? Very well; then listen. She saw herself go into a
department store and buy five spools of silk thread and three yards of gingham to make an
apron for the cook. &ldquo;Shall I charge it, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked the clerk. As she walked out a lady
whom she met greeted her cordially. &ldquo;Oh, where did you get the pattern for those sleeves,
dear Mrs. Conant?&rdquo; she said. At the corner a policeman helped her across the street and
touched his helmet. &ldquo;Any callers?&rdquo; she asked the maid when she reached home. &ldquo;Mrs.
Waldron,&rdquo; answered the maid, and the tqvo Misses Jenkinson.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said. You
may bring me a cup of tea, Maggie.&rdquo;
Mrs. Conant went to the door and called Angela, the old Peruvian woman. &ldquo;If Mateo is
there send him to me.&rdquo; Mateo, a half-breed, shuffling and old but efficient, came. &ldquo;Is there a
steamer or a vessel of any kind leaving this coast to-night or to-morrow that I can get
passage on?&rdquo; she asked.
Mateo considered.
&ldquo;At Punta Reina, thirty miles down the coast, se?ora,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;there is a small
steamer loading with cinchona and dyewoods. She sails for San Francisco to-morrow at
sunrise. So says my brother, who arrived in his sloop to-day, passing by Punta Reina.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You must take me in that sloop to that steamer to-night. Will you do that?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Perhaps &ndash; &rdquo; Mateo shrugged a suggestive shoul- der. Mrs. Conant took a handful of
money from a drawer and gave it to him.
&ldquo;Get the sloop ready behind the little point of land below the town,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;Get
sailors, and be ready to sail at six o&rsquo;clock. In half an hour bring a cart partly filled with straw
into the patio here, and take my trunk to the sloop. There is more money yet. Now, hurry.&rdquo;
For one time Mateo walked away without shuffling his feet.
&ldquo;Angela,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Conant, almost fiercely, &ldquo;come and help me pack. I am going away.
Out with this trunk. My clothes first. Stir yourself. Those dark dresses first. Hurry.&ldquo;From the first she did not waver from her decision. Her view was clear and final. Her
door had opened and let the world in. Her love for Merriam was not lessened; but it now
appeared a hopeless and unrealizable thing. The visions of their future that had seemed so
blissful and complete had vanished. She tried to assure herself that her renunciation was
rather for his sake than for her own. Now that she was cleared of her burden &ndash; at least,
technically &ndash; would not his own weigh too heavily upon him? If she should cling to him,
would not the difference forever silently mar and corrode their happiness? Thus she
reasoned; but there were a thousand little voices calling to her that she could feel rather
than hear, like the hum of distant, powerful machinery &ndash; the little voices of the world, that,
when raised in unison, can send their insistent call through the thickest door.
Once while packing, a brief shadow of the lotus dream came back to her. She held
Merriam&rsquo;s picture to her heart with one hand, while she threw a pair of shoes into the trunk
with her other.
At six o&rsquo;clock Mateo returned and reported the sloop ready. He and his brother lifted
the trunk into the cart, covered it with straw and conveyed it to the point of embarkation.
From there they transferred it on board in the sloop&rsquo;s dory. Then Mateo returned for
additional orders.
Mrs. Conant was ready. She had settled all business matters with Angela, and was
impatiently waiting. She wore a long, loose black-silk duster that she often walked about in
when the evenino&rsquo;s were chilly. On her head was a small round hat, and over it the
apricot-coloured lace mantilla.
Dusk had quickly followed the short twilight. Mateo led her by dark and grass-grown
streets toward the point behind which the sloop was anchored. On turning a corner they
beheld the Hotel Orilla del Mar three streets away, nebulously aglow with its array of
kerosene lamps.
Mrs. Conant paused, with streamin eyes. &ldquo;I must, I must see him once before I go,&rdquo; she
murmured in anguish. But even then she did not falter in her decision. Quickly she invented
a plan by which she might speak to him, and yet make her departure without his knowing.
She would walk past the hotel, ask some one to call him out and talk a few moments on
some trivial excuse, leaving him expecting to see her at her home at seven.
She unpinned her hat and gave it to Mateo. &ldquo;Keep this, and wait here till I come,&rdquo; she
ordered. Then she draped the mantilla over her head as she usually did when walking after
sunset, and went straight to the Orilla del Mar.
She was glad to see the bulky, white-clad figure of Tio Pancho standing alone on the
gallery.&ldquo;Tio Pancho,&rdquo; she said, with a charming smile, &ldquo;may I trouble you to ask Mr. Merriam to
come out for just a few moments that I may speak with him?&rdquo;
Tio Pancho bowed as an elephant bows.
&ldquo;Buenas tardes, Se?ora Conant,&rdquo; he said, as a cavalier talks. And then he went on, less
at his ease:
&ldquo;But does not the se?ora know that Se?or Merriam sailed on the Pajaro for Panama at
three o&rsquo;clock of this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
